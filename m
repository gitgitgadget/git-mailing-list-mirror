Some of the weirdness is caused by the '-' at the _beginning_ of the
suffixes, because versioncmp() gets confused by suffixes starting with
the same character(s).

versioncmp() consumes two tagnames up to the first different character
and then calls swap_prereleases() to try to match prerelease suffixes
starting at those characters.  This works fine when comparing a
release with a prerelease, e.g. "2.6.0" and "2.6.0-RC1", because
swap_prereleases() gets "" and "-RC1" and the latter does match one of
the configured suffixes.  However, when comparing two prereleases,
e.g. "2.6.0-beta1" and "2.6.0-RC1", then the '-' is consumed from both
tagnames because the first differing characters are 'b' and 'R', thus
swap_prereleases() gets "beta1" and "RC1", which, of course, don't
match any of the configured suffixes without the leading '-'.

It's way past my bedtime, so for the time being I can only come up
with a hacky configuration workaround that seems to deliver the
expected results:

[versionsort]
	prereleasesuffix = beta
	prereleasesuffix = -beta
	prereleasesuffix = RC
	prereleasesuffix = -RC

Best,
GÃ¡bor
