I understand I am counted as one of the "git designers"; I have
been aware of this thread but I have to admit that I am way
behind and have not caught up with the issues.  I'll try to
comment on them when I feel I know enough about the issues
involved, but not right now.  Sorry.

Please do not start explain them to me yet, I am behind due to
lack of time and you would end up wasting your time.
