That line looks like it's the "close" on the pipe. If it's dying racily
that could mean that msmtp for some reason is not eating all of the
data and we're getting EPIPE (though that seems weird, since we're just
dumping the message until EOF). Or possibly msmtp is sometimes exiting
non-zero.

Capturing an "strace" for a failing run would be helpful. If that's not
possible, something like this patch might help diagnose it:

diff --git a/git-send-email.perl b/git-send-email.perl
index eea0a517f..32d34f995 100755
