Oh, pleaaaze, no (on the subject line). No need for more fuel in this topic.

The evidence is that Dscho says so.
The counter evidence is that Amir says otherwise.

Knowing Dscho, I consider an occasional rash of quick-shooting possible;
I consider it impossible that he's dishonest with us here.

Note that what is an "explanation" to one person may not be one to
another one, especially across two language and culture barriers. In
particular, my statement about Dscho's credibility does not imply any
statement about Amir's.

[more detailed proposal cut out]

Looking at the history of our wiki I don't see any need to overshoot as
a result of this mostly singular incident. It should suffice to

- reactivate Amir's account
- make a clear statement about user pages (limit, discourage or disable)

Michael

P.S.: wiki discussions should stay on this list to avoid the type of
dis-association which has happened with git-scm.com and whatever names
itself "The Git Community Foo".
