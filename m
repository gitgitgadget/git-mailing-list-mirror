It is announced both on GitHub Blog and in GitHub announcements, see
  http://github.com/blog/717-git-user-survey-2010
  http://img.skitch.com/20100914-q4wuyf6i8f2yt9ef2tnxaifc1a.png

Besides that, it is announced on Git Wiki, on Git Homepage, and also on
repo.or.cz, git.kernel.org, GitHub, Gitorious, InDefero, Codaset,
Codebase, Unfuddle, Savannah, SourceForge and Beanstalk.  It would be
(or is) announced on Bettercodes.org.  I have send request for=20
announcement also to Codesion, Assembla, The Chaw, ProjectLocker,
CipherHive and GitFarm, but I didn't get any response yet (I might
not found and used correct contact information).

I am still sending announcements to other git hosting sites...
