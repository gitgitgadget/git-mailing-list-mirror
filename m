The compelling thing to me is that just about every other failure mode
of the pager will result in a SIGPIPE, so the "be nice with a
non-working pager" trick really only applies to the very narrow case of
execve() failing.

I did assume that a bogus option like:

  # oops, there is no -l option!
  GIT_PAGER='less -l' git log

would be a plausible such misconfiguration, but to my surprise "less"
prints "hey, there is no -l option" and then pages anyway. How helpful. :)

But something like:

  # oops, there is no -X option!
  GIT_PAGER='cat -X' git log

yields just:

  cat: invalid option -- 'X'
  Try 'cat --help' for more information.

with no other output. It's a little confusing if you don't realize that
"cat" is the pager. We obviously don't want to complain about SIGPIPE,
because it's common for the user to simply exit the pager without
reading all of the possible data. It might be nice if we printed some
message when the pager exits non-zero, but I'd worry there might be
false positives, depending on the behavior of various pagers.
