Hrm. I think this was introduced by my lockfile series, since before
that the memory would have remained valid (but with its "active" flag
unset, which is enough for delete_tempfile() to happily return early).

Part of my reason for switching delete_tempfile() to take a
pointer-to-pointer was so that we had to investigate each such call. But
obviously I failed to analyze this case correctly. :(

I'm not sure I follow here. It seems like write_locked_index() has three
outcomes:

  - if there was an error, the lock is rolled back

  - if we were successful and the caller asked for CLOSE_LOCK, we remain
    locked

  - if we were successful and the caller asked for COMMIT_LOCK, we
    commit the lock

It sounds like you are considering the first outcome a bug, but I think
it is intentional. Without that, every caller of write_locked_index()
would need to release the lock themselves. That's especially cumbersome
if they called with COMMIT_LOCK, as they otherwise can assume that
write_locked_index() has released the lock one way or another.

So I actually think that just switching to a "struct tempfile **" here
is a reasonable solution (I'd also be fine with doing this and then
having do_write_locked_index() rollback the lock itself on error).

Or am I missing something?
