Sure, I'm aware of that. The initial goal was to make something which=20
works as the current contrib/workdir/git-new-workdir, just=20
cross-platform. Then we can take it from there, step by step, until we=20
have something which works safely; instead of taking a single big leap.

I'm actually not sure that it's impossible to make it safe.
My implementation works by redirecting files into the real repo.=20
However, we can also detect when redirection is in effect, and do=20
extra 'maintainance' things then, to avoid the bad effects.

For example, when setting up a workdir, we could duplicate
         <real repo>/.git/refs/*
into    <real repo>/.git/refs/workdir-<sha1>/*
(<sha1> being the sha1 of the abs path to the workdir)
and have the redirection mechanism redirect all git_path("refs/*") to=20
the duplicated locations. That way, when pulling in the workdir, it=20
wouldn't create havok with the real repo's refs. Then in the real=20
repo, you can easily refer to the refs in from the workdir too, when=20
you need to.

There are several possibilities here. Since file redirection works=20
from the beginning, we have a place to start, which can slowly migrate=20
into whatever. When you think about it, my approach is kinda similar=20
to the '.git file' approach, just that I don't redirect everything=20
from the start, just parts to make it work as today on Linux. In the=20
end my technique could also redirect everything into the real repo,=20
giving you the same effect as the '.git file'.
