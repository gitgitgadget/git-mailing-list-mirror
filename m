Fair. I knew what I was doing was probably not kosher. Still, the
documentation says

           git stash store [(-m | --message) <message>] [-q | --quiet] <commit>

and then later clarifying

           Store a given stash created via git stash create (which is
a dangling merge commit) in the stash ref, updating the stash reflog.
This is intended to be useful for scripts.
           It is probably not the command you want to use; see "push" above.

I knew git stash store is meant to be used with git stash create. But
I didn't expect to be able to create a stash entry that I wouldn't be
able to drop.

I can see why I deserve the mess I made for myself. But I'm also
inclined to think that if I've been allowed to make said mess, I
should similarly be allowed to clean it up, without having to manually
delete the entry from the stash reflog. (In case someone else finds
themselves in a similar mess, I just went into the
.git/logs/refs/stash and deleted line of the offending stash entry)

I think a more user-friendly behavior is to either prevent the user
from making the mess, or not prevent the user from cleaning it up.
Doing both seems a tad overzealous. Hard for me to say which is
better. For example, it's not immediately clear, to me, why git stash
drop cares about the validity of stash entries to be dropped. But
maybe there are edge cases where it's good to be defensive here.
