The solution to this that I ended up with is a blend of many different implementations of git (3) on my dev box. EGit in ECLIPSE, standard windows git for working in a CMD prompt, the Cygwin git in Cygwin bash. On another dev box I also have git bash and Ming, which make things easier, but I have to work in Cygwin for some subsystems. I end up using relative paths with / instead of \ in all cases, and git seems happy, except for /cygdrive/c. Absolute Windows and Cygwin paths simply do not work consistently, from my experience from Cygwin because of the way bash passes arguments to non-cygwin tools. You need to be very careful and properly escape "\" to do so, and account for cygwin drive handling otherwise. So a non-cygwin tool from Cygwin can process c:\ but Cygwin itself will not. My own expectations are that git built for Cygwin would understand this, but git built for Windows would not, and that I should account for this through my PATH, selecting Cygwin git in Cygwin and Windows git elsewhere. Reality may not reflect this, so I use relative paths in all cases (non-reality being that the git port for Cygwin is different than the git port for Windows, which it does not appear to be).

Cheers,
Randall
