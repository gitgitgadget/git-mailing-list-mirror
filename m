Dear Colleagues,

I hope you know our conference CSCC: Circuits, Systems, Communications and Computers
www.cscc.co The Conference is now in its 19 year and in 2015 is organized in the
wonderful and historical island of Zakynthos in Greece (July 16,17,18,19,20 2015 /
Five days).   
The conference is indexed in ISI, SCOPUS, Engineering Villeage, EI Compendex, IET etc
and has collaboration with important scientific societies and 3 universities:
More Details: www.cscc.co
Last year the Proceedings of CSCC were published in 12 Volumes (hard-copy) and one
CD (containing the material of these 12 volumes) and this material was distributed
to our authors. 
See a full report and many wonderful photos from the CSCC 2014 here:
inase-news.blogspot.com/2014/12/post-conference-report-inase_15.html  www.cscc14.org

CSCC has always famous plenary speakers from prestigious universities, IEEE Fellows
(www.cscc.co / last year: www.cscc14.org) and this year we have arranged
post-conference publication of all the extended version of all the accepted papers
in 36 ISI/SCI Indexed Journals. We have also 4 Tutorials by well-known colleagues.

We would like to invite you to organize a Special Session or Workshop. For Special
Session / Workshop organizers we give financial support (honorarium), free
publication, air tickets and hotel expenses. Successful special session organizers
will be automatically included in the committee of CSCC 2016, as well as we will
jointly examine their participation in the Editorial Board in one of our 36
collaborating ISI/SCI Journals. Special Session organizers are also appointed
Associate Editors in the conference Proceedings. We will also give several mailing
lists to the Session Organizers to send their own Call For Papers.

So, far we have 16 Special Sessions and we believe that we will reach more than 80
until July. Send the proposal of your Special Session to us now following the
instructions of cscc.co 

The list of the reviewers that will undertake the peer review process and their
emails is included in the proceedings and is also sent to ISI, SCOPUS and other
indexes.

See you in Zakynthos, Greece in July
