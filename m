The git developer community flourishes without official blogs, and it
did so even before we had a webpage. In truth, I visit the mailing
list archives more often than I visit the webpage. It doesn't *need* a
blog (or a forum, or a tracker, or whatever), but some people might
find such things helpful. Personally, I'm a huge fan of having it all
in one place.

There are no forums suitable for everyone who are interested in git
development. We can (sort of) rely on package maintainers for the
various distros to keep track of groundbreaking changes. People who
compile from source are sort of on their own if they don't want to
follow the mailing list or in some other way find out what's going
on. I don't have a problem with that, and it matches what I'd have
expected myself if I was building something from source.

Considering the successes of the wars on alcohol, poverty, drugs and
terror, I think we should give some serious thought to declaring war
on peace.
