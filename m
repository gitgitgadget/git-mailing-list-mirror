Hi Jakub,

Thanks for taking the time to go through my long (somewhat
unstructured) note.

I just opened up survs.com, signed up for a free account and created a
survey with two compulsory questions- I couldn't submit the results
without filling up both of them. Then I looked at the statistics and I
saw a '0' in incomplete- I'm confused. Perhaps we can email survs.com
and ask them?

Same. I also think "wizard" is a bad idea for this- it would make it
look like some sort of online test :p

Sure. Again, we should perhaps email survs.com for such
clarifications.

Sounds good.

Hm, yes. I didn't think about this.

Oh, ok- we should take too much trouble though; we should keep
cost-to-benefit ratio in mind.

Ofcourse. We should only remove options that don't necessarily tell us
very much.

Hm, I hadn't thought of that. I suppose it can be used to advertise
various applications.

I see. How are we going to tackle this in future?

Interesting.

Sounds good.

I suppose we could always work out a way to display the results from
the information Survs.com gives us.

I just meant it as a sanity check in case people enter "34 years old"
and the like.

Nice histogram! How did we manage to do this in 2009? Did we use a
custom-made application to do the survey?

Oh, right. I didn't think about this.

Ah, I thought so.

I see. Any thoughts on long-term plans? Do we pay for the premium
account or do we build a custom application?
