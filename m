I read that as OO bringing in more programmers capable of creating
problems than those capable of fixing them.

It is not the fault of OO in itself, but it is the bottom line that
counts: if it draws the wrong audience for the wrong reasons, it
better had great benefits to offset that.  Not quite unsimilar with
communism: the idea is great in principle, but the idea has no
built-in self-check.  Capitalism, in contrast, is a distasteful idea
at its heart, but it is rooted soundly in individual egoism.  Which
does not make it any less distasteful, but at least it tends to work.
