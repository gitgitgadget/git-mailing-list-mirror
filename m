If the current oidset implementation is so bad, why not replace it with
one based on oid_array? ;-)

Intuitively I'd try a hashmap with no payload and open addressing via
sha1hash(), which should reduce memory allocations quite a bit -- no
need to store hash codes and next pointers, only an array of object IDs
with a fill rate of 50% or so.  Deletions are a bit awkward with that
scheme, though; they could perhaps be implemented as insertions into a
second hashmap.

Balancing might become a problem.  Your cat-file example should be fine,
but someone could decide to add only hashes with a certain prefix to
their skiplist, and lookups would lopsided.

But first we'd need something like test-sha1-array for oidset and
some kind of performance tests based on these helpers, right?
