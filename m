Indeed, the world would be a more efficient place if we all did
everything perfectly all the time. Sadly, that's not how it works. :)

This version looks good to me. Thanks for modernizing things.

I don't think it's worth re-rolling, but one thing to think about for
future cleanups: you split the patches by touched area, not by
functionality. So the first three patches have a "while we're here..."
that has to explain why dropping the "static" is the right thing over
and over. If you instead did the error-handling fixes independently
first, then you could lump the "static" cleanups together with one
explanation (possibly even just as part of the 4th patch).
