No, I don't think so. I don't recall offhand whether the C standard
allows integers that are not powers of 2. But if it does, and somebody
develops such a platform, I have very little sympathy.

My comment was mostly "this is the only other restriction I can think
of, and it is crazy".

Yeah, I had assumed you would also switch to some form of unsigned type
either way.

I thought that series was in "next" already, but I see it isn't yet. I'd
still wait until the sha1_to_hex() solution settles, and then copy it.

I dunno. It hides a lot of magic without saving a lot of lines in the
caller, and the callers have to make sure "array" is an array and that
"index" is unsigned.

E.g., in this code:

The truly ugly part is the repeated STRBUF_INIT. :)

I think it would be preferable to just fix it inline in each place.
