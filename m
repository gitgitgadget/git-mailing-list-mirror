Hi,

I show him how to use it. And that's actually a fine analogy: While the 
principle of a screw is quite clever, working with it -- even with an 
electric screwdriver -- is easy. And the most important part: I never read 
instructions on how to use it. I saw somebody use it and -- voila! -- I 
can use it myself.

I think that the importance of documentation is overrated. Users have come 
to expect to use programs without reading a manual. DWIM comes to mind.

Ciao,
