No. I said that tongue-in-cheek.

But my point was: Since the current developers evidently are comfortable 
with the current set of command line options, and the consistency thereof, 
it needs more than some hand waving comments about what you want changed, 
and how.

To state it clearly: if you have any concrete wishes as to the 
clarification of Git, and to make it easier for beginners (at the same 
time not making it harder on others), I will be very glad to know them. 
And I think that the list will welcome these equally eagerly.

Ciao,
Dscho
