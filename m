It really is about the "seriously".  If you don't, you'll get your
mail outright ignored.

Many of us get lots[1] of mail per day, and have no time nor will to
scroll around in the message reading long (untrimmed) quoted parts
that are out of order, let alone click around in the corresponding
thread to remember the context.  If you want your mail to be read, you
should take some time to make it *easy* to read on its own.


[1] I'm luckily not one of them, but I hear high-profile project
maintainers get hundreds.
