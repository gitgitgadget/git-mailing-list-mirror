I don't know much about Subversionisms, never really having used Subversion 
(but I have used CVS extensively, so I am a bit damaged), so I cannot 
comment on that.

The problem, at least for Swedish, is that if I want to translate that 
sentence, finding a good word to replace "commit" is very difficult, even 
when it is used properly like this. Some things just don't translate very 
well into other languages.

Speaking of Linus, his native tounge is the same as mine, so I will let him 
have the power to override my Swedish translation of Git & co, if he sees 
fit :-)
