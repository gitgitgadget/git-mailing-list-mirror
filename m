If I then use Fork's ability to Stage chunks of text containing these (or possibly not containing, but close after) I get this failure reported.

I suspect this is an encoding mismatch, but I wonder why it doesn't show 
up on my system but does on Paul's. Anyway, I would be surprised if the 
two bugs in Git Gui and Fork Gui are related in any way other than two 
programmers making the same mistake by chance.

I use Outlook 2010 for reading HTML emails at $DAYJOB. I went and 
checked, and there is an option to use "> " in Options -> Mail -> 
Replies and Forwards.
