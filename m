Yeah, I think those are a bit more obvious.

I think it's the right thing here. Inside hold_lock_file_for_update_timeout(),
we'd pass errno to unable_to_lock_die(), etc. So if there is a code path
in lock_file_timeout() that isn't setting errno properly, we should
probably be fixing that.

Another option would be to just pass LOCK_DIE_ON_ERROR here, but I think
for this use I prefer the smaller "unable to lock" to the big "another
git process may have crashed" advice message we'd give in that case.
