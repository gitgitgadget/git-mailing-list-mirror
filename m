It is strange, though, that Jakub is the only one I've noticed who isn't 
able to do me the courtesy of addressing me directly when replying to 
me.

We must not live in the same virtual world then.  This _is_ common 
netiquette in the Linux world.

I get over 500 emails a day.  I can thread them just like a news 
reader would do.  But I do sort them in different folders as well.  My 
most important folder contains emails directly sent to me, or on which 
I'm CC'd.  The other folders might get completely ignored when I'm too 
busy, or threads quickly purged out.

This is a mailing list and not a news group.  I don't care if you use a 
newsgroup gateway if it isn't broken.  As it is, gmane is broken as far 
as I'm concerned.

So please complain to gmane or change your setup.
