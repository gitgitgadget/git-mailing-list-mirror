This looks much cleaner to me.

I suspect we can do the same thing with the mime headers below there.
They end up in extra_headers, which is shown via after_subject. But we
could mostly replace after_subject with a call to fmt_output_email_mime()
or similar.

The only other use of extra_headers seems to be the static to/cc fields
one can add via format-patch. But those _should_ be treated differently,
as they can be allocated once in the rev_info, not per-commit. Which I
think shows off another bug. If you have a large to/cc list, that all
gets lumped into the same 1024-byte buffer, and may cause truncation.

I think the diffopt.stat_sep thing could get similar handling, too. It
appears to be set only in this one spot, and gets looked at in exactly
one. That could be replaced with an on-the-fly function call.

It sounds like the bitfield was the cause, so that should be an easy
fix. The other question is whether it makes "--format=email" any slower.
It shouldn't, as your new approach doesn't do any extra per-commit
allocations (and in fact, it avoids some useless buffer-copying).

I couldn't measure any difference.
