The patches are attached.
Further some questions:

-see the explanations of the branch command, ca. line 280: wouldn't it
be better to use other words than 'references'?
-sentence "it shows all commits reachable from the parent commit": it
seems wrong to me. The last commit is also shown.
- chapter "Browsing revisions": it seems counterintuitive to me to have
two different logics for the meaning of "branch1..branch2" and
"branch1...branch2", according to whether it's the argument of `git log'
or `git diff'
-section "Check whether two branches point at the same history": 'git
diff origin..master' -> shouldn't it be rather 'git diff
branch1..branch2'? â€¦ or rewrite the example with branch1=origin and
branch2=master.

greetings,
kalle
