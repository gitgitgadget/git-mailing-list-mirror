I refrained from commenting on that patch until now, but alas, you force 
me to.

I was pretty unimpressed by the additions, as they seemed large in volume, 
but small in content.

Remember, those who read "git for CVS users" are _unwilling_ to spend the 
time reading git documentation (at least for the most part).  If they 
encounter something which is not useful to them, they will not just ignore 
it, they will stop reading.

Ciao,
Dscho
