Hello list.
I'm going to publish my work into online public repository.
I have several months of previous history in my local git repo. And I
don't want to make it all public.
Is it possible to publish just a shallow copy of my repository storing
my current tree?
I'd also like to keep my local history private but push new commits
from it into that online repo.

Gennady

P.S. please reply to my email directly as I'm not signed up to mail list yet.
