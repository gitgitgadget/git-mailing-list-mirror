Yep, so it's doubly silly.

No, I meant that by using xmalloc() here, if the allocation fails, we'll
immediately die(). Whereas the caller of mmap() could get the ENOMEM
error, then unmap an in-use pack window and try again.

However, I forgot that we don't actually do that (yet). We unmap windows
if we go over our own packed_git_window_size counter, but not when mmap
fails. Eric posted a patch recently to change that, though (at which
point the die() in xmalloc() would be working against us).

(Actually, we did _try_ to do something like that in xmmap prior to
9827d4c185, but I don't think it actually worked since it was based on
our own internal limit, and not what the OS would allow).

Yeah, I think failing on a 0-length mmap is OK, since that's what real
systems do (and this is a wrapper). Our xmmap_gently() handles this,
which is the right spot.

I don't think of GIT_ALLOC_LIMIT as something we're committed to
publicly supporting, though I have (ab)used it once or twice myself.
However, I'm not sure if it makes sense here. True, on a system without
mmap it is a heap allocation, but to me it's conceptually very different
than a normal allocation (and on a system with mmap, we have no problem
at all requesting arbitrarily large maps). If we did want to put a limit
here, I think we'd want to do it at the xmmap layer, using a separate
variable.
