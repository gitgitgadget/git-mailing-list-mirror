Heh :-). Left overs from an earlier version of this series. I think that
I already talked about why this was changed further up in the thread.

I suppose, although (like you) I can't imagine why anybody would want to
do that.

I think so. My thought here was to leave this documentation as-is until
this patch, when adding '--input=none' would... somehow change this, but
trying to construct a reply, I can't seem to come up with why I thought
that this was a good idea in the first place ;-).

I reworded this slightly to not use "specified", which I agree is indeed
weird.

Fixed, and thanks for noticing.
