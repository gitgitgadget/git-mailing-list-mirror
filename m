Actually I'd like the editor integration to be broken out (if
it isn't already) so we can see which editors (and thus which
integrations) are popular among users.  I think it would help all
of the integration authors, as well as make it clear to end-users
where we have integration available/under development, in case they
were not aware of it previously.
