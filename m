The problem isn't on the applying end, but rather on the generating end.
The From header in the attached mbox is:

  From: =?us-ascii?B?PT9VVEYtOD9xP1NpbW9uPTIwU2FuZHN0cj1DMz1CNm0/PQ==?= <simon@nikanor.nu>

If you de-base64 that, you get:

  =?UTF-8?q?Simon=20Sandstr=C3=B6m?=

So something double-encoded it before it got to your mbox.
