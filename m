In case we want it, this is also:

I agree with Ã†var that we probably should keep an empty variable as the
empty string. I think some options use an empty string to clear a list
(e.g., push.pushOption), and I'm not sure how they'd react to a bool
instead. It would be nice to also have a way to do the implicit-bool
thing, but I don't think it's strictly necessary (it's always correct to
put the string "true" into the variable instead).

I think we should also document that <envvar> can't contain an "=" sign.
Of course using strrchr() here doesn't help much with just this patch,
because we flatten the string before stuffing it into
$GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS, so the reading side would mis-parse it.

But here's a fix for that. I built it on top of your whole series, since
you touched some of the related functions, but it could easily be
rebased onto just this part.

  [1/3]: quote: make sq_dequote_step() a public function
  [2/3]: config: parse more robust format in GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS
  [3/3]: config: store "git -c" variables using more robust format
