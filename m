I agree with both of you.  My understanding of Dscho's original
comment was that people weren't saying *what* specifically their
wish-list was, which means we have no hope as a community of meeting
their requests.

Carl and Andy both had submitted a long list of very specific issues
that they had with Git.  The result of those lists being posted was
a number of people contributed improvements that lead us to 1.5.
Nobody can argue with that.

But just saying "MY GOD FIX THE UI" is not a wishlist item (yes,
that was a real survey answer).  It provides the community no
chance to understand what parts of the UI we need to work on, and
what parts the end-user is OK with or just hasn't even tried to use.
