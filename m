Hi Joshua,

Thanks for saying this, it takes courage to face failure.

That being said, the code base is very close to the point where it can
be used to assess the success of the protocol design.  So while the GSoC
project is officially failed, I don't think we have to let the community
down.  Let's see if we can finish off the remaining bits and pieces and
put together such a report soon.

Cheers!
Sam.
