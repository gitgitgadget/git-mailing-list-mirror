This rendition of =E1=BF=A5=CE=BF=CE=B4=CE=BF=CE=B4=E1=BD=B1=CE=BA=CF=84=
=CF=85=CE=BB=CE=BF=CF=82 =E1=BC=A8=E1=BD=BD=CF=82 is an adjectivized ve=
rb construct,
like well-hung, good-natured, forward-looking, thinly-veiled (the
latter can be written as two words, too, however).

Nope.  It was used in "a last-resort method", namely in the
adjectivized meaning.  Without the hyphen, it would become the last of
some resort methods, quite something different (and nonsensical).
