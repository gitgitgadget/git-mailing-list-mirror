I had tunnel-vision and was thinking about this only in the context of
the tests. However, while I agree that spewing errors during
completion is not ideal, aren't there two different classes of errors
to consider? Some errors can crop up via normal usage of Git commands
in Real World situations; those errors should be suppressed since they
are expected and can be tolerated. However, the second class of error
(such as passing a bogus option to this internal function) is an
outright programming mistake by a maintainer of the completion script
itself, and it would be helpful to let the programmer know as early as
possible about the mistake.

Or, are there backward-compatibility or other concerns which would
make emitting error messages undesirable even for outright programmer
mistakes?
