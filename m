You can do something similar with 'git for-each-ref', which is probably
what you should be using if you are scripting, anyway (as it is
"plumbing" and guaranteed not to change in future releases). Something
like:

  FORMAT=3D'%(refname:short)
  %(taggerdate)
  %(subject)'
  git for-each-ref --format=3D"$FORMAT" refs/tags/

If you want to do more complex things, try the "--shell" option (or
--perl, --python, etc), which makes it easy to write little scriptlets
in your format, like:

  FORMAT=3D'
    REF=3D%(refname:short)
    TDATE=3D%(taggerdate)
    CDATE=3D%(committerdate)
    if test -z "$TDATE"; then
      echo "$REF: unannotated tag, commit date is $CDATE"
    else
      echo "$REF: annotated tag, tag date is $TDATE"
    fi
  '
  git for-each-ref --shell --format=3D"$FORMAT" refs/tags/ | sh

See "git help for-each-ref" for more discussion and examples.
