I wondered for a second what the value of old.commit would be in the
error case. But it should be NULL due to the memset above.

But what happens after that? Is everybody OK with NULL? I briefly poked
through the callees (merge_working_tree, update_refs_for_switch, and
post_checkout_hook) and they all seem to explicitly handle the NULL.
So I think this is good (well, clearly your change was an improvement
either way, but I feel more confident now that there is nothing else to
be fixed on top of it).
