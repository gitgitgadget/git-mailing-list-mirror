That could be a default, but please in that case add an override option. 
I can't even begin to list the number of fail whales that have been 
committed in the name of "security" without some kind of No Dammit I 
Really Mean Itâ„¢ override. Everything from MTAs refusing to deliver to 
shared mailboxes for role accounts (due to giving group access) to being 
unable to connect to old embedded devices because "SSL 3 is dangerous 
and deprecated" -- which, of course, is true, but when you are on an 
isolated network and can't downgrade the existing device to unencrypted 
and can't upgrade it to TLS, it is an amazing headache.
