Heya,

A very important part of Summer of Code is interacting with the
community. Not just by sending your code to the list regularly so that
everybody can see what you up to, but also by participating in the
discussion on the mailing list, asking questions, and voice your
thoughts on the project. I just checked to make sure, and I haven't
seen any mails from you on the git list yet, not even so much as an
introduction! This makes me sad, cos I think your project is _really_
awesome, and I would love to hear more about it, how it's going, and
what you are up to in general.

Cheers,

Sverre Rabbelier
