  Hello,

  I would like to ask about the status of the project to export the
linux-2.6 history from BitKeeper to GIT repository; it looked very
hopeful about a week or two ago, but got covered in silence soon.
Did Larry come upon you? ;-)

  I kept having people asking about this, so I would like to know.

  Thanks,
