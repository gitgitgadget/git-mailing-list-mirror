There might be a simpler change to solve the git-svn-HEAD issue. But I
was about to independently bring up the issue that I wanted to hide
away the "remote-tracking" branches.

I currently get a lot of noise in "git branch" output that are
remote-tracking branches that I will never commit to. (I use a -origin
suffix to help me filter them out, but I'd prefer not to see them at
all here.)

Meanwhile, as I've been teaching new git users, I've had to carefully
teach:

1) Never commit to a branch name that appears on the right side of ':'
   in a Pull: refspec.

2) BTW, that ':' might be only implicit. A refspec of "branch" is
   equivalent to "branch:branch" so don't commit to those either.

That's pretty painful, so I really think these remote-tracking refs
belong outside of refs/heads.
