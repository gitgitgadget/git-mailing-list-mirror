I read this forum using
http://post.gmane.org/post.php?group=gmane.comp.version-control.git
and it sort of works. Except that finding own old posting is quite impossible, 
even when I try searching for the subject, and/or author, and/or pieces of text 
in any combination. It finds some posting, but it misses others, whatever I do. 
Except that I don't know how to attach a file. Except that I'd expect to see a 
thread containing a new reply somewhere on the first page instead of on the 
14th. Except that replies to emails I get (answers to my threads) goes to their 
author instead of to the forum.

Is there a better way for using this forum/mailing list? However, I'd like to 
avoid getting daily dozens of emails.
