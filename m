Is your repository configured to (1) highlight whitespace errors in diff 
output and (2) to leave CRLF alone in text files?

If so, then it is just a side-effect of this combination, an illusion, 
so to say: The CR in the CRLF combo is trailing whitespace. The 'git 
diff' marks it by inserting an escape sequence to switch the color 
before ^M and another escape sequence to reset to color after ^M. This 
breaks the CRLF combination apart, so that the pager does not process it 
as a combined CRLF sequence; it displays the lone CR as ^M.

It is easy to achieve the opposite effect, i.e., that ^M is not 
displayed. For example with these lines in .git/info/attributes or 
.gitattributes:

*.cpp 
whitespace=trailing-space,cr-at-eol,indent-with-non-tab,space-before-tab
*.h whitespace=trailing-space,cr-at-eol,indent-with-non-tab,space-before-tab

Note the cr-at-eol. (There may be shorter versions to achieve a similar 
effect.)
