Wouldn't we call such a thing "git-reportbug", or "git gitbug", with
reference to Debian reportbug or perl's perlbug?

Addressing the more general issue, if we're concerned with 3rd party
tools usurping the core namespace trying to convince individual authors
of 3rd party tools to change the names of those tools to something more
unique is pissing in the wind.

That's never going to make a dent in the vast amount of git-whatever
tools, most of which won't be discussed as ideas on this mailing list
before they're released.

I think we basically have these options:

1) Accept the status quo where people do create third party tools, much
   of which are way too obscure to matter (e.g. I'm sure someone's
   created a tool/alias called range-diff before, but we didn't
   care).

   If those tools become popular enough in the wild they get own that
   namespace, e.g. we're not going to ship a "git-annex" or "git-lfs"
   ourselves implementing some unrelated features (re parallel on-list
   discussion; "git annex" could also be a "git commit --amend" alias).

2) #1, but hope we catch new tools early enough to convince their
   authors to change the names.

3) Make some structural change to git where only things we ourselves
   compile get to be called as "git <whatever>", and you'd need to call
   e.g. "git-bug" as "git ext::bug" or something. We'd need to have a
   large hardcoded list of older tools (lfs, annex, ...) to grandfather
   in if we went for this approach.

I think we should just go for #1, and if we're concerned about #1 not
being OK we really need something like #3, because #2 isn't going to
work.
