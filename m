No, I don't think you overreacted. Well, maybe a _little_ bit. ;)

I think you're focused on making git good (as in reliable and
maintainable), and that strong focus is admirable.

Your clarification on the expected developer profile, and how to target
the code to those developers helps, too.

For those of us who've spent years living in Perl, the idioms come much
easier than those who are coming from other languages like C. But if
the expected maintainers are not perl weenies (like me, I guess), then
you're right, it's better to stay away from the more perl-y stuffy.

Again, thanks.
