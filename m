Also, you would have the same problem with tooling around specific Git
hosting site as there is with tooling around specific email client.
Tool that works with GitHub (like submitGit) won't work with Bitbucket
or GitLab.

Well, unless such tooling was built in in all hosting sites.  They have
support for sending mails anyway, isn't it?

But perhaps the problem is current lack of tooling in the opposite direction,
namely getting patches from mailing list and applying them to GitHub repo,
or Bitbucket, or GitLab.  Though with working Git, it is something easier
than sending patches via email; it is enough that email client can save
email to a file (or better, whole sub-thread to file or files).

Also, there is lack of tools that convert inline (in-diff) comments on
GitHub (or Bitbucket, or GitLab) to email with review...


There is also distrust for centralized solutions (email is, in principle,
decentralized).  See projects like https://solid.mit.edu, etc.

It would be nice to have links to those tools in SubmittingPatches and/or
the Git homepage.

Well, "What's cooking ..." and 'pu' branch helps, I think.
