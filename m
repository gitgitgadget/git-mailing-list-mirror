Unrelated directly to above, I noticed that I actually showed up on the list for 2018 based on git log anyway. Does this mean I'd be welcome? Personally, it's actually easier to get approval to travel to Brussels now than SFO even though the latter is closer. With that in mind, I can do either (or both - depending on scheduling).
