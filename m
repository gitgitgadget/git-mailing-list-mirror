> Doing the due diligence, I actually read the man page on the platform before asking the question, which listed the following as the only allowed encodings: ascii, iso8859, latin1, latin9, dos, IBM-1047, koi8-r, next, utf-8, windows. The utf-8 variant does not know how to display its multi-byte forms in SJIS, as with other platforms. Does that make sense now?

Does the said man page also mention LESSCHARDEF or LESSOPEN?
