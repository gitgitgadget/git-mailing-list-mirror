Opps s/closed/close :D , i didn't mean closed vs open etc.
Close means physically close or atleast on the same lan/intranet.

Currently it has no such features as i am concentrating on getting the

in future i plan to add collaboration facilities like auto
push/pull/rebase to central branch,
auto remote branch management etc.
