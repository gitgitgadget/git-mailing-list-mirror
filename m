Hello Lars ! I'm actually in holidays, but I will try to send a new
version by the end of the week, it's nearly done. The code has been
refactored with what Matthieu and Remi told, so don't bother to read
the last version.

However, in the last version, if we want to deny an website,
including all schemes, we can blacklist the url without the
scheme. For example, "pushBlacklist = github.com". By doing so, this
remote is not an url anymore, and it can't be differenced with a local
relative path. It's a problem because these two have a different
treatement. The choice we made to solve this is to force the user to
put the scheme "file://" before any local relative path. What do you
think ?

Antoine
