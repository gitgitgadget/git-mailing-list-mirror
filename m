To be honest, I didn't really think that deeply about it. I had a hammer
in my hand, and LSAN kept showing me nails to pound.

I agree that these two strbufs should probably be treated the same.

In general, I think I prefer using UNLEAK() because it's hard to get it
wrong (i.e., you don't have to care about double-frees or uninitialized
pointers). For strbufs, though, that's less of an issue because they are
always maintained in a consistent state.

As an aside, I'm pretty sure that "err" can never have been allocated
here, and this release is always a noop. It's filled in only when we get
an error from the ref update, which also causes us to die(). But in
general I'd prefer the code that causes readers to think the least
(i.e., just calling free or UNLEAK here rather than forcing the reader
to figure out whether it's possible to leak).
