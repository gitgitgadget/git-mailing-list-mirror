The process is used by some teams, like OpenSSL, for WIP pull requests. It follows a git rebase --autosquash -i. The principle is to clean up the PR down to a single final commit for approval. It is more work for the contributor, but the committers seem to prefer having everything in one commit. This requires a git push -f.
