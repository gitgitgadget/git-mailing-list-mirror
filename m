In Git for Windows, we ran with a patch "in production" for quite a while
where paths starting with a slash (i.e. looking like Unix paths, not like
Windows paths) were interpreted as being relative to the runtime prefix,
when expanded via expand_user_path().

This was sent to the Git mailing list as a discussion starter, and it was
pointed out that this is neither portable nor unambiguous.

After the dust settled, I thought about the presented ideas for a while
(quite a while...), and ended up with the following: any path starting with
<RUNTIME-PREFIX>/ is expanded. This is ambiguous because it could be a valid
path. But then, it is unlikely, and if someone really wants to specify such
a path, it is easy to slap a ./ in front and they're done.

Changes since v1:

 * Included a test for the RUNTIME_PREFIX that I had meant to send for ages
   already, and based on which...
 * A test case was added to verify that this actually works as intended
 * It is no longer Windows-specific
 * I added some documentation

     -    mingw: handle absolute paths in expand_user_path()
     +    expand_user_path(): support specifying paths relative to the runtime prefix
      
     -    On Windows, an absolute POSIX path needs to be turned into a Windows
     -    one.
     +    Ever since Git learned to detect its install location at runtime, there
     +    was the slightly awkward problem that it was impossible to specify paths
     +    relative to said location.
     +
     +    For example, if a version of Git was shipped with custom SSL
     +    certificates to use, there was no portable way to specify
     +    `http.sslCAInfo`.
     +
     +    In Git for Windows, the problem was "solved" for years by interpreting
     +    paths starting with a slash as relative to the runtime prefix.
     +
     +    However, this is not correct: such paths _are_ legal on Windows, and
     +    they are interpreted as absolute paths in the same drive as the current
     +    directory.
     +
     +    After a lengthy discussion, and a way lengthier time to mull over the
     +    problem and its best solution, we decided to introduce support for the
     +    magic sequence `<RUNTIME-PREFIX>/`. If a path starts with this, the
     +    remainder is interpreted as relative to the detected runtime prefix.
     +
     +    This solves the problem, but what new problems does it stir up? Here are
     +    the two most obvious ones:
     +
     +    - What if Git was not compiled with support for a runtime prefix?
     +
     +      In that case, we will simply use the compiled-in hard-coded prefix.
     +
     +    - What if a user _wants_ to specify a path starting with the magic
     +      sequence?
     +
     +      In that case, the user will simply need to prefix the magic sequence
     +      with `./` and voil√†, the path won't be expanded.

     ++executable itself lives. If Git was compiled without runtime prefix
     ++support, the compiled-in prefix will be subsituted instead. In the

     ++_not_ be expanded, it needs to be prefixed by `./`, like so:
     ++`./<RUNTIME-PREFIX>/bin`.
