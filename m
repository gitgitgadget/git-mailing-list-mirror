The icon looks very similar to the one in GitWeb. The simplified is, without,
making a bitwise compare, is seems identical to the Git icon. Is that 
appropriate? What do the author of that icon, and other Git developers, think?

The plugin. after all, does steal ideas and repository format from Git,
but is in fact a completely separate implementation. 

I'll leave this one in my patch tree for now. The Egit icon contest is stil open to all.
