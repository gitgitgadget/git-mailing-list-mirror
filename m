Yes, perhaps. One could even argue that "git tag foo" is OK to page and
somebody would consider it a regression not to respect pager.tag. It
seems useless to me, but at least it's not totally broken like "git tag
-a foo" is.

But I find it pretty unlikely, as it doesn't produce copious output. I'd
worry more about eventually finding a command with two copious-output
modes, and somebody wants to distinguish between them. If we can't come
up with a plausible example now, I'm inclined to deal with it if and
when it ever comes up. Right now I just don't want to paint ourselves
into a corner, and I think we can always add more config later (e.g.,
tag.pageFooCommand=true or something; that's not great, but I'm mostly
betting that it will never come up).

Thanks. I was the original proponent of "pager.tag.list", and only after
reading your series today did I think "gee, this seems unnecessarily
complex". So it's entirely possible I'm missing a corner case that you
may uncover through discussion or experimenting.

I think the rules would be:

  1. If --paginate is given, do that. Likewise for --no-pager.

  2. Otherwise, respect tag.pager.enable if it is set.

  3. Otherwise, use the built-in default.

  4. Any time the pager is run, respect tag.pager.command if it is set.

And then there are two optional bits:

  2a. If tag.pager is set to a boolean, behave as if tag.pager.enable is
      set to the same boolean. If it's set to a string, behave as if
      tag.pager.enable is set to "true", and tag.pager.command is set to
      the string. That should give us backwards compatibility.

  2b. If tag.pager.command is set but tag.pager.enable isn't, possibly we
      should assume that tag.pager.enable is set to "true". That makes
      the common case of "page and use this command" a single config
      block instead of two. It matters less for "tag" where paging would
      be the default.

So I think that what you asked above, but to be clear on the final
question: --paginate should always be "must be used". And that meshes
nicely with implementing it via the git.c wrapper, where it takes
precedence way before we ever hit the setup_auto_pager() call.
