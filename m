Ok, to wrap up an (imho) unnecessary discussion:

planetgit.org was announced on this ML a while back, a few people 
replied, I wrote the webmaster and had my blog added (but noone else 
seems to have done so). It's a shame should the domain and already setup 
planet go to waste.

I'd suggest for the webmaster to simply start adding git-related blogs 
until someone complains ;). Or at least start adding the sites which are 
purely devoted to git, and not the personal blogs with a git-category. 
People will only start adding their blog if they see some content 
already there I suppose, while others simply are too lazy to write the 
webmaster or dont see the point.

If someone strongly strongly objects simply adding weblogs please let me 
know, but I think it might be worth a try to bring the planet to life ;)

Greetings,
Jojo
