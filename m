Ardison Brooke & Partners'

On behalf of the Administrator and Executor of the estate of Late Engr. Kruger Kroger . I once again try to notify you as my earlier letter were returned undelivered. I wish to inform you that late Engr. Kruger Kroger  made you a beneficiary to his WILL. He left (11%) of the total sum of Thirty Million, One Hundred Thousand Dollars (USD$30, 100.000.00) to you in the Codicil and last testament to his WILL.

This may sound strange and unbelievable to you, but no doubt it is a life reality and true. Being a widely traveled man, he must have been in contact with you in the past or simply you were nominated to him by one of his numerous friends abroad who wished you well and good future.
Engr. Kruger Kroger until his death was a member of the Helicopter Society and the Institute of Electronic & Electrical Engineers. Please if I reach you as I am hopeful, endeavor to get back to me as soon as possible to enable me conclude my job. For more details contact this Email: barrabrooke@ymail.com

Yours in Service,
BARR. ARDISON BROOKE ESQ.
