Yes, indeed. I think that there is a balance here: I'm thrilled that you
are choosing to spend your time working on and improving the
changed-path Bloom filter implementation.

Of course, it couldn't have hurt to have these ideas earlier when the
list was more focused on reviewing Garima's original patches. But,
nothing is set in stone, and it seems like there are some re-usable
ideas and clean-ups below.

I'll respond to the patch descriptions below with a "cut-line" where I
think we could extract and apply what's already there before putting the
rest aside to be worked on more.

Yes, obviously this needs to be addressed, but I certainly don't fault
you for posting what you have (thanks for adding the 'PoC' prefix to
indicate it as such).

I originally thought that this would be a non-starter, but it may not
be. GitHub doesn't write Bloom filters at all (yet), but one
consideration of ours is to only generate Bloom filters when we roll-up
all of the split graphs.

Our invocation during this bigger repository maintenance is something
like:

  $ git commit-graph write --reachable --split=replace

But if it turns out to be expensive to run 'git commit-graph write
--split=no-merge --stdin-commits --write --changed-paths' on every push,
we might just run the above with '--changed-paths'.

I can imagine other schemes where it would be desirable to have your
Bloom filter implementation over split graphs, in which case this should
be addressed. But, I don't have a problem with a version that only works
for non-split graphs first, so long as there isn't a compatibility
boundary between that and a version that does work for split graphs.

I think you're right to draw the "laying the ground work" line here.
Could these first fourteen patches be applied cleanly to master? They
all look mostly like improvements to me, especially the second patch.

The next twenty patches look like they need some more work. At a
high-level, I think we need to do the following things, in roughly the
following order:

  - Prove that this is a strict performance improvement on the existing
    Bloom filter implementation.

  - Sketch out a way that it would work for cases where '--split' is
    provided, and/or '--reachable' isn't provided.

  - Clean up the existing patches, adding tests which exercise the new
    functionality, and prove that there aren't regressions against the
    existing Bloom filter implementation.

  - Review and repeat.

I guess I'm left wondering whether or not this is something that you
want to continue, given that I outlined a pretty lengthy path for
getting this in a suitable shape to keep going.

Are you planning on keeping working on this?

Thanks,
Taylor
