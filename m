Yep. I actually started to write xmemdupz() originally then decided it
was unnecessarily verbose and a premature optimization.

I wondered after this exchange whether something like:

  char *strbuf_dup(const struct strbuf *sb)
  {
	return xmemdupz(sb->buf, sb->len);
  }

would be a useful general helper. Grepping around it doesn't seem like
there are a lot of candidates.

If we really wanted to micro-optimize, we could have cmd_hist store
strbufs, and then we could reuse the same buffers over and over without
re-allocating. And use strbuf_addbuf(&cmd_hist.buf, &command_buf). :)
