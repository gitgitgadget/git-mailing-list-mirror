as one of the people featured in the "peace love and paychecks" article, 
i found the reporting to be surprisingly accurate (ie it could have been 
much much worse).  i often tell people who ask me "what do you do" to 
read a copy of it.  i haven't read any of his other pieces, though, so i 
can't really comment on bias or accuracy over the body of his work.
