The patch will work as intended and as expected for 95% of the users out
there (javadoc, Doxygen, kerneldoc, etc. all have the comment
immediately preceding the function) and fixes a very real problem for me
(and I expect many others) _today_; for the remaining 5% (who put a
blank line between their comment and the start of the function) it will
revert back to the current behaviour, so there should be no regression
for them.

For the 0% who don't put even a single blank line between their
functions, it will probably not work as expected, but then again I have
never seen such a coding style in any language, so I am doubtful if this
is something that needs to be taken into account in the first place.

Adding a regex instead of the simple "blank line" test doesn't seem very
difficult to do, but I am doubtful that it will make any difference in
practice. But that can be done incrementally as well by the people who
would actually need it (who I strongly suspect do not exist in the first
place).

I don't like specifying a fixed number, that negates almost all the
reason for using -W in the first place; I would much prefer adding
a config variable to control the -W behaviour (or a new diff flag).
