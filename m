Yeah, I looked at the surrounding code and agree that this is the right
thing to do.

I wondered if it might make  sense for the initialization and clearing
of this "archive_args" structure to go in a pair of matched functions,
but it probably isn't worth the trouble. write_archive() is the only
place where we will allocate and deallocate such a struct (the only
reason it is a type at all is to pass the set of values around the
stack).
