I'll also point out that being a 'productive member of society' may have a 
wider definition then you may think initially.

is a sysadmin who never contribures a line of code, but switches hundreds 
of servers to linux and assists friends in migrating to Linux a productive 
member? he doesn't contribute any code, so some people would say no, but 
in spreading the use he is increasing the number of potential contributers 
so others would say yes.

keep this in mind before you assume that someone isn't worth anything.
