So far yes.
Potentially, not yet tested, "git bisect" could be affected. That would 
also be a problem.
And yes, when rebase failed, cherry pick would also fail.


I did not see a "force" option for either of them, to ignore a dirty 
worktree.

I had a series of errors. Some of the errors, are indeed that I can not 
continue after resolving conflicts, because I can not clean the worktree.
(I guess I could set up a .git/info/gitattribute to mark the files as 
binary, and remove it again after the rebase. But that is not a 
desirable solution)


As a once off I also got an
    error: add_cacheinfo failed
One branch really could not be rebase by any means. But it was a single 
commit, so I copied the files.



I did "git replace" now for lots of those files.
But some commits had "modified files" that appear to have the correct 
line ending in the repro (git add --renormalize did not add changes to 
be committed / the file is added, but commit says 0 lines changed, and 
the issue remains).
So for those I have no way to get rid of yet.

Those none-line ending issues existed already before I started to git 
replace.
I did not replace commits, but only the blobs for the file in question 
(had to find several such blobs, per commit series)
