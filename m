I made it through a very careful read of all of the actual code changes,
through patch 14. After that, it looks like it's all tests, but my brain
is now effectively fried. I had some comments, but nothing
earth-shattering.

I'll pick up on 15-24 later, though I think between my comments and
Ã†var's there's some light changes to be made. So don't hesitate to post
a new version in the meantime, which can save us a round-trip.
