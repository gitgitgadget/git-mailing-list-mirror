If we are storing a pack with index-pack, the on-disk size will match
exactly this input size. If we unpack it to loose, then big files don't
tend to have deltas or to compress with zlib, but that is not always the
case. I have definitely seen people try to store gigantic text files.

If your goal is introduce a user-facing object-size limit, then I think
the "logical" size of the uncompressed object is the only thing that
makes sense. Everything else is subject to change, and can be gamed in
weird ways.

If your goal is to avoid malicious pushers causing you to allocate too
much memory, then you might want to have some limits on the compressed
sizes you'll deal with, especially for deltas. But I don't think the
checks here do that, because I can send a small delta that reconstructs
a much larger object (which we'd eventually reconstruct in order to
compute its sha1).
