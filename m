  Hi,

Dear diary, on Thu, Jul 27, 2006 at 10:39:55PM CEST, I got a letter
where Johannes Schindelin <Johannes.Schindelin@gmx.de> said that...

  now that's a pretty strong statement - did a lawyer tell you that?
(Lawyer in what country? Germany?) Because copyrights are generally
retained over translations, otherwise I could freely publish
e.g. Czech translation of someone else's English book without any
permissions and such, which is obviously not the case.

  There has been actually similar issue with OpenTTD - it was created by
translating Transport Tycoon Deluxe assembly to C without permission of
original TTD copyright owner (not that anyone actually knows for sure
who that is, after series of company mergers and buyouts). I don't think
anyone consulted a lawyer about legality of that either but I believe
that most people agree that this is basically illegal (but most likely,
noone will ever sue, or care at all).
