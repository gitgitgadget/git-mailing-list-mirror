Current index does not support empty trees. But users can construct
empty trees directly using plumbing. When empty trees are checked out,
things become inconsistent:

 - If cache-tree somehow is invalidated, when a tree is read to index,
   empty trees disappear. When we write trees back, empty trees will
   be gone.

 - If cache-tree is generated by read-tree and remains valid by the
   time trees are written back, empty trees remain.

Let's do it in a consistent way, always disregard empty trees in
index. If users choose to create empty trees their own way, they
should not use index at all.

 That's probably because of cache-tree. Empty trees can't exist in
 index so an operation "trees -> index -> trees" will remove empty
 trees.

 But read-tree can preserve the exact structure of original trees
 (including empty trees) so if that particular path is untouched,
 empty trees will remain.

 Perhaps a patch like this for pre-1.8.0?
