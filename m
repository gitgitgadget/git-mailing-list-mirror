5 links in the middle?  You mean to the project links?  I just choose
the biggest, most well known projects I could think of and stuck them
up there - many of them are at GitHub.  If you have a list you like
better, I would be happy to add them, or discuss the final list, but I
hardly think that's an advertisement for GitHub.  As for the link in
the footer, that's where I'm hosting my repo for the page, and it's at
the bottom of the page and tiny.

I am more concerned about the logo at the bottom, and Petr and I are
discussing this - I can remove the logo, but then I'd have to pay for
this out of my pocket instead of having a small logo on the page.
It's not bad to host a few webpages, but this will eventually have
diagrams and screencasts and whatever else I can do for comprehensive
documentation, which can add up in brandwidth costs (especially the
screencasts).  The Githubbers have offered to pay for that and host
media and whatnot for the project, backed by a real team of sysadmins.
 That seems like a pretty good deal for a small logo at the bottom of
the page.  For newbies, that is likely even a good thing - makes them
see that there is some corporate interest in it - that it's not just
an obscure tool for the hard core.

I am open to discussion on that, but I can't change where Ruby on
Rails has decided to host their repo.
