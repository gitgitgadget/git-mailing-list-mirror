I'm fine with this patch, but FWIW I think reporting the result of
strbuf_read_file with error_errno() would actually be an improvement.
The errno values are generally sufficient to tell if the problem was in
opening or reading, and then we'd get more information in the case of a
failed read() call.

Thought note...

If we were to use error_errno() in the second conditional here, we
should take care not to clobber errno during the close(). I think
strbuf_read_file() actually has the same problem, which might be worth
fixing.
