Registration is now open for the Contributor Summit at Git Merge. To
recap from my earlier announcement[1]:

  When: Thursday, January 31, 2019. 10am-5pm.
  Where: The Egg[2], Brussels, Belgium
  What: Round-table discussion about Git
  Who: All contributors to Git or related projects in the Git ecosystem
       are invited; if you're not sure if you qualify, please ask!

Registering for the contributor summit requires a special code. Please
email me off-list to get one.

As with past years, the code will unlock a ticket for both the contrib
summit _and_ the main conference (on Friday, Feb 1st). So don't register
separately for the main conference. Also, as in past years, there are
two variants: a free ticket, and a â‚¬99 one. You are free to use either;
if you choose to pay, the money goes entirely to the Software Freedom
Conservancy.

If you'd like to come but need financial assistance with travel costs,
please reach out to the Git PLC at git@sfconservancy.org. And please do
so soon (let's say by Dec 13th), so we can make decisions and people can
book their travel.
