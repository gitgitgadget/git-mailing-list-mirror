And it certainly helps to explain user-visible differences between
Bazaar-NG and GIT; I'd like to put ComparisonWithBazaarNG page on
GitWiki (http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/) some time soon, in addition
to ComparisonWithMercurial I meant to add from some time (stemming
from discussion on #revctrl list on FreeNode), and in addition
to existing GitSvnComparison page on GitWiki).
