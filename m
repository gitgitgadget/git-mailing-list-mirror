Thanks for a detailed report. Your analysis all makes sense to me.

I don't think we've heard of such a problem before with Git. I don't
know enough about GOAWAY to comment on the correct behavior, but this is
almost certainly a curl issue, not a Git one. All of the connection
handling, reuse, etc, is happening invisibly at the curl layer.

It's probably worth poking around libcurl's issue tracker. This seems
like it might be related:

  https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/11859

And one final comment: 2000 is a lot of requests for one clone. That
plus the error you are seeing from Git makes me think you're using the
"dumb" http protocol (i.e., your webserver is not set up to run the
server side of Git's smart protocol, so it is just serving files
blindly).

I don't know if using it is intentional or not. But the smart protocol
is much more efficient, and in general I would expect it to have fewer
corner cases (none of the major forges allow dumb-http at all).

You can find more details on setting it up in "git help http-backend".

If you do want to keep using the dumb protocol, consider running "git
gc" on the server side repository. 2000 requests implies you have many
loose objects, which could be served much more efficiently as a single
pack.
