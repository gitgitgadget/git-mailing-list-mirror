Not so sure I like this idea. For me, mails are *extremely* asynchronous.
I started already over a decode ago to switch off automatic mail checking,
as it interfered with my productivity.

And for me, one of the main benefits of a standup is the chiming in from
unexpected sides. That's very much a real-time thing, and I don't know how
to achieve that otherwise.

But for our standup, I could imagine that even so much as shifting it from
Friday to any other weekday would decrease the timezone issues (because,
you know, weekend).

Ciao,
Dscho
