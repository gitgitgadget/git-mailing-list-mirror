Hi, 
I would like to start contributing to git and am looking for a small project
idea to get started with. On the  Small Project Ideas wiki
<https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/SmallProjectsIdeas>   site there is a
suggestion for adding a 'git rebase --status' command that sounds like it
would be good for someone who has little knowledge of the code base. Is this
project still wanted? Aside from that, I've done a little searching and
haven't been able to find an official bug tracker for git is there somewhere
I can find some bugs to help fix?
Apologies if this isn't the correct place to be posting.
Thanks
Adam Fraser
