This looks correct (and is a good direction, as it drops a leak).

The original code is actually a bit confusing/unsafe, as we set the
"found" flag early and rollback here:

and that leaves the "out" filehandle dangling. It's correct because of
the later "do we still have the lock" check:

> -	if (lock) {
> +	if (is_lock_file_locked(&lock)) {
>  		fprintf_or_die(out, "%s\n", reference);

but the two spots must remain in sync. If I were writing it from scratch
I might have bumped "found" to the scope of the whole function, and then
replaced this final "do we still have the lock" with:

  if (found)
	rollback_lock_file(&lock);
  else {
	fprintf_or_die(out, "%s\n", reference);
	if (commit_lock_file(&lock))
	...etc...
  }

I don't know if it's worth changing now or not.
