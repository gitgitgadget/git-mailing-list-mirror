Yes, we could do that, though I think it loses most of the value of the
test. We can check that if we hit an arbitrary value we generate the pax
header, but I think what we _really_ care about is: did we generate an
output that somebody else's tar implementation can handle.

And for the smaller-than-64GB case, GNU tar happily handles our existing
output (though I suspect other tars might fail at "only" 8GB).

Yeah, you're right (and for the one in the next patch, too).

Thanks for noticing that. I remembered wondering that when I was early
in debugging/diagnosing, but forgot to follow up on it. I agree it's
unlikely in practice, but we should have consistent checks (I think it
would actually make sense to move the ISREG check inside ustar_size, and
then we can apply it consistently here and when generating the header;
my goal with ustar_size() was to avoid having the same logic in multiple
places).
