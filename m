That's Mr Hamano (one 'm'), and personally, I think that only when you 
have contributed to this project yourself, would you have a leg to stand 
on when you criticise him.

As an observer, I think that Junio is doing a superb job of managing the 
sometimes quite torrential flow of patches contributed to git. As Linus 
himself has often said (Paraphrased, of course):

The role of the maintainer is often more to *reject* patches than to 
accept them, so as to maintain the quality of the code base.

Having said that, the amount of *constructive* criticism that 
accompanies those rejections is amazing. Often I have seen multiple 
pages of response to a 2 line patch, so that the contributor (and other 
observers) can better understand the reason for the rejection, and how 
to construct a better patch that would be accepted.

Rogan
