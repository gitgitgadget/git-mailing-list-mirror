The reason missing includes are ignored is that the way this is expected
to be used is e.g.:

    [include]
        path ~/.gitconfig.work

Where .gitconfig.work is some configuration you're going to drop into
place on your $dayjob servers, but not on your personal machine, even
though you sync the same ~/.gitconfig everywhere.

A lot of people who use includes rely on this, but I see from this
thread this should be better documented.

If we were to make nonexisting files an error, we'd need something like
an extension of the includeIf syntax added in 3efd0bedc6 ("config: add
conditional include", 2017-03-01) 3efd0bedc6 ("config: add conditional
include", 2017-03-01). I.e.:

    [includeIfcond "test -e ~/.gitconfig.work"]
        path = ~/.gitconfig.work

Or something like that, this is getting increasingly harder to shove
into the *.ini config syntax.
