Yeah. In retrospect, it probably would have been saner to make %C(red) a
noop when --color is not in effect (either because of --no-color, or
more likely when --color=auto is in effect and stdout is not a
terminal). But that ship has long since sailed, I think.

If we do a revamp of the pretty-formats to bring them more in line with
ref-filter (e.g., something like "%(color:red)") maybe that would be an
opportunity to make minor adjustments. Though, hmm, it looks like
for-each-ref already knows "%(color:red)", and it's unconditional.
<sigh> So perhaps we would need to go through some deprecation period or
other transition.

I like the intent here, though I found "Values, color" hard to parse (it
was not immediately clear that you mean "the color paragraph of the
Values section", as commas are already being used in that sentence for
the parenthetical phrase).

I'm not sure how to say that succinctly, as we are four levels deep
(git-config -> configuration file -> values -> color). Too bad there is
no good link syntax for it. Maybe:

  ...color specification, as described in linkgit:git-config[1] (see the
  paragraph on colors in the "Values" section, under "CONFIGURATION
  FILE")

or something.
