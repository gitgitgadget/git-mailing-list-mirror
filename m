Hi there,
as few of you might know, there existed a very nice mc/norton commander
orientated tool called git
      Homepage:    http://www.gnu.org/software/git/
      Description: GNU Interactive Tools - increase speed and
efficiency of most daily task

This package have been in existence since many summers, but the name choice for
git - the stupid content tracker, seems to cause several weird problems when
you don't want/expect it :(

Could the name git perhaps be reconsideredto something like SCT? or GnuSCT?

Just asking, as it do cause hassles when an environment is using git
and suddenly
need to load git to download newer drivers etc. and then git isn't
working because the wrong git is in the right place :(

Thanx
