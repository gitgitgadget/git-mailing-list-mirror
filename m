I briefly tried to get rid of the pool. I _think_ it should be possible,
but I did see some test failures. It's entirely possible I screwed it
up. However, I did generate a few interesting measurements showing how
the current hash table behaves on this test:

  git init repo
  cd repo
  perl -e '
      my $bits = shift;
      my $nr = 2**$bits;

      for (my $i = 0; $i < $nr; $i++) {
              print "blob\n";
              print "data 4\n";
              print pack("N", $i);
      }
  ' "$@" | git fast-import

Here are wall-clock timings for the current tip of master, versus with
the patch below applied:

nr_objects   master       patch
2^20         0m04.317s    0m5.109s
2^21         0m10.204s    0m9.702s
2^22         0m27.159s    0m17.911s
2^23         1m19.038s    0m35.080s
2^24         4m18.766s    1m10.233s

The curve on master is quadratic-ish (each line has double the number of
objects of the previous one; the times don't multiply by 4, but that's
because the hash table is only part of the work we're doing). With my
patch, it's pretty linear.

But I'm still disappointed that the smallest case is actually _slower_
with the patch. The existing hash table is so simple I can imagine using
khash has a little overhead. But I'm surprised it would be so much (or
that the existing hash table does OK at 2^20; it only has 2^16 buckets).

Maybe this email will nerd-snipe RenÃ© into poking at it.

The patch I tested is below (it's slightly different than what I showed
before, in that it handles duplicate insertions). Maybe using hashmap.c
would be better?
