Is it worth adding a perf test that's heavy on abbreviations?

Sounds reasonable. The code itself looks good, with one minor nit below.

Thanks for adding this comment.

Now that this is becoming public, I think we need to document what
should be in "path" here. It is the complete path, including the 2-hex
subdir.

That's redundant with "subdir_nr". Should we push that logic down into
the function, and basically do:

  if (subdir_nr < 0 || subdir_nr > 256)
	BUG("object subdir number out of range");
  orig_len = path->len;
  strbuf_addf(path, "/%02x", subdir_nr);
  baselen = path->len;

  ...

  strbuf_setlen(path, orig_len);

That's one less thing for the caller to worry about, and it's easy to
explain the argument as "the path to the object directory root".

I think the trailing slash here is superfluous. If you take my
suggestion above, that line goes away. But then the front slash it adds
becomes superfluous. It should probably just do:

  strbuf_complete(path, '/');
  strbuf_addf(path, "%02x", subdir_nr);
