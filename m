FWIW that was the intention, but luckily Junio quickly predicted it was
most likely buggy and so has been since made obsolete by:

as I said originally, I thought it would had been even better to be specific
up to the line number of the instruction that failed, after all we already
have the whole function code for context in the message.

I couldn't figure out why that was needed, but while I am just slow, this
one is actually genius!; you are using a shell parameter expansion (which
is even POSIX sh compatible) to do string concatenation!

conditionally, noneless and not even using a silly if (like I would have
done) or a bash += concatenation operator.

fair enough; but in my defense, I couldn't had been made aware this was
being used also for debugging, or called without the parameter or even
called in a way where it will report its own LINENO (which you clearly
explained before as being the wrong value to report and that lead to
my confused first attempt at porting it)

thanks again, for your insightful feedback, and guess then there is no
more point on trying to simplify it further, and if you could ACK my
other proposal, hopefully neither a need to find workarounds to running
tests on NetBSD for the current master.

if we decide later into improving the accuracy of the report, might be
worth documenting some of what I learned in the commit message, for the
future reviewers, who hopefully will be less thick headed.

PS. I know I botched the v2 git send-email, so you didn't get a CC, or even
    have the v2 in the subject, hope it would be still good enough but let
    me know otherwise.
