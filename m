If you can tell me how to make Outlook insert >'s in front of a block of
text, I'm all ears.  I can't find any kind of "quote content" or "paste
as quotation" on the menus, or any option to do anything with the
original message other than to put it at the end with ---original
message--- in front of it.  This was the best I could figure out that
was useful, and gets replies threaded (mostly) properly.  While you're
at it, how do you tell Outlook to always start a message in "plain text"
(not HTML) based on the target address, like Thunderbird does?

Alternatively, tell me how to reply using the Gmane web viewer, or point
me to another web-based viewer that shows current content.

Or, the mailing list server could translate Outlook's visible
interspersed quotes (the original message is blue, new typing is black)
with a uniform quote style that is specified in each subscriber's
preference settings.

Could be worse.  Ever use Lotus Notes?

This is offtopic, but *PLEASE* notice that nobody else quotes like this
around here.  I find the style of quoting makes it unnecessarily harder
to
skip over parts that others wrote (and I've already read---so I do not
want to waste my time on re-reading them) to get to what you are adding
to
the discussion quickly, and extremely annoying.  It is the reason why I
am
skipping many of your replies to other people without reading to the
end,
even when I suspect you might be saying something worth reading.
