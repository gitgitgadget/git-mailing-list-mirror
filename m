My opinion is that it is good to give developers who could come an
idea of what the Git project should at least be able and willing to
fund, because most developers might have no idea about that.

For example many developers who contributed say less than 50 patches
to Git may think that they have no chance of being payed back anything
which might not be true at all. And by the way to make that clear, it
would be nice if the Git project could say for example every few weeks
how many people have asked for something.

I don't think there is a perfect way to do this kind of thing, but I
think being more transparent and upfront while still taking care of
privacy issues and leaving some room for discussion, can only help.

I must say that it is quite different, because in case of my spare
bedroom I am the only one who decides according to my own priorities.
For example if too many people ask to be accommodated and one of them
helped me personally in the past, I will be much more likely to chose
him regardless of his importance for the Git project.

First the rules are not so hardly set, especially because they say "at
least this amount", so in case of doubt there is room for paying back
more to more people than initially planned.

And anyway in the "case-by-case as needed basis", you still have the
problem to decide how much to pay back each one, in case people ask
for more than what is available. In this case it could be seen as very
unfair that rules are defined or negociated on the fly. (Though I
agree that in the past it went very well, but then I think it can only
improve things to have some rules defined at the beginning.)
