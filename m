The same "what do you want them all for" question could be asked of
git-clone which also fetches all available branches. I really just
want to be able to easily watch what's going on in multiple
repositories.

I want to be able to just say "git update" (or whatever) and then be
able to list and browse and explore the stuff locally.

Yes, there's still outside communication that's necessary, but with
the ability to easily track all the remote branches that communication
can be even less formal if I can easily browse and explore things
locally. For example, I might not even know the name of the branch:

Me: Have you pushed a branch for your new work on the frob-widget?
Friend: Yes

And then I can "get fetch" and see "cool-new-frob" come in without
having to be told that name. Or I could have even just fetched
without the specific communication if I was already expecting it for
some reason.
