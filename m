Hey all,

I'm going to be working with a small dev shop in the near future and
we would like to use Git for our project.  Two of us are on Macs, but
the other is on Windows.  I know the options are MSysGit or Git
through cygwin.  I'm curious which is better to use and if MSysGit is
even stable yet.  Does anyone have experience running Git on Windows?
Any experiences you can share?  Is MSysGit ready yet or should we
wait?

Thanks all!
Joe
