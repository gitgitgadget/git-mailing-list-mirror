Yes, I still did not do the cleanup I promised, so sorry for that :-(

BTW, if you are interested about the decision what is the OpenOffice.org's 
next SCM going to be:

http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/ESC_minutes#SCM_review

The short version is that OOo wants to go the DSCM way, but the engineering 
steering committee did not get other numbers than git and svn ones, so 
temporarily they decided to migrate to svn, and later to a chosen DSCM (to be 
chosen from bzr, git, hg).

So - most probably I'll again ask you for help with tuning the git repo 
again :-)

Regards,
Jan
