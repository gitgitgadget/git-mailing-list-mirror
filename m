Hmm, I guess most names that would qualify are already taken
(most of them by squatters, though). So someone
would have to pay money for this...
(And I guess something like git-scm.org wouldn't qualify as more
"official", would it?)

However, I have to admit I had quite some problems remembering the
domain name myself in the beginning...

There are use-cases for shared repositories. Maybe this is one of them?
