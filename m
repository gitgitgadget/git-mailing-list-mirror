Hi Jakub,

OK, I'll look deeper into the mailer issues. Any comments on the  
actual code in the patch, and the question regarding git-log vs git- 
cat-file?

Speaking of which -- is there any particular reason for not running  
git-log once, instead of forking it (or git-cat-file) for every commit  
in the log? There seems to be a special case for merges, but it'd  
appear to be more efficient to query the SQLite DB for the commits  
provided by git-log rather than the other way around, no?

Any thoughts?

(git-send-email appears to fail for me without providing an error.)

Many thanks,
Fredrik
