Thanks, I think this is the thing to do (and the code change looks
obviously correct ;) ).

This may cause a user-visible behavior change even in overlay mode
(because we'll now match some tree entries that we wouldn't before). But
I think it's an improvement, because it makes:

  git checkout <tree> -- <paths>

consistent with:

  git checkout -- <paths>

I don't know if you want to call that out more directly in the commit
message.
