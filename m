The decision is actually pretty straight-forward: if version < 1, ignore
extensions, otherwise respect them (and complain about any we don't know
about).

So I think we could just do in verify_repository_format() something
like:

  if (version < 1) {
    /* "undo" any extensions we might have parsed */
    data->precious_objects = 0;
    FREE_AND_NULL(data->partial_clone);
    data->worktree_config = 0;
    data->hash_algo = GIT_HASH_SHA1;
  } else {
    /* complain about unknown extension; we already do this! */
  }

It's a little ugly to have to know about all the extensions here, but we
already initialize them in read_repository_format(). We could probably
factor that out into a shared function.
