It's been like 2 days and we're already overflowing.  I've also
already heard people say they didn't sign up because it was full.
This is unacceptable.  I want to drink with all of you guys.

Shawn, if you can't get a bigger venue at Google, we'll rent a meeting
space either at the hotel that most of the mentors are staying at or a
nearby one.  I'm looking into spaces that will accomodate closer to 50
people and will serve us beer. :)

So, everybody that wants to come just sign up and we'll make sure
there is room for everyone.  Also, if any regular Git contributors
need help with flights or lodging, please let me know and we'll see
what we can do to help.

Thanks,
Scott
