Point 1.

I do not have an interest in cataloguing past conflicts I and others
have had with you; the list archive has done so. I have already made my
comments there, and I see no point in starting a new argument.

I never claimed that you contribute nothing. But every minute spent
arguing with you is a minute that could be spent on something more
productive. It is certainly possible that community members reading your
emails could be a net negative for the users, if it leaves them no time
for other code.
