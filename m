| During this time all back-end services, including wiki's, ssh and
| userweb to name a few things.
|
| The hardware portion of the upgrade should be complete within an hour,

| complications, I will kick another e-mail off with updates.
|
| If you have any questions, comments or concerns please don't hesitate to
| get ahold of me.
