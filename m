IANAL but AFAIK even if the code is quite different by now, if you
_started_ with bzrk code the copyright of the original author is still
lurking inside your code - it's basically a continuous series of
directly derived works.

OTOH, what am I not getting? The bzrk's license seems to be GPLv2, our
license seems to be GPLv2, ...
