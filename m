We hit this "if" if !relevant_commit(p), which I think is what we want.
But we'd also hit it if !revs->simplify_history. Would we want to avoid
doing the simplification in that case?

I guess later we do:

...which blocks the !simplify_history case from triggering. But then we
could avoid the allocation above in that case, I think (though I agree
with Kevin's later email that we may not need it at all).

Do we even need to do the parent rewriting here? By definition those
parents aren't interesting, and we're TREESAME to whatever is in
treesame_parents. So conceptually it seems like we just need a flag "I
found a treesame parent", but we only convert that into a TREESAME flag
if there are no relevant parents.

I wouldn't be surprised, though, if some code path really cares whether
we've simplified to a single uninteresting parent here, versus
simplifying to a root commit (I admit that the simplification code is
one of the areas of Git I'm least familiar with).
