IMHO such a mixed use is mildly crazy. At any rate, we would know that
anybody using appendf() would not have this problem, since we are just
introducing it now.

I do agree that argv_array is generally a better fit for most cases.
Didn't we want to rename it to strarray or something? That's probably
too much yak-shaving for this series, though. :)

This is the first time I think that's been suggested, but I agree it's
the only sensible thing for the functions to return.

Yup, this looks good to me.
