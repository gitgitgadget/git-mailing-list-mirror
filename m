(To anyone interested, there's a cross-post to the main Git list which
Vitaly failed to mention: [1]. I think it could spark some interesting
discussion.)

As to the essence of the question, I think you blame GVFS for no real
reason. While Microsoft is being Microsoft â€” their implementation of
GVFS is written in .NET and *requires* Windows 10 (this one is beyond
me), it's based on an open protocol [2] which basically assumes the
presence of a RESTful HTTP endpoint at the "Git server side" and
apparently designed to work well with the repository format the current
stock Git uses which makes it implementable on both sides by anyone
interested.

The second hint I have is that the idea of fetching data lazily
is being circulated among the Git developers for some time already, and
something is really being done in this venue so you could check and see
what's there [3, 4] and maybe trial it and help out those who works on this
stuff.
