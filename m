First off, thank you for the example script. It made understanding
what's going on so much easier. :)

I think the presence of common_submodule in the main repo is actually a
red herring. if you remove the last two lines of this stanza:

> git setup main_repos
> pushd main_repos
> git submodule add ../common_submodule
> git commit -m 'added submodule to main_repos'

the outcome is the same.

It looks like "fetch" is smart enough to initialize a submodule when
necessary, but not smart enough to do so recursively. If I replace that
line with:

  git submodule update --init --recursive

then it works as I'd expect. Likewise, cloning the repository with:

  git clone --recurse-submodules main_repos foo

does what you'd want.

After that, I think "git fetch --recurse-submodules" does what you want,
because the submodule repository is already initialized.

I'm not sure to what degree git-fetch intended to support initializing
submodules. But it certainly seems like a bug that it handles the top
layer but does not recurse (i.e., it should either handle all or none).

Hopefully the commands above at least give you a workaround.
