My general feeling is that having multiple push URLs for a remote is a
poorly designed feature in Git (and I think the discussion elsewhere in
this thread went there, as well).

But since we do have it, and if we are not going to deprecate it[1], it
seems like this case should pick the X value of myremote/mybranch ahead
of time, and then use it consistently for each push. There are questions
of partial push failures, etc, but as you note the current behavior
isn't ever useful. I think it just a case where two features do not
interact well (and since neither is used all that frequently, nobody has
noticed).

[1] I would not be at all sad to see multiple URLs like this get
    deprecated in favor of multiple remotes with convenient grouping
    options. If that happens, then your original problem goes away. ;)
