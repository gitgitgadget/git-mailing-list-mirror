I vaguely recall some discussion of this in the past, so maybe it isn't
a good idea. But I would think changing git-archive to respect
.gitattributes might be worth doing (presumably the version of
.gitattributes from the tree that is being exported).

I think you understand what is going on. A clarification to both pages
would be helpful, I think, just saying "here is why you might use one
over the other."

I'm not sure what you mean here. Very few commands talk to remote
repositories. I had assumed in your git-archive example that you wanted
.gitattributes on the remote repo to affect the tarfile generated by
that repo. But now it sounds like you want to edit a local file to
impact the archive generated remotely. I don't think there is a way to
do that.
