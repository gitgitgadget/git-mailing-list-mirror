Hi,

I am inquiring about whether you may be interested in linking to our site https://www.mathschase.com/ from your page?

https://porter.io/github.com/akanshgulati/commit-semantics

Maths Chase is a completely free site where you can quickly test your times tables. The site is a very simple game but I think kids will find it a really fun way to learn their times tables. I wondering whether this could be a useful resource for your site readers?

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Kind Regards,
Sarah
