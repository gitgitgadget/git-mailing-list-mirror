Hi, I think --recreate-merges is a very exciting feature.

I've also been puzzled by why we can't just pick merge commits directly
including
conflict resolutions, so allow me to join the discussion.

I think I understand. Evil merges happen when we change the branch
that is not the mainline..? Is there any reason why the following
wouldn't work?

Imagine rebase is about to pick a merge commit, and we have edited at
least one
commit in each branch to be merged.

1. apply patch mainline_orig..merge_orig
2. apply patch branch1_orig..branch1
...
N. apply patch branchN_orig..branchN
N+1. Commit merge

I do see complications, like the fact that steps 2-N can be done in any
order, with
possibly quite different results. Moving commits from one branch to
another might
not work very well. And what to do when you remove branches or create
new ones?

These problems might be prohibitive, but picking merge commits seems
like
something that should be possible to do.

I want this as well :). I don't quite see the risk if it's not used
with --interactive.

FWIW I'd be totally fine with disallowing it in --interactive. It would
be incredibly useful 
e.g. with pull --rebase in merge-based workflows.

BTW what is the difference between --recreate-merges and --preserve-
merges when
--interactive is not present? I apologize if you have explained this
somewhere
else in the patch series.
