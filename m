That GET function is:

  GET() {
        curl --include "$HTTPD_URL/$SMART/repo.git/$1" >out 2>/dev/null &&
        tr '\015' Q <out |
        sed '
                s/Q$//
                1q
        ' >act &&
        echo "HTTP/1.1 $2" >exp &&
        test_cmp exp act
  }

The tarball you sent shows "out" as empty, and "act" is missing. So
"curl" produced no output, and we did not make it as far as the tr/sed
pipe. Just a guess, but are you missing the "curl" command-line tool on
your system? If so, "apt install curl" should fix the failure.

As far as code changes in Git, perhaps (assuming my guess is right):

  - drop the redirect of stderr here; the test suite already handles
    hiding stderr from the user (without "-v"), and in "-v" mode you
    probably would have gotten a useful error like "curl: not found"

  - it's rare but possible to have libcurl installed (which is needed
    for the server side, and what we key on for running the httpd tests)
    but not the curl binary. This test probably should check for the
    existence of the curl binary as a prerequisite.
