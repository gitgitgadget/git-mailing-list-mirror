The review on that thread is basically "do we want to add every
abbreviation under the sun, or do we want to come up with a better
placeholder scheme?". And that has come up several other times (e.g.,
Ted's recent %gt placeholder).

I _do_ think that's the right way forward, but as nobody has been
pushing it that way, and these things come up from time to time, maybe
we should just accept it and add the ones people want in the interim.
It's not like it makes the situation significantly worse, or harder to
migrate to %(authordate:short).
