I'm OK with that.

Since the breakage was technically attributable to my commit (I say
technically because flushing out these kinds of bugs was exactly the
point of it), I feel slightly guilty that I might have broken somebody's
oddball workflow. So I tend to err on the side of restoring the original
behavior in that case, even if I can't conceive of it as being
particularly useful. :)

But if nobody is actually in support of it, and given that it has
already been broken for 2 years, I certainly do not mind waiting to see
if anybody screams.
