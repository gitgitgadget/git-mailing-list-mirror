Interestingly, that was slower for me (2m47s wall-clock, with 27m of
CPU). Using "2" is slightly faster than "1". But "3" is a little less
fast, and "4" is slower than "1". So...no clue what is going on.

Yeah, I've had various issues with the packaging. For a long time they
had 1.0.7 in experimental, but with no python support. I wonder if it's
worth starting to use python scriptlets in our coccinelle rules, as
described in 4d168e742a (coccinelle: use <...> for function exclusion,
2018-08-28). They're faster and IMHO easier to understand.

Of course I tried it out and got some inscrutable errors:

Fun.
