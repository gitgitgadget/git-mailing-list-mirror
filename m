This series introduces a few new FAQ entries on various topics.

Changes from v1:
* Fix typos in commit messages.
* Talk about case-insensitive file names, not files, to avoid ambiguity.
* Warn people about rebases.
* Switch from "long-running" to "long-lived" and explain the situation
  more clearly without relying on people understanding the meaning of
  the adjective.
