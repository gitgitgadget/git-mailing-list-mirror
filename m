The first is not legal; we insist that symrefs start with "refs/".  The
second one _is_ legal, but isn't any kind of loop. The HEAD symref is
.git/HEAD, which is distinct from a ref of the same name inside
refs/heads/.

It's confusing, of course, because the lookup rules make it hard to
refer to refs/heads/HEAD. For that reason we do disallow it from the
branch-creation porcelains like git-branch and git-checkout.
