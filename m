Is this a real thing we're running into? I'd have thought that anybody
adding index-specific tracing would do it as GIT_TRACE_INDEX.  It's
unfortunate that "trace commands and processes" is just GIT_TRACE, and not
GIT_TRACE_RUN or similar. But that's mostly historical. I wouldn't
expect people to add other subsystems to it.

Not that I'm totally opposed to your patch, but it's a little sad that
we have to match the specific text used in GIT_TRACE now (and if they
ever changed we won't even notice, but rather the test will just become
a silent noop).

I think it would be nice if we could move towards something like:

  - move current GIT_TRACE messages to use GIT_TRACE_COMMAND or similar

  - abolish trace_printf() without a specific subsystem key

  - do one of:

    - keep GIT_TRACE as a historical synonym for GIT_TRACE_COMMAND; that
      keeps things working as they are now

    - have GIT_TRACE enable _all_ tracing; that's a change in behavior,
      but arguably a more useful thing to have going forward (e.g., when
      you're not sure which traces are even available)

And then a test like this would just use GIT_TRACE_COMMAND.

I had a vague recollection that we preferred "egrep" to "grep -E" due to
portability. But digging in the history, I could only find "fgrep" over
"grep -F". And we seem to have plenty of "grep -E" invocations already.
