Great!

Go for it ;-) The microprojects are basically a straight-forward way to
introduce prospective GSoC students to Git's code contribution process.

In that sense, while it would be better for students not to have
overlapping microprojects, it is not the end of the world, either.

In your case, it is relatively easy to figure out that no other student
mentioned this project on the Git mailing list:
https://public-inbox.org/git/?q=test_path_is_file

True. You could brush up that pair of patches to teach `git archive` to
avoid spawning `gzip` when generating `.tar.gz` archives, and submit them
using the process suggested in https://git-scm.com/docs/SubmittingPatches.

(You might want to make it easier on yourself and use GitGitGadget, which
takes out the challenge of sending patches in the required format via
email, see https://gitgitgadget.github.io/ for details.)

On the other hand, it might make more sense to start afresh with the
test_path_is_* microproject, as I already took custody of your patches and
planned on submitting them (via GitGitGadget) right after v2.21.0 comes
out.

This is a good first step, indeed. You may want to be careful about it,
though, as there *might* be instances where replacing the `test -f` would
not make sense (such as instances where scripts are written via
`write_script`, and those scripts would not have access to the
`test_path_is_file` function).

You probably also want to inspect instances of `test -e` (which
technically only ask whether a path exists, whether it is a file, a
directory, or a symbolic link), as it might be possible that some tests
use that invocation when they really want to ask whether a file exists.

Then, you want to also look for `test -d` for the `test_path_is_dir`
conversion.

Good luck,
Johannes
