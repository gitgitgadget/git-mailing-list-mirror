That is another hasty generalization...

... and that is pure hubris and arrogance. :-)

I do not dispute any of that.

This is where you are making the hasty generalization. Your facts do not =
suffice to prove this conclusion.=20

And even if the conclusion is true (which is possible despite your =
flawed argument, although I doubt it), then you are making another =
implicit assumption: Namely that people will automatically transfer the =
red/green principle from diffs and test results to logos.=20


Look, it's exactly this kind of non-sense pseudo-rationalization that =
leads big companies to follow what "market researchers" tell them they =
absolutely must do to make their customers happy, and then fail big with =
it because emotional stuff like that doesn't work with pure logic.

If you want to know what Git users think about the various logo =
variants, ask them *exactly that*. Indeed, that might be a helpful =
contribution.

But do not ask them something else, and then pretend you can deduce from =
that what they will think about the logo. And in particular, please stop =
claiming that you don't even have to ask them that, because you already =
supposedly know -- you somehow being representative of the majority of =
Git users, while everybody who disagrees with you automatically is in =
the minority. You can do that if you are e.g. leader of North Korea, but =
nobody here is buying that.
