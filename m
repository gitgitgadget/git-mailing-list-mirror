I'm not dismissing it, but your focus is on how to get this result. If the 
results were always the same, I wouldn't have a problem at all.
That's why I'm trying to give you an example where the end result differs, 
how are we supposed to get to an agreement on _how_ to get the result, if 
we don't even agree on _what_ the result should be?

What exact behaviour is that? That I dare to disagree with you?

If you knew me that well, you also knew that such threats don't work with 
me.
In this case you know perfectly well, that I don't know the code as well 
as you, so without any help it would require a huge waste of time with the 
risk of rejection.
