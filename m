I do not really care that much about this particular issue (and I
haven't even really use trace2 for anything yet). My main concern was
just painting ourselves into a corner, and making things explicit rather
than implicit helps with that (i.e., having the user give us a
placeholder that tells us what to do instead of selecting one of several
reasonable behaviors based on whether the path exists).
