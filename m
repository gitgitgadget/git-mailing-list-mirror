I like it.  Btw, would a bitfield enum be portable enough for us?

	enum git_hash_algo algo:8;  /* or algo:2 */

I've used those in other projects, but AFAIK they were for
gcc||clang-only.

Thanks for that info.  I'm not familiar enough with most git
internals to know if it ought to make a difference as-is.

In my experience, changes like this open the door to further
struct-packing opportunities (possibly combined with conditional
use of __attribute__((packed)) ).
