Hi,

I'd like to propose a kind of mini-google summer of code to the
students of the the school where I teach, i.e. Ensimag, France
( http://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/ ). In short, this means having a few
students working for Git for a month at no cost ;-).

Currently, the students have an end-of-year project (in equivalent of
master 1) with the choice between many subjects, some of them being
somehow "real-life" (i.e. actually usefull things), and other being
artificial (i.e. enjoy doing it, and throw it away afterwards).

This year, I'd like to propose a subject "contribution to an existing
free software", and since the one I know best currently is Git, this
would take the form of "contribution to the Git project". I'd see the
practical organization a bit like the google summer of code: chose a
feature (the GSoC proposals on the wiki can be a good source of
inspiration), and implement it with the goal of being eventually
merged upstream. There would be no money involved, but the students
get a grade at the end. I would anyway follow the work of the
students, but a co-mentoring from a Git expert would be great.

The students work full-time for about 3 weeks (May 20th to June 16th),
and are grouped by teams of 2 to 4 students. Given my bandwidth, I
plan to propose only one group of 4 students this year, but we may
scale up later, who knows.

We have plenty of time before this starts, but I'm just sending this
email to get your feeling on it.

Any opinion? Do you like the idea?
