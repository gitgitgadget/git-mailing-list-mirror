Wow, that's very surprising.

Just to be clear, if you run:

foo() {
  for i in "$@"; do
    echo "arg:$i"
  done
  sed s/^/stdin:/
}
set -- outer
foo inner <<EOF
$1
EOF

do you get:

arg:inner
stdin:inner

? (on dash and bash, I get stdin:outer as expected). I don't think the
fact that check() uses eval() should matter, because we'd be
interpreting that here-doc earlier as part of read_chunk().

I don't mind more quoting, but...

...please don't invert the double and single quotes. In either case the
metacharacter is subject to double-quote expansion, and by putting
the double-quotes on the outside, you've left a trap for somebody adding
more lines to the test (the shell snippet will now be interpolated
before being eval'd, which is contrary to how most of our tests run).
