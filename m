I can reproduce easily here with the script below. It looks like a
regression in c9d961647 (i18n: add--interactive: mark edit_hunk_manually
message for translation, 2016-12-14), which is in v2.12.0. It taught the
script to write out with the comment char, but reading it back does not
seem to work.

Here's my reproduction script:

-- >8 --
rm -rf repo

git init repo
cd repo
git config core.commentchar '$'

seq 10 >file
git add file
git commit -m base
perl -pi -e 'print "new\n" if $. == 5' file
(echo e; echo n) | GIT_EDITOR=true git.compile add -p
# look for "corrupt patch" in the output
-- 8< --

I think there's another bug, too, where the "patch did not apply
cleanly" prompt goes into an infinite loop if it gets EOF.
