I suspect it is that fetch ignores SIGPIPE, but clone does not. So even
when we see a 141 exit code from fetch, it is probably generated
synthetically from exit(141) after we saw EPIPE. And your patch works
there because we have a chance to pump the read-side of the pipe,
whereas in git-clone we die immediately via the signal.

Probably git-clone should ignore SIGPIPE during the network transfer
portion of the process for the same reasons given in 143588949c (fetch:
ignore SIGPIPE during network operation, 2019-03-03).
