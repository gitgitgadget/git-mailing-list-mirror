I think that's more of an Asian response to the confusion westerners
have with "family name" vs "given name" and "first name" vs "last name".
The simple solution is to convert the "family" name to all upper case and
then whatever order is used is no longer ambiguous (assuming you know
the convention).

That, at least, is my conclusion from seeing Japanese business cards.

I could be totally wrong, of course.
