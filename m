There's some glob-matching code (somewhere? I don't know if it's allowed
everywhere) that allows "**" to mean "zero or one path components. If
"refs/tags" were massaged to be "refs/tags/**", then it would match not only

    refs/tags
    refs/tags/foo

but also

    refs/tags/foo/bar

, which is probably another thing that the user would expect to see.

There's at least some precedent for this kind of expansion: `git
for-each-ref refs/remotes` lists *all* references under that prefix,
even if they have multiple levels.
