Hi,

As can be seen on the GitTogether page on the wiki: 

http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/GitTogether

we may have the following speakers/topics:

* Shawn O. Pearce:
	- bundle related secret project,
	- JGit,
	- PackV4,

* Sam Vilain:
	- GitTorrent (current state, security considerations, future direction),
	- Git as a DB backend,

* Junio C Hamano:
	- TBD,

Some people are not yet decided and others have not yet be contacted. So the 
list of possible speakers may grow. By the way if you want to talk or 
introduce a discussion/workshop/haxession please contact us (Shawn and 
myself).

The topics suggested on the wiki are:

	- GitTorrent: current state, security considerations, future direction
	- Submodules: how to make a UI for this important feature that is intuitive 
and complete
	- PackV4
	- JGit, quo vadis1?
	- Using Git for everything but source (Git as a backup tool, how to handle 
large blobs, using as a DB back-end, etc)
	- How to make Git more attractive to the Google Code folks?
	- Success/War stories (big wanking session for Gits)
	- Linkable library for basic object access (libification or new library)
	- Git GUI that even a designer could use (GitCheetah, AKA TortoiseGit?)
	- Shawn's current bundle related secret project
	- TopGit introduction/design/integration(?)
	- Pasky's current pickaxe related "secret project" (if tangible by then)
	- New Git Homepage hammering-out
	- Extending Git with volatile metadata database (see 
20080910164045.GL10360@machine.or.cz)
	- Git Survey 2008 results and discussion
	- Free form "We tried to use git in our project this way, didn't work very 
well" session, where participants are not allowed to say "Your workflow is 
broken".

More topics/ideas are welcome.

Thanks,
Christian.
