Yeah, I agree it is safe now. I'm just worried about some function in
remote.c later doing:

   read_config();
   add_and_parse_fetch_refspec(remotes[0], whatever);

which leaves the struct in an inconsistent state (we realloc NULL which
allocates from scratch, and all of the other entries in remote->fetch
end up uninitialized).  Can we at least add an assertion like:

  if (!remote->fetch)
	BUG("cannot add refspec to an unparsed remote");

?
