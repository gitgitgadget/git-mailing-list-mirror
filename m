I think so too.  At that point we've already dumped the contents of the
$TEST_RESULTS_SAN_FILE file.

IMO, when $test_failure is zero (the "if" I'm touching), the message
makes sense not so much to say that a leak has been found, but rather
because we're forcing the non-zero exit.

But when $test_failure is not zero, after we've already dumped the
log, maybe this is somewhat redundant:

diff --git a/t/test-lib.sh b/t/test-lib.sh
index 87cfea9e9a..b160ae3f7a 100644
--- a/t/test-lib.sh
+++ b/t/test-lib.sh
@@ -1267,6 +1267,8 @@ check_test_results_san_file_ () {
        then
                say "With GIT_TEST_SANITIZE_LEAK_LOG=true our logs revealed a memory leak, exit non-zero!" &&
                invert_exit_code=t
+       else
+               say "With GIT_TEST_SANITIZE_LEAK_LOG=true our logs revealed a memory leak"
        fi
 }

However, if you or anyone else thinks it adds value, I have no objection
to re-roll with it.

Thank you for taking the time to review these series.
