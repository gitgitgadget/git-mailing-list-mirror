The two modes (dup/nodup) make string_list code tricky.  Not sure
how far we'd get with something simpler (e.g. an array of char pointers),
but having the caller do all string allocations would make the code
easier to analyze.

Right, we'd just have extra string copies in that case.

It's subtle, but I think it's not leaking, at least not in your example
case (and I can't think of another way).  IIUC format_subject(), which
handles the "%s" part, doesn't touch sb if the subject is made up only
of whitespace.
