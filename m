Good question.

Certainly "--" will work as it did before, since the code here only
changes behavior when it sees --end-of-options.

filter-branch doesn't use any of our parseopt infrastructure itself, so
it won't understand the new option itself. I.e., this won't work[1]:

  git filter-branch --end-of-options -this-is-a-branch-name

But since it passes rev-list options as-is, this does successfully pass
the name to rev-list:

  git filter-branch -- --end-of-options -this-is-a-branch-name

However, filter-branch itself seems to do some magic of its own with the
rev-list options, and will try to filter HEAD in that case. So I think
it needs further work to cover all cases correctly.

[1] I think the first one there would work if filter-branch actually
    used "rev-parse --parseopt". E.g.:

      git rev-parse --parseopt -- --foo --end-of-options --bar <<-\EOF
      cmd
      --
      foo    an option
      bar    another option
      EOF

    yields:

      set -- --foo -- '--bar'
