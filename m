I'd use a shallow clone with depth 1, like:

  git clone -b $your_branch --depth 1 $remote_url

Note that "--depth" implies --single-branch, so it will really just grab
that one branch (and if it's the remote's default branch that you want,
you can omit the "-b $your_branch" part).

If you find the shape of history useful (e.g., your CI wants to look at
just new commits), you might also find partial clones useful. Something
like:

  git clone --filter=blob:none $remote_url

will fetch all commits and trees, but only load blobs on-demand (so
basically whatever is needed to check out that tip commit). You can
pare it down further by switching to "--filter=tree:0", which will avoid
trees (but note that filling in trees when you need them is a bit more
expensive, since inherently you have to make a round-trip to the server
for each level of tree).
