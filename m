Hmm. That commit does touch "ci/" with respect to one of its parents.
It should get simplified away because it completely matches the other
parent, so it does sound like a bug.

Both of those directories also differ between one parent. If you try it
with "contrib/remote-helpers", which does not, then the commit does not
appear.

So it does seem like a bug where we should be simplifying away the merge
but are not (or I'm missing the corner case, too ;) ).

I keep some older builds around, and it does not reproduce with v1.6.6.3
(that's my usual goto for "old"). Bisecting turns up d0af663e42
(revision.c: Make --full-history consider more merges, 2013-05-16).  It
looks like an unintended change (the commit message claims that the
non-full-history case shouldn't be affected).
