Yes, it is sad.  Even if now 4 out of 855 current subscribers said 
something.

Why?  I see that we had many ideas, less student applications, and even 
less accepted.

So let's throw ideas out there!

Robin, how about it?

That would need a student who is already familiar with Git, though.  A Git 
newbie has no chance to learn everything necessary (including the style of 
the community) in 3 months _and_ finish the project.

Do go ahead!  I started the page

	http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/SoC2008Ideas

which is utterly incomplete.  I just took the ideas of 2007 that I am 
still interested in, and removed other people from the Mentor list, 
because I do not want to force them.  So please, if you are interested in 
mentoring one of the existing projects, just add yourself.

And of course add all those cool projects you have in mind.

Shawn, do we have to do the same again, as on this page?
