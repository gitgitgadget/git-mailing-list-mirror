This is worthless, unless you (a) actually make the poll, instead of =
claiming to know its outcome, and  (b) you establish that what people =
answer when asked about the colors red and green implies what they think =
about the git logo on git-scm.com rendered in either color...

If you really want to conduct a poll, though, I think it would be more =
useful if you e.g. asked people to order several logo candidates / =
variants by preference, and/or asked them what "feelings" each logo =
evokes with them, etc. -- i.e. ask them about actual logos, as opposed =
to asking about something else (like colors) and then extrapolating =
without a scientific basis.
