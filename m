git describe is driving my crazy sometimes, too - both the results and
the code ;)

[long read with lot's of debug output follows, sorry]

What is going on here is the following:
git describe --tags decides based on "depth".

git tag --merged dcc3ef3ee7 lists both emacs-25.1 and emac-25.2 (among
many others).

git rev-list --count emacs-25.1..dcc3ef3ee7
5126

git rev-list --count emacs-25.2..dcc3ef3ee7

4793

So, you would rightly expect 25.2 to be preferred over 25.1.

Now, "git describe" does not do a "rev-list --count" for each tag but,
instead, walks back from dcc3ef3ee7 and notes when it reaches a tagged
commit, and how many steps it takes to get there. The information
"reachable by the i-th tag that I encountered" is kept by a field of
width 27, which limits the --candidates values. Once the walk passes
more tags it is aborted.

Then the possible matches are sorted.

Then the depth calculation is finished.

Funny order of actions, isn't it? Smells like BUG.
At least it makes the debug output meaningless.

Here's the debug output before and after finish_depth_calculation():

Now, I can't claim that I can wrap my head around
finish_depth_calculation() and the way depth is calculated here, let
alone those huge numbers (probably per not-contained tag or so), but
that order of operations is clearly wrong.

Now, if we fix finish_depth_calculation() to actually do the work for
all possible candidates, and the sort afterwards, the result is:

emacs-24.5-rc3-fixed-13470-gdcc3ef3ee7

At least the latter kind of makes sense:
git rev-list --count emacs-24.5-rc3-fixed..dcc3ef3ee7
13470

In short, I think that depth calculation is heavily problematic. First,
commit_list_insert_by_date() influences which tags are considered at all.
Second, and worse, the code for "describe cmt" clearly tries to
calculate the number of commits in cmt that are not in t (for each
candidate t), which ought to be "rev-list --count t..cmt", but fails
spectacularly.

I kind of suspect the priming of the tag depth on first encounter
("t->depth = seen_commits - 1;") to be the culprit because that depends
on the way we walk, not the topology, but I wouldn't know how to do better.
