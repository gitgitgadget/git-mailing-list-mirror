He (and you) get "removed" when individuals who have decided the vast
majority of their e-mails shed more heat than light, and so people
decide that it's not worth reading their e-mails.  I have persionally
made this determination for both you and for Felipe; for you, your
participation in this thread was what set the "bozo bit".

Now, I'm not a major developer for git, so my personal decision
doesn't make a huge amount of difference.

But if people who *are* senior developers in the git community decide,
on their own, that someone isn't worth listening to, there's the
punishment has been inflicted, and this happens without banning
someone from posting or removing them from the mailing list.

Please stop.
