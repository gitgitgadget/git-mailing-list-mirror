Yeah, this is a definite improvement.

OPT_HIDDEN_BOOL() itself is a little funny to me. I guess back then we
did not have the "_F" variants, but really it is just:

  OPT_BOOL_F(0, "peel-tag", &peel_tag,
	     N_("dereference tags in the input (internal use)")),
	     PARSE_OPT_HIDDEN);

which would remove one more special case (after all, being hidden is
orthogonal to the type). But there are enough of them that maybe having
a special name for this is worth it. I dunno. But we could probably
simplify the definition, at least. :)
