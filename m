I've been hoping to look at this more in coming weeks/months.
It would be nice if bundles and packs could be unified somehow
to avoid doubling storage on the server.

Yes, but slow clients are still a problem since big responses
keeps memory-hungry processes running while trickling
(or waste disk space buffering the pack output up front)

Static packfiles/bundles are nice since all the clients can
share the same data on the server side as it's trickled out.

I enabled persistent connections for 404s on loose objects for
this reason :)  We should probably be doing it across the board
on 404s, just haven't gotten around to it...

Increasing default parallelism should also help; but might hurt
some servers which can't handle many connections...
Hard to imagine people using antiquated prefork servers for
slow clients in a post-Slowloris world, but maybe it happens?
