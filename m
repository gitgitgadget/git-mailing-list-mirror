As a Windows user, when I want to look at the Git user-manual, I tend to
`git help git`, which on Git for Windows opens the usersÂ  default
browser. For me, it's at C:/Program
Files/Git/mingw64/share/doc/git-doc/git.html.

I can then browse that directory to find user-manual.html and open it
from there (because I know it is there!).

How do Git on Linux users launch/read the user-manual?

Essentially the user manual isn't accessible from Git, and really it
should be.

However it's not a formatted as a man page so some other access
mechanism is needed, compatible with Linux, and Windows users. It would
be nice if it was part of the `git help -g` list.

Excuse my ignorance for not knowing how linux users should access this
usefully curated doc.
