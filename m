Well, gitosis even made me more confused :P

Let me reask:
I'm running git deamon under supervisor with:

/usr/lib/git-core/git-daemon --syslog --export-all --enable=receive-pack
--verbose --base-path=/home/apache/gitprojects

then i went to /home/apache/gitprojects and runned:

git init
git add .

but for example, CGIT web interface says:

--
Not a git repository: '/home/apache/gitprojects'
generated by cgit at 2009-12-27 21:54:47 (GMT)
--

what could i be missing here?
I've been reading howto's i find on the web, but all lead me to the same
point, what i did and non work.. (with me).

Jorge,
