Typically, that problem arises when you turn a filter on or off at some
point in your history. Since "attributes" can come from various sources,
especially the versioned ".gitattributes" file, unversioned per-repo
.git/info/attributes, and global attributes, "git diff" may apply
different attributes depending on what you diff (versioned blob, workdir
file, out-of-tree file).

This is not made easier by the fact that unversioned config (per repo,
per user, global) defines the filter action, and that even upgrades of
your filter tools may change the output. So, "filter off/on" is by no
means the only possible source of discrepancies.

I've found that when I decide to use a filter like that, the best
approach is to either apply it retroactively (filter-branch,
unversionsed attributes, that is clean all stored blobs) or make a
commit where I specifically note the switch (versioned .gitattributes
plus affected blob changes) and what config should go along with it.

All of this is difficult to check or correct automatically, since it
depends on user decisions.

About the only thing we could do is checking that
"clean(smudge(foo))=clean(foo)" at a specific "point in time"
(attributes, config) for specific foo, but that wouldn't catch the case
above, even if we iterated over all commits which affect files that the
filter (currently) applies to.

Keep in mind that filters are a killer feature, so if you shoot yourself
in the foot: it could have come worse ;)
