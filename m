I don't have strong opinion about this.  I guess following the example
of pkt-line format description may be a good idea.  We are not writing
an RFC here... but having be explicit is better than be good read :-P

Better.

I wonder if it is a matter of current implementation, namely that at
the point of code where Git is sending capabilities it doesn't know
which of them it will be using; at least in some of cases.

Because if it would be possible for Git to not send capabilities which
it supports, but is sure that it would not be using for a given operation,
then it would be good to do that.  It might be that filter driver must
do some prep work for each of capabilities, so skipping some of prep
would make git faster.  Though all this is for now theoretical musings...
it might be an argument for such description of protocol so it does
not prevent Git from sending only supported capabilities it needs.

It wouldn't kill you to summarize the argument, would it?

From what I understand the argument is that "<capability>=true" allows
for simplist parsing into a [intermediate] hash, while the other
proposal of using"capability=<capability>" would require something more
sophisticated.  And that it is better to be explicit rather than
use synonyms / shortcuts for "<capability>".

Though one can argue that "<foo>" is synonym / shortcut for "<foo>=true";
it would not complicate parsing much.

Nb. we don't use trick of 'parse metadata to hash' in neither example,
nor filter driver used in test...

Is this still true?

Ah.  So without some way to tell long-lived filter process that
it can shut down, because no further data will be incoming, or
killing it by Git, it would hang indefinitely?

All right.  Not that we need keep-alive packet for communication
between two processes on the same host.

Though I wonder why this rule is here...

[...]

Anyway it would be better to have helper subroutine to get metadata
lines (packets till flush) and parse them into array or a hash...

>>> +

...and the latter would make ignoring order of lines simpler.

Though I wonder if we can ensure in the protocol documentation
that those lines would always be send in this order.
