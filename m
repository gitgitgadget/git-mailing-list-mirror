FWIW, I like it. I like both the better font and whitespace layout and
the 3-color-spot-merge-to-white. As Petr says, we have had the
(apologies, but to me) ugly logo for a while, so it is widely used,
and perhaps it has even grown on people.

BazaarNG managed to grab the best concept logo of the lot, IMHO, with
the 'merge' roadsign.

Can we separate the 2 things? The better fonts and layout look like a win to me.

WRT the logo, the current one is not a particularly strong image, and
we haven't spent millions in plastering it over magazines or anything.
So a good new logo would be something to take on.

cheers,
