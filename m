Both Eclipse and NetBeans are getting on board with JGit and trying
to make viable plugins from it.  So hopefully by the next survey
this particular question will have been answered for a decent
precentage of our IDE toting users.

Actually, I'm rather excited by what's going on in the Git IDE
space these days.  The NetBeans plugin is seeing more activity,
and since GSoC so has EGit.  Both projects have been steadily
picking up contributors.  Quite a good thing.
