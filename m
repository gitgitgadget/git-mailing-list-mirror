I'll re-test without "};", my (seemingly incorrect) quick read of your
E-Mail + my own testing was that semicolons were fine there, but maybe
they're just accepted by most...

FWIW that's just the GCC Farm which is fairly easy to get access to for
free software devlopment: https://cfarm.tetaneutral.net/machines/list/

The HP/UX box is a similar "private" setup mainly for Perl5 core
development, I'm getting to use it to get git working there.

*nod*, will test with some version of that.
