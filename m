No, my plan was to off-load work from Shawn, who is obviously overworked.

And I only nominated you because you write _so_ long mails that I expected 
you to have spare time and Git motivation to do the job. (In fact, your 
mails are so long, and so many, that I simply cannot read them all.)

Shawn, being the guy he is, was not able to say "no". But I'd rather do 
the admin job myself than seeing him getting even more overworked. Because 
I would hate to see Shawn burn out: his work, in my opinion, has been the 
most valuable for Git in general _by far_ during the last years.

So if Shawn is as overworked as I expect, and you chicken out due too 
becoming father, I will take the job.

Ciao,
Dscho
