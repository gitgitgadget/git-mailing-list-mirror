One thing to consider is that sequencer.c will be used by all sorts of 
different builtins, which are each implementing instructions given 
differently by the user. Just because a message makes sense as output from 
revert.c doesn't mean it will make sense from (for example) bisect*.

This makes sense. If you type "git log --stat=foo", you don't get a 
diff usage message, even though it's an error parsing options that were 
originally part of diff.

This is actually probably even a good idea, because the two functions 
might actually want to give different results. Maybe revert.c will end up 
doing different sequencer operations depending on whether the commit is a 
merge, but if revert.c has to give an error, it would call it the same 
thing either way, because the difference doesn't matter at the level of 
detail the revert.c works at; on the other hand, sequencer.c would want to 
distinguish the cases so that it is explaining exactly what it's trying to 
do in this step because it matters to how the issue would be resolved.

Of course, at the point where you move the code, you only have one piece 
of code that you're starting from, so they'll be the same. But you might 
want to name them differently.

It's a hard problem, although likely worthwhile to solve. But only when 
you're not doing anything else, because it's complicated and will take you 
far afield. Essentially, what you need to do is implement a diff algorithm 
that can detect reorganization (or copying) of sections; this isn't 
something you can represent in unified diff output, but that's okay 
because you're not going to output it. You merge two of these results and 
apply the result to the base, which gives you a file (potentially with 
conflicts, which is another interesting issue because you have to 
represent and explain them somehow).

*: bisect could be using sequencer in order to handle the situation where 
the user has said "commit A is good, commit B is bad, commit C breaks my 
system in a way that's unrelated"; the system should then be able to check 
out a maybe-bad commit and revert C from it, but it would be doing this in 
response to an instruction from the user: "give me something to test 
next", and would have to present errors differently.
