Looks obviously correct (though one thing missing from the diff context
is whether "subjects" is set to DUP -- it is, which is good).

Grepping for "list_append.*detach" shows a few other possible cases in
transport-helper.c, which I think are leaks.

I wondered if it would be possible to write a coccinelle rule for this,
but I think it's not possible. Whether this is right depends on the
strdup_strings flag, which could change at runtime (though in practice
it doesn't).
