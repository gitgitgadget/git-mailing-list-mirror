I can't say that I follow that 'by omission'Â  argument. It is one of 
those argument types that sounds good in retrospect but is very hard for 
the unknowing reader to guess, especially as commas are widely taught as 
being one of the ubiquitous separators.

There is a similar issue with '/' in refs regarding the subtle 
distinctions between embedded characters that have a common convenience 
meaning vs the idea that they are all just a single whitespace separated 
string.

Given that, Robert may be able to suggest a short addendum that 
clarifies that the comma is processed elsewhere (IIUC).
