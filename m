Not currently. I've been playing with running it in an action, and may
submit something to make it more official. There's some discussion here:

  https://lore.kernel.org/git/YV5dmkkuCqAY2qqG@coredump.intra.peff.net/

There's also some on-going work to make the test suite run without
leak-checkers (I didn't dig them up, but you can find recent topics and
commits from Ã†var). But we've got a ways to go, so you'd likely find a
bunch of existing leaks if you tried it.

So no, for now there was nothing obvious you could have seen that would
have alerted you.
