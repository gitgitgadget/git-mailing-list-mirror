Sorry, it has already been shown that combining two difference hashes
doesn't necessarily provide the security that you would hope.

I think what hasn't been discussed here is the cost of actually doing
the comparisons.  In other words, what is the minimum number of
comparisons we can get away and still deal with hash collisions
successfully?

Once we know what the cost is then we can decide whether it's worthwhile
considering the odds involved.
