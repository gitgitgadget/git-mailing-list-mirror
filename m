So I happened to be looking at some packing stuff again today, and I
realized the situation is much less dire than I made it out to be.

On the reading side, we _won't_ look at tmp_pack_*, nor tmp_idx_*,
because they don't end in '.pack' or '.idx'. So really, the only
confusing case is the ".tmp-$$-etc.idx" that is generated by
pack-objects (because it thinks of that as the final name to use
itself), and then later rearranged by git-repack.

So I think we _are_ OK as long as the correct order is observed during
the rename-into-place steps.

I.e., your original patch (plus the extra post in index-pack) would mean
that we're fully covered. The .tmp-*.idx ones would appear in the
correct order due to pack-objects, and the final pack-*.idx ones due to
git-repack.
