Honestly, I see only drawbacks to that practice:
- information duplication
- too much information kills the information
- the try to transpose a non announce mailing list to a timeline

Would more agree with an agregation of tutorial, annouce, tip&trick,... 
but timelining discussions looks messy to me.

But, it's just my opinion.
