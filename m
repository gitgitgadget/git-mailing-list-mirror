I don't know why this idea keeps coming back up as GSoC project. Its
too difficult, that's why nobody has done it yet. Everyone wants to do
it. Unfortunately its incredibly difficult to layout the object data
in a way that the stream can be broken and restarted.

If you are new to Git, its unlikely you would be successful with this
particular project.
