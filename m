Either way (3 or 4 lines) I find it strange to have both advices
start in the same way except that one is split and not the other.

I cannot tell if it's a big deal or not to exceed 80 characters
but FWIW most of my stuff (terminal and emacs) is 80 columns
long, and I haven't known the "xterm days".
