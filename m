You could use --no-commit, so that the merge can be inspected and the
relevant parts picked or updated, but beware losing the second parent
link, and that you could be creating an "evil merge" (in Git terminology
that's content that was in neither parent.., rather than an automated
conflict free merge..)

For your pushing (as opposed to the professor's) look ate the
remote.pushDefault config setting allowing you to have the prof's repo
as your upstream, but your own fork as the place you naturally push to
(see
https://lore.kernel.org/git/?q=%3C20191031154217.GA30187%40sigill.intra.peff.net%3E).

Are others also doing development in the same notebook or on the same
repo during this review cycle? This can affect how any overlaps in the
changes affect each other

Are these 'large' a commit/changeset, or many smaller commits? And does
your project need good fine detail history (so you can reason about
small changes from months ago)? Some projects benefit from the fine
detail, while for others it's a waste. It will depend on whether it will
help the prof for selecting which commits to accept and which to reject
(rather than having to pick apart a large commit)

The --no-commit may be useful here to enable that early inspection
before the actual commit.

It's worth ensuring that the `rtb` (branch that tracks a remote's branch
- remote tracking branch) concept manages to stick in your head (and the
profs) - you don't need a local branch of the same name as the remote
;-) It took me a few years to get that into my head!

I commonly use the Gui when picking apart a large commit into smaller
ones when I'm happy that there's no overlaps. Small patches make for
easier merging and fault finding, and better commit messages (good
thesis practice)

Unfortunately the Git Gui doesn't have a menu for stashing remaining
changes, but it's simple to flip over to the terminal to stash from
there to do the testing, and un-stash the remainder afterwards - I'll
maybe suggest the gui could include that capability for these types of
workflows (cc Pratyush Yadav <pratiy0100@gmail.com>).

Often it is a case of tweaking the workflow to use a capability
you/she/he wasn't aware of to give you that improved review process. It
doesn't help that I'm ignorant of how the jupyter notebooks are
internally formatted and how your diffing tool shows it (have you set up
the difftool options for command line use?

No problem. As an engineer, real world workflows are an interest;-)
