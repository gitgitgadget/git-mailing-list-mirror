Yeah, the thing to look for here is whether the sha1 variable holds the
same value at both times.

These all look OK to me. Mild rambling below.

I've often wondered whether a big strbuf_addf() is more efficient than
several strbuf_addstrs. It amortizes the size-checks, certainly, though
those are probably not very big. It shouldn't matter much for amortizing
the cost of malloc, as it's very unlikely to have a case where:

  strbuf_addf("%s%s", foo, bar);

would require one malloc, but:

  strbuf_addstr(foo);
  strbuf_addstr(bar);

would require two (one of the strings would have to be around the same
size as the ALLOC_GROW() doubling).

So it probably doesn't matter much in practice (not that most of these
cases are very performance sensitive anyway). Mostly just something I've
pondered while tweaking strbuf invocations.

And anyway, in this case replacing find_unique_abbrev lets us write
directly into the final buffer rather than copying through a static
buffer, so it's almost certainly a win there.

Wow, this existing code was hard to follow. I wondered when
find_unique_abbrev() would return NULL, but it never does. This "if
(!hex)" should have been an "else" all along.

...which I see you changed here, though perhaps it is not immediately
obvious that it is correct without knowing find_unique_abbrev's return
value assumptions.

Just thinking aloud, I've also wondered if strbuf_addoid() would be
handy.  We already have oid_to_hex_r(). In fact, you could write it
already as:

  strbuf_add_unique_abbrev(sb, oidp->hash, 0);

but that is probably not helping maintainability. ;)

Spelling out ".." and "..." as you do makes this much clearer, IMHO.
