Hi Jakub,
nice work you've done there.  Well done!

Once again (AFAIR this was already raised during one of the previous  
summary) what's the link between GPLv2 and commercial support?  You  
seem to imply that because Git won't move to GPLv3, it's a good thing  
for potential paid support, or something.  I don't quite see how  
GPLvX comes into play with commercial support.  I'm not a license  
expert though.
