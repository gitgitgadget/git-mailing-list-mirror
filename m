Yeah, I think I've had to do a similar hack manually. This is an obvious
improvement. Though...

Your stderr and stdout may be redirected, too. That's usually not a big
problem because you'll be using "-v", but perhaps this should add:

  >&3 2>&4

to be on the safe side. That covers running without "-v", as well as
cases where the test script is redirecting output (I _actually_ wish gdb
behaved like perl's debugger and unconditionally used the terminal,
retaining existing redirections, but I AFAIK there's no easy way to get
it to do that).
