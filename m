Thanks.

I really wanted to point people to --parse as the go-to option for the
parsing mode for the sake of simplicity (in fact I initially considered
not even exposing them at all). And I hoped that if they jumped to the
definition of --parse, that would lead them to the other options.

I dunno. I agree it is does not read particularly well. Probably the
whole description section could be rewritten to cover the newly dual
nature of the command a bit better. But I didn't want to disrupt the
existing flow too much.
