Yeah, I agree it probably doesn't matter. I was mostly suggesting to
make the existing ">&5" into ">&7" for consistency. But I don't think
that needs to block your patch.

Yes, I added the only existing "Bail out!" to test-lib.sh. :)

I agree that's not what we want here. I actually think the current
behavior (to exit non-zero) does what we want. A TAP harness will
realize that's an error, but not block other scripts.
