This is a sensible suggestion for the documentation rather than having
it call out "add" as special (unlike the commit message in which case
it makes sense to mention that only the behavior of "add" is
affected).

Let's not mention "add" or any other command specially since the
option is meant to be general.

(/me nudges Martin off the fence onto the side of not bothering to
mention the obvious)

My knee-jerk reaction was that such tests seem unnecessary, but I
think you convinced me that they would make sense to avoid future
headaches since --quiet should indeed mean "quiet" generally. (Newly
added worktree commands would not be protected by such tests added
today, so it's not foolproof, but still better than nothing.)

Having said that, though, lack of such tests shouldn't block this
patch from being accepted. They can always be added later if someone
wants to do it.
