Mercurial also has an easier learning curve; and while the "Everyday
Git with 20 commands or so" is a very good document, and I've found it
invaluable for getting started, if you compare it to the "Quick Start
for the Impatient" page on the front page of the Mercurial Wiki, for
many people Mercurial will *appear* to be an order of magitude simpler
and is yet powerful enough for their project.

Of course, a lot of it is that git *is* much more powerful, much like
the difference between a stickshift with a racing clutch (git) and a
car with an automatic transmission (hg).  So maybe one thing that
would help git would be a stronger emphasis of cogito for those
projects that don't need the full power of using git "straight up".

Just a thought....
