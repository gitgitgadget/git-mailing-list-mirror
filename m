That's my understanding. It gets trickier with refs (which I think we
also ought to consider fsyncing), as we may create arbitrarily deep
hierarchies (so we'd have to keep track of which parts got created, or
just conservatively fsync up the whole hierarchy).

It gets a lot easier if we move to reftables that have a more
predictable file/disk structure.
