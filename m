Hi Dscho

Sorry for not replying sooner.

We still do that after this patch. What changes is that when "pick B" 
fails we don't add "pick A" to the "done" file when "pick B" is added 
back into "git-rebase-todo"

If a commit is rescheduled we still end up with multiple entries in the 
"done". In the example above if "pick B" fails the first time it is 
executed and then succeeds on the second attempt "done" will contain

	pick A
	pick B
	pick B

It might be nice to mark it as rescheduled as you suggest but this 
series focuses on removing the incorrect entry from the "done" file, not 
de-duplicating the "done" entities when a command fails.

Best Wishes

Phillip
