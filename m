Hi.

The utilities for converting CVS repositories to git repos have become
part of the standard git package, and hopefully they'll be used to
convert many CVS based projects to git. I've not seen anything, though,
on switching Subversion repositories to git. Has there been any public
activity in writing a tool/script to do this? Perhaps some offline
discussion about doing this?

Thanks in advance.
