In this case I guess we may delete "it is removed for the purpose of
the following description"
so it reads like this:

and mention the trailing slash explicitly in the two relevant paragraphs

and

Oh I see. I think that this point also led to confusion. For example,
I found this quote  at
https://stackoverflow.com/a/50029706/2311074 :

>Please note that "Otherwise" starts a new bullet point hence it's not limited to the point you've quoted.
>It means "Otherwise" from all ifs from the beginning of the section "PATTERN FORMAT".

Maybe it was intended that it just belongs to the previous paragraph?

> If the pattern does not contain a slash /, Git treats it as a shell glob pattern and checks [...].
> Otherwise, Git treats the pattern as a shell glob.

Because I do not see the connection between "otherwise (contains a
slash)" and the asterix "*".

Either way, I find it difficult for the reader. I agree with you that
its good to clarify both cases.
I would then suggest to split the paragraph into two like this and
remove "Otherwise, Git treats the pattern as a shell glob" :

> If the pattern contains a slash '/' other then a trailing slash,
> it is always considered from the root. In other words, `foo/bar`
> will match `/foo/bar` but not `/bar/foo/bar`

and

> If the pattern contains no slash '/' other then a trailing slash,
> then the pattern will match in all directories. In other words,
> `foo/` will match `/bar/foo/` and `foo` will match `/bar/foo`.
