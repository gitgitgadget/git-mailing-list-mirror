Mr. Torvalds,

I believe you'll be able to understand me. This is a copy of a message that
should be changed to convince Gnome, KDE, XFCE or / and LXDE.

I reported many bugs to Ubuntu.
To make the Ubuntu team patch them, I need to convince them that the bug is so
important that they need to work on it, so it's hard.
To make me patch them, I need to convince Ubuntu team that the bug is important,
otherwise the patch won't be approved, which is hard, then I need to patch the
bug, which is hard, then I need Ubuntu team to approve the code, which is hard,
so it's triple hard.
To develop an app, I need to code my work, others will see my name, rate it
high, install it lots, congratulate me by e-mail and recognize my work, so it's
fun, then I need approval from the Ubuntu team to have my app in the Ubuntu
Software Store, the Ubuntu team put a huge effort in the Ubuntu Software Store
and the Ubuntu team wants more apps in the Ubuntu Software Store, so it's easy,
then I show the Ubuntu team that since the app's popular, the bug is important
and according to xkcd, I'm correcting a person on the internet and that's an
important task, so it's important.

Firefox has add-ons that change the Firefox interface.
Firefox has XML DOM with getElementById, insertBefore, createElement,
setAttribute, removeChild etc and that's how you position. add, edit and remove
anything in Firefox.
A Firefox add-on is easy to create and powerful to use.
Tim Berners-Lee, an England sir, created the web and leads W3C. W3C adopted
Javascript from NETSCAPE and created XML and DOM. Think twice about whether
Javascript, XML and DOM are a good combination, because that's genial stuff, so
you will have to be sure.

Ubuntu needs an API like Firefox's XML DOM, but in C, not Javascript.

Imagine the experimentation that would happen. It would be awesome, like Firefox
is. Features that you weren't expecting would be added to Ubuntu by the others,
if you're a programmer, you would be able to create features and if you're a
user, you would be able to tell programmers what features you want and others
want too. Maybe, Windows or Apple would copy the easy platform customization
from Ubuntu which copied from Firefox and everybody would be happy.

Best regards,
Pedro Bessa
