In short, this proposal is aimed at having a better way to view the
status of a project by having issues, todos and dependencies mapped as
a graph.

My main motive behind this is that a newcomer to an open source
project can look at the graph and immediately see where he can pitch
in. Having to go through tons of issues and changelogs is generally
not so alluring.

Here is the project proposal in full:

There are 10-14 days for the mentors to finalize project details with students.
I request interested mentors to point out what needs to be changed.
Looking forward to discussing this with you. :)

Thanking you,
Suhail Sherif

(I apologize for the late submission. I have been caught up in college work.)
