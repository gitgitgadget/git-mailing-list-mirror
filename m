If we have COPY_ARRAY(), I think it's foolish not to provide the
matching MOVE_ARRAY().  If it were just the "if (n)", I might say we
could just do this inline in the few calls that care.  But I really like
the size safety.

I agree with your comments elsewhere that we don't need to worry about
the case where one of the arrays is NULL but the size is not zero.
That's a flat-out bug.
