I'd rather we keep manpages self-contained; one reason is as you said
below easier searching.  I also prefer not to have to follow from one
page to another.

On the contrary, I think it would be good idea to include full list
of a configuration variables affecting specific command in its manpage.
Currently almost all configuration variables are in git-config(1)
manpage, but some are in individual manpages, and only linked there.

Redundancy in reference documentation is not bad, provided that it
doesn't require duplication in documentation sources, and that the
documentation itself is not too long, and not too unwieldy.

One solution would be to use "apropos" / "man -k" and then filter it
(e.g. with /^git/) to filter out non-git manpages. 

Another would be to search whatis database ourselves. Yet another 
to create whatis-like database, and put it in /usr/share/doc/*.
In both of those cases Git would search the 'database' itself.

Well, for apropos-like command to work well we would need better
description of manpages, isn't it?. It is getting better, but we still
have a bit to go...

If Git was to create a whatis-like database (for future "--apropos" and
"--whatis" options to "git help"), it could add extra information, for
example keywords (which would have to be added to manpages sources,
and embedded in whatis-like database when creating man, html, etc.
documentaion formats, i.e. when building documentation).

By default Git installs into /usr/share/doc/git-x.y.z the *.txt and *.html
documentation formats. We could follow "man -K" / "man --global-apropos"
example and search sources... but then we would need to follow inclusions
at least for it to be useful. We could search HTML version of manpages...
but then we would have to strip formatting codes before performing a search.

I wonder what other version control systems do, like Mercurial, or
Subversion, or Veracity with providing access to their reference docs...
