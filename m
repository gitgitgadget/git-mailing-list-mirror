Thanks for this link! I appreciate the context.

Yes, this is my mistake. My machine supports "crontab -".

Perhaps the best way to approach this is to try adding '-'
by default, and remove it and try again on a failure. If the
usage is actually a problem, that first command should fail
quickly. I'm not sure if we could rely upon a specific
category of error codes or if we should just say "non-zero
exit means retry".

Thanks!
