Your mistake is in assuming that the folks who set up the
planetgit.org site are talking to the git developers on this list;
anyone can set up a domain name, "planet<foo>.org", without
necessarily being officially tied to project <foo>.

The planetgit.org site does say that people who want to be added to
the site should contact webmaster@planetgit.org; you might want to do
the same if you're not satisified with the content on that site.

I also suspect that you might have gotten a more positive reaction if
you said something along the lines of "hey, there seems to be this
planetgit.org site which isn't tracking a lot of blogs; could some of
the git developers consider sending their rss feed to
webmaster@planetgit.org so they can track your blog entries?"

Instead, you sound like a demanding *sshole, and people generally
don't respond well to that.

P.S.  Now I have to decide on my own whether or not I should ask
planetgit.org to add
http://thunk.org/tytso/blog/category/computers/linux/source-code-management/git/feed
to planet git.  The question is whether to reward impoliteness or not
(which is a bad thing), factored against trying to make planetgit.org
more useful (which is a good thing).
