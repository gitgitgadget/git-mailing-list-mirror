I noticed the HEAD funniness, too, when looking at this earlier. I agree
with Junio that it's not quite consistent with the general rule of
"string list items point to their refnames", but I don't think it
matters in practice.

I think the fix, if we wanted to do one, would be similar to what you
did in split_symref_update(). Like:

diff --git a/refs/files-backend.c b/refs/files-backend.c
