I'm not the original poster, but I feel the same way about the line
being unclear.

Here's a real-world example from last week.

For cairo I wrote a little script that two revspecs, (or one in
which case its first parent is used), and it goes off and checks out
both versions, builds each, runs a performance test on each, and then
generates a report showing the performance impact.

So now I can do things like:

	# What's the performance impact of my latest change:
	cairo-perf-diff HEAD

	# Have my last few changes helped as much as I'd hoped:
	cairo-perf-diff HEAD~3 HEAD

	# How has performance changed since our last stable release:
	cairo-perf-diff 1.2.6 HEAD

Anyway, when I announced this I also mentioned how easily someone
might generate an entire series of reports for a series of
commits. The command I gave as an example is:

	for rev in $(git rev-list 1.2.6..HEAD); do
	    cairo-perf-diff $rev
	done

I think that's a perfectly legitimate one-liner for users to use, and
it really shows off the easy-scriptability of git. But certainly, no
"new porcelain" author is going to consider rev-list to be porcelain
rather than plumbing, right? So as soon as I start teaching people to
do useful stuff like this, they might have to reach down into the
"scary" git interface.

I think we're much better off just having one "git" namespace for the
standard command-line interface, and then making it as easy to use as
possible.
