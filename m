You could probably do this via the clean/smugde filters via .gitattributes.

But really this loooks like suboptimal build design. You should change
the generator to not require an (empty/) file beforehand, or change
the build process to create those files before invoking the generator.
(Likewise empty directories that are neeed in the build should be
created by the build, not by the versioning system.)

All IMHO.
