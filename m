Heh. I _thought_ we had such a helper, and I even thought I remembered
the name. But when I grepped for it, I couldn't come up with it. Silly
"-i". (So I guess it's no surprise that I came up with the same

did pull from the back of my mind).

I'll drop this in favor of the macro.

Agreed, will do.

I agree none are big, but worth addressing since I was making a re-roll
anyway. Thanks.
