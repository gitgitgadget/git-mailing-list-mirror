Absolutely. What I meant is that at least the options from the synopsis
should be contained in the set of completable options.

Then let's not do that change, because for some commands destructive
long-options have been in the list of completed options for quite a
while. Given that, the above change of the documentation, might stir up
more confusion than it settles.
