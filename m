Yeah, that would be a great. Thanks for doing that!

I benefited from the GSoC fund last year and much appreciated having my=

travel expenses to go to the GitTogether reimbursed.

But I think it is ok too for developers to have an amazon wish list, so=
=20
donors can choose. And by the way Junio has one:

http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/1513KNZE30W63

so everyone is welcome to buy him something!

Another way we could perhaps use the funds (especially if we have to do=
 that=20
before the end of the year) could be to defray membership costs if some=
=20
developers want to join (or are already member of) some related=20
organisation like the Linux Foundation:

or the FSF:
