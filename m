My thought was that in some cases folks will feel they 'know' where
their system and global configs are located, but that 'git config'
command isn't showing them those contents.

That's one option.

The other, non-programmatic way, it to mention the environment variable
in the 'git config' man page, at the --show-scope section, telling folk
that if those env variables are set there won't be any scope to show!

The one that caught me was the test suit[1]. I was unable to replicate
results when I set up a test. This can be bad on Windows where some
settings need to be auto set (or are commonly set) and maybe result in
conflicts. Often what doesn't know what's been done on ones behalf.
There's plenty of spare configs to go round ;-)

Mateusz's original problem was with discovery of these env variables, so
ended up with an XY-problem of proposing a patch to redirect the
~/.gitconfig file, because relevant the env variables weren't (for him,
and previously myself) discoverable.

If we go with a 'No one reads the manuals' developer view, then the
solution has to be more code... hence my wondering if there was an easy
win inside the code, or if it needs to be a subjective update to the man
pages (never 'easy').


The man page
The GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM only gets its 1 mention as a heading, while
GIT_CONFIGÂ  has two (+ a heading). Maybe we need to spread the love for
NOSYSTEM...
