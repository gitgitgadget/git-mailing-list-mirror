Dear friends of Git,

the Git for Windows team, myself included, tried quite a couple of times
to mark the old home of Git for Windows on Google Code as obsolete.

Unfortunately, it is not possible to disable issue trackers nor downloads
(and Google Search helpfully insists on listing them as top hits, still).

It is not even possible to forward to a new project home: we tried
literally twenty times to hit the "Project moved" button with the new URL
-- http://msysgit.github.io/ -- but all it did was reset the URL to
"http://" and give a "500. That's an error." when browsing the old URL.

The link supposedly allowing to report the error leads to a read-only
knowledge base with no way to inform any responsible developer of the bug.

The only way was to delete the old project home, with no automatic
redirection and no hint for users where to look instead.

Therefore it is with great sadness that I have to resort to sending this
mail and hoping that it reaches at least a part of the people who are from
now on undoubtedly surprised to see a "Google. One account. All of
Google." page instead of being forwarded to http://msysgit.github.io/.

I am seriously sorry about the inconvenience, wishing there was anything
I could do about this,
Johannes
