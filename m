The test output requested by Johannes was to use -i -v -x. We use ksh and have for years to test git. The command used was done within a Jenkins environment and was:

cd t && sh t0500-progress-display.sh -i -v -x

> Is NonStop big or little-endian?  Does t0500 pass without 2b6f6ea1bd?

NonStop is big-endian. When t0500 is run from an interactive terminal, it passes. This failure seems to be a result of being in a disconnected terminal situation typical of Jenkins, not that the test result makes any sense with that being the only difference. t0500 did not exist in 2.23.0, our last build, so I can't easily get that answer. Our Jenkins is based off the master branch, so it's a hard to revert in our pipeline without a serious amount of work - that and without 2b6f6ea1bd, other things break if I remember from August.

Does the printf format use positional arguments (%digit$)? That has known issues on the platform.

FYI: int/long are 32 bits, long long is 64 bits. 12884901888 is 0x300000000, surprisingly.
