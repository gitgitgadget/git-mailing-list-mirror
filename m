Note also that while "creating branch is not the issue, merge is"
remains true, modern Subversion (post 1.5) makes merging easy thanks
to svn:mergeinfo property.

Though it does it in completely different way than Git and other
"graph of commits" VCS-es, because of the "branch is directory"
philosophy, namely that it keeps information about what was merged
in, rather than finding common ancestor(s) and using this information
for resolving merge.
