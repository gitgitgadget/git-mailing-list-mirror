I think we have bigger problems if "err" is messed up, because we'll be
interpreting garbage as a format string and almost certainly triggering
undefined behavior. And in general if we are not using a constant string
as the format it's a potential security vulnerability. So I think we can
mostly rely on the compile-time -Wformat checks for this.

Yeah, I think your first one is good. It's _ugly_, but it's easy to
figure out what happened, and this is not something people generally see
(and the status quo is just "fatal:", so you're easily 50% less ugly).

Agreed. Thanks for digging into it.
