I'll ignore the improbability of this turn of events (two writes happening
during the span of trying to read two files) and focus on the fact that
we can prevent issues here using the 4th TODO item in my cover letter:

 4. It would be helpful to add a new optional chunk that contains the
    trailing hash for the lower level of the commit-graph stack. This chunk
    would only be for the commit-graph-N files, and would provide a simple
    way to check that the stack is valid on read, in case we are still
    worried about other processes reading/writing in the wrong order.

If we have this chunk -- you have convinced me that we need it -- then we
could ignore the "new" commit-graph-2 because its base graph hash does not
match. We can continue without dying because we can always parse the "missing"
commits from the packs.

Thanks,
