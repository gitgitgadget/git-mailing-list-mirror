Oh indeed, I misread what you wrote in the documentation. I think it is
doing the right thing, then. IMHO it is not worth even calling out
specially, since there is no matching implicit-bool form. I.e., I'd
probably just cut the final sentence.

Hmm, yeah, that would work as an "implicit bool". But it's sufficiently
ugly and non-intuitive (and weirdly overlapping with "-c") that I'm not
sure it is worth supporting.
