Google just pre-announced that Summer of Code 2009 will run.  Its
going to be a bit smaller than last year's program due to the poor
worldwide economic climate, but the open source community is quite
fortunate that Google is footing the bill for yet another summer of
students hacking on open source projects.

Given our success last year, I think we should try applying again
this year as a mentoring organization.  I've started to put the
wiki pages together by cloning last year's stuff:

  Organization application:
    http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/SoC2009Application

  Organization ideas page:
    http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/SoC2009Ideas

FWIW, the folks who organize GSoC thought our ideas page is among
the better ones they've seen year-after-year.  So I'm largely
keeping the same format.  :-)

The application answers really need to be reworked; we need to
address our 2008 results in these parts.

The ideas box is once again open for suggestions.  Please start
proposing student projects, and possible mentors.


Since the program is smaller, there is a chance we won't be accepted
this year due to space constraints.  But I think its still worthwhile
to prepare everything and hope for the best.  And before you can
ask, no, my employee status with OSPO doesn't improve our odds
for acceptance.  :-)
