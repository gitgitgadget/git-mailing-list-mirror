Let me reorder those issues and group them into specific categories.

Those are issues about lack of integration (or need for better integration)
with GitHub pull requests.  I don't know if tighter integration would be
possible (without going the route of web browser plugin, like ZenHub) with
current API.  Note that many integrations require you to go and use their
separate site, like e.g. HuBoard.

Also, for some people registering on GitHub is "yet another service"... ;-)

These are, I think, mainly related to lack of support for series *iteration*,
for sending new version of patch series / of pull request.

I don't know how well GitHub pull requests deal with iteration and
refinement, and what is available as API to apps such as submitGit.

I guess that turning submitGit into two-way bridge between email and PR's
would be quite difficult, if at all possible.  For one, it would have
to parse emails to turn response as email into comment on diff in PR.
For second, I'm not sure if all features of email workflow are possible
to represent in PR's: cover letter, comments for individual commits,
commits about commit messages, commits about changes, free-form comments.
But maybe they are possible; the trouble would be in translating back
and forth.

Well, you cannot extend/fix GitHub at all yourself, isn't it? ;-P

Right.

I probably don't have as many topics in flight, and maybe the number of
iterations is smaller, but I don't remember having troubles with that.

Well, when I was most active doung Git development I were using StGit
patch management interface instead of rebase -i; I think it makes things
easier.  Perhaps git-series could replace it, or augment it.

That was a typo: s/exiting/existing/

It might be that they don't need features not available in a web app.
It might be that it is only way they know.  Not all projects are happy
to being on GitHub even if they are happy with using hosted git.

And they were probably created after GitHub / GitLab / Bitbucket were
here. Also - citation needed.

Those are projects that started before GitHub (for obvious reasons), and
which created a good enough workflow based on email.  It might be that
they are ossified relics, or it might be that they don't want to trade
advantages of email based workflow for advantages of web app based workflow.


First, email clients and Usenet news readers support threading.  I haven't
found a good web app that supports threading well (though it might be
a matter of small set of such apps examined by me).  They allow marking
and labeling posts to return back later.

Second, email allows offline work, and handle well sporadic Internet
connection.  As far as I know web apps do not handle breaks in net
access well, but I might be mistaken.  Hopefully this problem would
vanish with improving broadband... though there always would be places
without constant always-on Internet connection.

Third, email (or rather conventions around email) allows to provide
 - description of the whole series (in cover letter)
 - comments for each commit individually (outside of commit message)
 - make commit or series be a reply to discussion (useful with WIPs)
For reviewer it allows to
 - comment on the whole series in response to cover letter
 - comment on individual commit
 - comment on the commit message
 - comment on the description of commit
 - comment on changes
 - start a discussion based on a commit
 - propose improvements as patches

Are all of them possible in PR's?


To reiterate what I have said elsewhere in this thread: while it is
a good idea to lower barriers to contribution, especially for new classes
of users (like MS Windows users, without a way to easily install and
configure MTA so that git-send-email and/or git-imap-send just works,
or with default email client without support for preserving whitespace
and monospace fonts), it is reviewers and maintainers that are sparse
resource.

Best,
