It worked fine at 2.3.7. No seeming dependency on docbook at that point - it was never on my system.

Not an option. I need git help to work.

Ruby runs fine. I'm a bit out of my configuration depth here.

I've gone down this path and it works. Much cleaner in fact. Dependencies of docbook (jade) are too reliant on GCC C++ forms to port to the platform - not to mention being SVN, which is culturally uncomfortable ðŸ˜‰

One request to Junio: Would it be possible to tag the commits to align with the tags in the main repo? That way, I can build a nice little Jenkins job to automatically fetch the correct commit for man pages when packaging up a release.
