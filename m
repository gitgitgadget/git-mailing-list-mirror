This is just when rendering with asciidoctor, right? AFAICT the bolding
is still fine in pages built with asciidoc.

Both the explanation and the solution make sense. We'd eventually be
able to drop this duplicate xsl if we go asciidoctor-only.

I have more general thoughts below, but the patch itself looks good to
me (and IMHO is worth taking for 2.24).

I somehow missed that we turned on this bolding by default. I can
finally delete MAN_BOLD_LITERAL from my config.mak. ;)

I don't think this was intentional, but just a consequence of
redirecting man's stdout to a non-terminal. Doing:

  MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING=1 ./doc-diff --asciidoctor HEAD^ HEAD

on your patch shows the improvement, though note that the diffed version
is kind of ugly. It looks like the bolding is done with ^H characters,
and it interacts in a funny way with our diff coloring, as well as with
diff-highlight if you use it. Piping the above through "less" looks
decent, but it gives me pause on whether we should be setting that
variable inside the script.

One other annoyance is that the directory names we use as a key for
caching results from run to run don't know about MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING. So
you may need "-f".

Speaking of annoyances, is it just me, or does the rendering stage of
doc-diff not actually proceed in parallel? Doing this seems to help, but
I'm not sure why:

diff --git a/Documentation/doc-diff b/Documentation/doc-diff

I like the phrase "optically tested". :)

I also confirmed with the MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING trick above that "doc-diff
--asciidoctor" fixes the problem as advertised, and "--asciidoc" has no
change at all.

It will only be noticed by people building with asciidoctor. But it _is_
a regression for them in 2.24, and the patch seems pretty safe. So I
think it's probably worth doing, but if it doesn't happen until the next
maint release, I don't think it's the end of the world.

It looks like a lot of them don't actually match on the namespaced
tagnames, and so are OK. Some of them require special options to enable,
so we wouldn't necessarily notice problems via doc-diff.

From my brief look, I think suppress-sp is the only one that needs
attention. I kind of wonder if we can just drop it. According to the
Makefile comment, it's needed only for docbook 1.69.1-1.71.0. But 1.71.1
came out in 2006. Surely even RHEL7 or whatever ancient system people
use is past that, right? :)

Or alternatively, as I've argued elsewhere, we could simply be a little
more aggressive about deprecating old doc build tools. According to the
Makefile, no extra settings are needed with docbook >1.73.0. That came
out in 2007. I'd be willing to just call that the cutoff point, and
anybody without it can install the pre-formatted pages.
