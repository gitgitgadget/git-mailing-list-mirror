Thanks for explaining. Yeah, I think leaving it as a custom thing makes
sense, then.

Yeah, the use of REF_PARANOIA there was just an easy illustration. IMHO
it would be reasonable for upload-pack to just assume that the refs
files are valid. If they aren't, then either:

  - the receiver is uninterested in those objects or already has them,
    so won't ask for them. They're happy either way.

  - the receiver _will_ ask for them, at which point we'd barf later in
    pack-objects when we try to access them.

There are some thoughts in this old thread which introduce
GIT_REF_PARANOIA:

  https://lore.kernel.org/git/20150317073730.GA25267@peff.net/

I think I was mostly too cowardly to make the change back then. And I
hadn't considered that the performance implications would be all that
big (though I will say this million-ref repo is at the edge of what I'd
consider reasonable).

Thanks for taking a look! I think we can proceed with your series for
now, then.
