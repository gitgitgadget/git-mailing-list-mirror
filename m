I think a global test mode for it would be a very good idea.

Does this issue rise to the level of needing a security point-release
(which I'm discussing here as the details are already public). The
transfer.hideRefs docs have said:

    Even if you hide refs, a client may still be able to steal the
    target objects via the techniques described in the "SECURITY"
    section of the gitnamespaces(7) man page; itâ€™s best to keep private
    data in a separate repository.

So we never promised to hide the objects, but definitely promised to
hide the ref names. I don't know if anyone uses this in practice for
secret ref names, but if they do they have a data leak if they enable
protocol v2.

More importantly, the docs for receive.hideRefs say. "An attempt to
update or delete a hidden ref by git push is rejected.". It seems this
bit was enforced, i.e. this passes before and after your 3/3, but I have
not dug enough to be 100% satisfied with that.

If there's some bug where you can bypass this push protection that would
be much worse. E.g. GitLab uses "keep-around" refs to track its own
internal state, and it would be bad if users could manipulate it.
