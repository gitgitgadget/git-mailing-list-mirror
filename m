Makes sense. Well explained.

s/scipt/script/ in the paragraph above.

I agree that 6 is probably reasonable. I wonder if it is worth having a
master comment describing the function of various descriptors within the
test suite, so that people know which ones are available for which
purposes.  It is getting awfully crowded in that space. Sadly, I don't
think we can portably use numbers higher than 9 (bash is happy to, but
even dash cannot).

Of course people would have to know to look for said comment, which they
may not do. :)
