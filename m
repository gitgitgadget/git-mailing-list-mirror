TBH, I don't find it an improvement because of the extra buffer
handling. But I admit that I don't really care between any of the
solutions posted here. They all appear to be correct, and just trading
off various properties so that none is definitively better than the
other. (And none of them is so bad that I feel compelled to avoid it).

So I'd be OK with any of them (or leaving it as-is).
