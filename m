I recognize that a specification of the current commit could be
precious, (as mentioned in a thread talking about the possibility of
git-bisect using detached head rather than a branch).

And that's why I proposed a checkout away from detached head just
printing the name of the commit that was being left.

Is there any other precious information that that solution would not
address?
