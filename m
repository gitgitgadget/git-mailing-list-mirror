Hello,

The latest Git version for Windows (1.7.7.1; GUI) work very slow (it means that I
have to wait tens seconds or even few minutes for open the application, scan
files, read history and other...).
I don't see changes in speed in another aplications installed on my computer.
The previous version Git (1.7.6), which I had installed, it has worked normaly.

OS:Windows 7 x64 (Home Premium, SP1),
CPU: Intel Core i5 M520 2.40GHz
RAM: 4GB

Martin
