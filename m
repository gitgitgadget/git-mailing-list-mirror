My sentiments exactly. Actually this list is one of the best I ever met
or subscribed to. Even posts with the meaningless subject "Help needed"
are answered. I've seen some of them. Few, though. Please, people, stick
to what Peff suggests. I think for most newbees this list is the last
effort AFTER googling, so googling won't help.

Cheers,
