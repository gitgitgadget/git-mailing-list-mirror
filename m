Given the earlier report that started the thread Duy linked, I guess 
there will need to be a balance between the two expectations.

The DWIMmingÂ  may need to both report that it's not a command, but then 
offer the concept guide as the primary target if correct, or perhaps as 
one of the alternate "commands" if closely named to a guide (e.g. 
revisions vs revision).

One of the issues back then was the lack of a complete list of 'guides' 
to check against, so the badly spelt command logic wasn't brought into play.
