Sorry, I should have been more clear. By "saved" I meant "we needed N
minutes of CPU time, but took only M minutes of real time to use it."
IOW, if we assume that the threading had zero overhead and that we were
completely CPU bound, then the task would have taken N minutes of real
time. And obviously those assumptions aren't true, but I was attempting
to say "it would have been at most N minutes of real time to do it
single-threaded."

Yes, but balanced by one thread running out of data way earlier than the
other, and completing the task with only one CPU. I am doing a 4-thread
test on a quad-CPU right now, and I will also try it with threads=1 and
threads=6 for comparison.

I am working each time from the pack generated by fetching from
git://git.infradead.org/gcc.git.
