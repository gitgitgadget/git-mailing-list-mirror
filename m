Get over it.  kB is not the same as km.  It really means something 
different.  And all all people who actually _understand_ something of the 
matter know what a kilobyte is.

Just because some _wankers_^Wbureaucrats decided to make life hard on 
those people who have actually a _clue_ on real life, does not mean that 
we have to accept it.

1kB = 1024 bytes.

1MB = 1024*1024 bytes.

Everybody who claims anything else is just an annoyance to the rest of the 
world, who is not clueless, thank you very much.

And hard disk manufacturers be damned, and should burn in hell.

Ciao,
Dscho
