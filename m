It is available at http://ituglib.connect-community.org/apps/Ituglib/SrchOpenSrcLib.jsf but we have limited abilities to modify anything but that page. There is a brief release note but nothing sufficient to have a discussion.

Not enough for what I think are our needs.

Thanks, I'll take these to the team.

Base Perl does not have a lot of capability beyond a simple interpreter. The CPAN project,  https://www.cpan.org/, provides implementations of useful modules, including Source Code Management (SCM) modules that enable things like cvsserver AFAIK, and Mercurial to run. Without it (being the ability to arbitrarily add CPAN modules, which is an issue on NonStop), Perl tends to be a bit handcuffed and blindfolded. ðŸ˜‰

Thanks for the suggestions,
Randall
