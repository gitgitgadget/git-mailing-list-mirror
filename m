To the people who have replied so far: please read Amir's original
message again. The point is not if you or anyone is interested in Amir'=
s
blog or who he is or whatever (some possibly appropriate measures were
already mentioned in this thread), the point is that if what Amir
described is true (and I see no reason to doubt that), some Git Wiki
admin obviously behaves like a jerk. I admire Amir's patience,
politeness and constructive reaction to that and hope the person who
abused him will give up admin privileges or at least apologise.
