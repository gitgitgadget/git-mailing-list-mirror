Hi,

Which would require the _recipient_ to choose Thunderbird, newer ones, as 
their mail program.

Hey, it is a free world, I like Firefox, for example, and you would have 
to rip it out of my dead, cold hands.

I just do not care for Thunderbird, I started using pine a long time 
ago, too long to change now, but that is just my choice, I guess.

It's just for that really important workflow -- sending patches as easily 
commentable text that still works as input to GNU patch or git-apply -- 
that I will recommend against using Thunderbird, as there are other 
mailers which can do it without much clickety-click.

BTW in contrast to other people, I do not feel insulted that you chose Hg 
for Mozilla; as I said, it is a free world (as long as we can keep it that 
way, at least).

Ciao,
Dscho
