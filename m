Something like that kind of already exists.  The 'branch' field.
Internal repos would most likely use the '.' value to indicate that the
submodules should track the superproject's branch.  While a value of say
'foo' would indicate that the submodule should always be on branch
'foo'; this could be used for external repositories.
