The archives have all the posts of people claiming that there were no
issues with revno's and fully distributed models.  But it's okay, the
issue really isn't all that important in the big scheme of things.  Bzr
and Git have much more in common than they have differences.  I reject
that revno's are an example of where bzr is superior than Git, but
there are no doubt examples where I would concede that bzr has the edge.

Cheers,
Sean
