There's another thing to consider, which makes the introduction of
"P" as the new option even more desirable.  Let me explain.

With the upcoming changes to the way less(1) as the pager works,
which was already discussed at length and even required new features
to be implemented in less(1), [1] displaying anything through less(1)
will not leave an accessible scrollback in the terminal emulator.
Only one screen worth of text will be displayed, even after quitting
less(1).  That's what we have to do, to fix age-old issues with the
pager-generated scrollback that easily gets corrupted and actually
becomes misleading.

Thus, if someone wants to have a complete longer-than-one-screen hunk
displayed and use the terminal emulator scrollback to inspect the
hunk in its entirety, passing such (or all) hunks through the pager
would make such inspection impossible.  I'd assume that at least some
Git users already do that (I do, for example), and we surely don't want
to make that no longer possible.  That's why introducing "P" as the
new option would be the desired approach.
