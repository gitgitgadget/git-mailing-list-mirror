I was actually puzzled how SHELL_PATH matters here at all, since the
resulting script does not mention it.

What happens is that we first try to execve("./e space.sh"), can get
ENOEXEC. And then we resort to passing it to the shell, which then uses
historical shell magic (which apparently predates the invention of #!
entirely!) to decide to run it as a script using the current shell. And
that shell is selected via the SHELL_PATH at build time (and not the
$SHELL_PATH we have in our environment here).

So I think this fix and the explanation are correct. I do think it would
be a lot less subtle (and a lot more readable) as:

  write_script "e space.sh" <<-\EOF &&
  echo space >"$1"
  EOF

but that is orthogonal to what you're fixing.
