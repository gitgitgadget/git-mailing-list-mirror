>From your tree diagram, it seemed that trunk/ and branches/ were at
the same depth in your SVN repository.  However, in your generated
fetch lines they all started with "branches/" in front, yet your
trunk fetch line had "all/" in front of trunk, so maybe prefixing
the generated ones with "all/" helps?
