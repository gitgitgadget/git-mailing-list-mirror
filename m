I do not think we have definite rules, but I would generally expect to
see "data" as an opaque thing (e.g., passing "void *data" to callbacks).
"buf" or "buffer" makes sense here, but I don't think it really matters
that much either way.

I'd agree. A large number of functions in git are not reentrant, and I
would not want to give the impression that those missing a warning are
safe to use.

There is a good reason to do size checks as a subtraction from a known
quantity: you can be sure that you are not introducing an overflow
(e.g., Jakub's suggestion does the wrong thing when "size" is within 4
bytes of its maximum value). That's unlikely in this case, but then so
is the size exceeding LARGE_PACKET_MAX in the first place (arguably this
should be a die("BUG"), because it is the caller's responsibility to
split their packets.
