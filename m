Dear diary, on Mon, Dec 12, 2005 at 02:12:10AM CET, I got a letter
where Petr Baudis <pasky@suse.cz> said that...
>   this is Cogito version 0.16.1, the next stable release of the

  By the way, did anyone receive the 0.16 announcement? I have it in my
=sent mailbox, but not in either the git@ or linux-kernel@ mailboxes...
*perplexed*

  Thanks,
