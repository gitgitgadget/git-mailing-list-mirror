Cute.  It turns it into a series of 8-byte xors. The original open-coded
loop doesn't end up nearly as optimized with gcc-7.

I suspect many calls in practice are of the binary-result type. So some
of the speedup I saw may have been from compiler improvements and not
libc improvements. Still, I think the general argument is the same,
replacing "if your libc memcmp is fast" with "if your libc/compiler
makes memcmp fast".
