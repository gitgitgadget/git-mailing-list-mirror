There is a small practical problem with that: How would you find out I'm
using a modified version of your code internally? Also, the "distribution"
part of GPLv2 is a useful filter: Only such modifications that are
worthwhile to distribute get back, not each and every corner I paint myself
into while playing around.

All in all, a nice balance, IMVHO.
