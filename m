 Content preview:  Here are all of the patches for git-subtree that have been
    posted to the mailing list that I could apply and test in a reasonable amount
    of time. These are all rebased from trunk as of tonight. Many apologies for
    being *so* behind. Work has been a bear but I'm hoping things will ease up
    in the new year and I can be more regularly active. But still, don't expect
    same-day service. :) [...]

These are also available on branch "toupstream" via
