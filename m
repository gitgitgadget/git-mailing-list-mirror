Absolutely. Now that I've finished the editing I'll look
into that.

I'll check your folder idea. If that's correct then that would
be an excellent way to do it. I had already thought of updating
the README but I'm not sure if this would be sufficient.

I'll check that.

I'll also look into that.

These are all great suggestions, which I appreciate. I didn't
do any of this for the 1st edition, which, in retrospect,
was probably a mistake.

> BTW. I thought that Pro Git used Markdown, not AsciiDoc?

Nope. Asciidoc. See

You're absolutely right. I probably should have squashed those commits.
Those comments aren't really intended for public consumption.
Since I made many changes per commit, I really couldn't give an
instructive commit message.

Now that this edition is done, I plan on following good commit
practices in the future.

That would be great. I think I'm setup for that now in my GitHub
repo for that book.
