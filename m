Although I'm not convinced that completion of modified files is unnecessary, I'm at least persuaded that not all users would welcome such a change. Given the hint from Gabor that Alt-/ forces filesystem completion, there is even no big win in stopping to offer further refnames after one has already been given.

If you think that this would be desirable, find a revised version below. Otherwise drop it.

Yes, my bad. I was confusing it with the case where filename and ref name are identical.

Correct, good eyes.

Ideally yes. The latter of the two would also not work with Alt/.

Subject: [PATCH] completion: checkout: complete paths when ref given

Git-checkout completes words starting with '--' as options and other
words as refs. Even after specifying a ref, further words not starting
with '--' are completed as refs, which is invalid for git-checkout.

With this commit completion suppresses refname suggestion after finding
what looks like a refname. Words before a '--' not starting with a '-'
and containing no ':' are considered to be refnames.
