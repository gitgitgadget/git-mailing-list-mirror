Hey Junio,

I just saw this message when switching branches:

-- snip --
Switched to branch "fiji"
Your branch is behind the tracked remote branch 'origin/fiji' by 9 commits,
and can be fast-forwarded.
-- snap --

It really helped a lot (I would have tested the old version, and would not 
have been able to reproduce the bug I have been told about).

So this really saved me some frustrating hours.

Thanks,
Dscho
