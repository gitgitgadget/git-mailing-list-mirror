OK, the patch I came up with is below.

OK. It does mean that:

  git show HEAD:a*

will still quietly produce no output instead of saying "hey, there is no
a* in HEAD". But I think given the lack of bug reports over the years
that this case (and the backslash one I'm fixing) are probably
relatively rare.  The backslash one seems a lot more likely, just
because Windows folks may treat it like a path separator (I'm not sure
if that even works, considering its meaning in a glob, but certainly I
can imagine somebody doing so as an experiment and getting confused by
the result).

Perhaps that can be Git's motto. ;)

Anyway, here's the patch. Even though this is rare, I think it's worth
doing. The code is simple and I don't anticipate anybody complaining
about the tightening.

Subject: verify_filename(): handle backslashes in "wildcards are pathspecs" rule

Commit 28fcc0b71a (pathspec: avoid the need of "--" when wildcard is
used, 2015-05-02) allowed:

  git rev-parse '*.c'

without the double-dash. But the rule it uses to check for wildcards
actually looks for any glob special. This is overly liberal, as it means
that a pattern that doesn't actually do any wildcard matching, like
"a\b", will be considered a pathspec.

If you do have such a file on disk, that's presumably what you wanted.
But if you don't, the results are confusing: rather than say "there's no
such path a\b", we'll quietly accept it as a pathspec which very likely
matches nothing (or at least not what you intended). Likewise, looking
for path "a\*b" doesn't expand the search at all; it would only find a
single entry, "a*b".

This commit switches the rule to trigger only when glob metacharacters
would expand the search, meaning both of those cases will now report an
error (you can still disambiguate using "--", of course; we're just
tightening the DWIM heuristic).

Note that we didn't test the original feature in 28fcc0b71a at all. So
this patch not only tests for these corner cases, but also adds a
regression test for the existing behavior.
