The one I quoted is direct from the Synopsis, which does indicate there are 
potentially more aspects to resolve, such as the influence of using the 
[-p|--patch] options.

It maybe that the paragraph / sentence that needs adjusting is;

'git checkout' with <paths> or `--patch` is used to restore modified or
deleted paths to their original contents from the index or replace paths
with the contents from a named <tree-ish> (most often a commit-ish).

and split it at the "or replace paths" option to pick out your specific 
case.

Ah yes, "specify a specific" does sound a bit tautological.
