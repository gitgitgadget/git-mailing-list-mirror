It's not clear what downside you are pointing out; i.e. why would it
be a bad thing to be able to set the branch description even while
bisecting -- especially since `git status` affirms that it knows the
branch?

It is one-shot, but the existing `--edit-description` code already
cleans up after itself by releasing resources it allocated (as do
other one-shot parts of cmd_branch()), so it would be odd and
inconsistent for this new code to not clean up after itself, as well
(or, more accurately, to only clean up after itself in some branches
but not others).

A separate preparatory patch doesn't make sense in this case since
'branch_name' becomes "freeable" with this patch itself (prior to
that, it was `const char *`).

Anyhow, a different approach was later proposed[1] which eliminates
some of the ugliness.
