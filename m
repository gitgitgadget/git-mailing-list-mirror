Yeah, perhaps. That makes it impossible for a program to intentionally
ignore the config. But it looks like even plumbing diff commands load
userdiff (which makes sense; they control its behavior through things
like ALLOW_TEXTCONV). So it's probably fine to have it everywhere.

Other options include:

  1. Just loading it always as part of git_default_config.

  2. Lazy-loading it on the first call. This seems elegant, though it
     does open up hidden cache-invalidation issues. E.g., somebody asks
     for userdiff_find_by_path(), we load the values, then they
     setup_git_repository(), and we would need to reload. That's
     far-fetched for userdiff, but it makes lazy-loading as a general
     pattern a bit of a potential maintenance trap.

     We could also introduce some infrastructure to deal with that
     (e.g., if callers could ask the config machinery "have you been
     invalidated"). That would help here and in other places (e.g., I
     considered this when dealing with get_shared_repository()).

I did it with:

  TZ=PST8PDT git archive ...

which let me get a bit-for-bit match with what GitHub generates. The
real problem was just knowing that I needed to do that. OTOH, we're
considering having GitHub generate all archives in UTC for sanity's
sake, and it would be nice to do that by setting zip.timezone instead of
hacking $TZ for each invocation.

That was my first thought, but there are already two config calls:
write_archive() loads default config, but then archive-tar loads
tar-specific config. Since only zip cares about userdiff, I patterned it
after the latter. But arguably everybody _could_ end up calling into
userdiff. If we take that philosophy, though, I'd be more inclined to
push it into git_default_config(). That covers archive writers _and_ any
other programs which might happen to call into the diff code.

Thanks for reviewing.
