You are right; I appreciate this approach.

You are right, trying to change the southern border in this way is not
quite reliable if there are no empty lines whatsoever and can
erroneously cause the function context to not include the bottom of the
function being changed.

I'm splitting the function boundary detection logic into separate
functions and trying to solve the above case without breaking the tests
(and adding a new test for the above case too).

I'll see if I can additionally provide some toggles (flags or config
variables) to control the new behaviour, what I had in mind was:

   -W[=preamble,=no-preamble]
   --function-context[=preamble,=no-preamble]
   diff.functionContextPreamble = <bool>

(where the new logic is controlled by the new config variable and
overridden by the presence of =preamble or =no-preamble).

Then it also shouldn't be too difficult to add

   diff.<driver>.preamble = <regex>
   diff.<driver>.xpreamble = <regex>

to override the heuristic used for function border detection in
exceptional cases.

You can argue about the naming now ;-) But I will use this for a start,
renaming/reworking it (or throwing it away) afterwards should be easy
once the code has been written.
