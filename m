I think we don't have enough data to really know how much it will help
or hurt. :)

On the plus side, it is less risky than dropping the end-point crud removal
entirely.

But it still risks losing a case where some code path relies on the crud
cleanup for odd cases (mismatched delimiters, or interleaved delimiters,
or non-delimiter crud mixed in with delimiters).

On the one hand, I am actually OK with dropping the crud removal
entirely and seeing what happens, and this is a lesser form of that. On
the other hand, it puts us in a funny in-between situation where tools
can _usually_ get away without cleaning up the names, but occasionally
get bit. It might be easier to just say that we don't do cleanup.

So I dunno. There is no patch to be discussed, and I am not volunteering
to write one.  So I think whoever chooses to do so has a lot of control
over what is proposed. :)
