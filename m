There is confusion here between the repository and the tarball.  Once you
have produced the tarball there is NO cryptographic protection against
forgeries unless you sign it with GPG.  That is my point: either produce
signatures with the tarballs, or don't provide them at all and force users
to clone the repository.  Git itself provides internal crytopgraphic
protection with its commit tags.

The stability of the head depends on the policies followed by the developers
and cannot be known by users not intimately involved in the development.  In
any event if there is a tarball most users assume that it represents a more
stable state of the repository than the head and they will tend to use it,
even if they already have a version of the code, instead of cloning the
repository directly.

Git, and its signing key, are high-value targets for the bad guys, even
higher than the kernel itself.  I hope you will give just a moment's thought
to the damage that will be done if bad guys succeed in a DNS poisoning
attack and succeed in passing off a phony git tarball with a back door in
the git code itself to a major code project.  Any code produced in a
repository using that phony version of git can then itself be corrupted.

It is only because kernel.org exercised due diligence in the production of
tags and signatures on all their tarballs that the kernel code itself
withstood their recent intrusion.  I suspect that their signing key was not
so lucky and needs to be changed.  The situation now is really dangerous
with various important projects scattered about, including git, which are
being operated without proper consideration of security.
