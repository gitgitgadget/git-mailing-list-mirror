Do they ever touch to the kernel core? You say that they are developing=

drivers, they basically use core kernel interfaces but not modify them =
right?

=46or quite a few years now, the kernel build system has allowed one to=
 build=20
drivers out of the kernel tree (but _using_ the kernel tree) fairly eas=
ily.=20
Why not go this route? You won't have any conflict problems anymore, _a=
nd_=20
you can maintain (and update) your kernel tree regularly.
