But why on earth would you want to use --allow-empty? There is no reason
for that. Just let deploy be where it is when you created it (until you
actually add something to it).

Assuming you didn't intentionally change it during rebase, yes.

That is exactly what git does all the time. You can use many
command. For instance git log --graph master...deply whill show you both
branches, starting from their common ancestor. "git merge-base deploy
master" will tell you that the common ancestor is. Etc.
