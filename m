I do think they're interesting, though probably not a good fit for the
SoC ideas page because of their size.

I'd rather have them on a separate page. Which brings up the question of
whether they should be moved at all. I had never intended for this wiki
to be the official git wiki. I just wanted a convenient place to stick
GSoC stuff, and I didn't want to deal with the official wiki question.

So where do people want the wiki? It would be easy to host it somewhere
more official looking, like https://github.com/git/git/wiki. David
mentioned that Google Code has wikis which are backed by git now. I have
no idea if kernel.org is ever planning on bringing back an editable
wiki.

Wherever the actual hosting occurs, we could also probably get a nicer
name like wiki.git-scm.com.
