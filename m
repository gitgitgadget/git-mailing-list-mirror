Hmm. I'm unsure whether your simplified setup is really showing
something interesting or whether we'd need to have true "static inline"
functions that are actually _used_ in a hash table to see if there are
any significant differences.

But...

Yeah, my gut feeling is it probably doesn't matter much to the overall
operation even if the inner code is slightly different (though I'm happy
to be overridden by real data). And it's definitely something we can
punt on for later (or never if nobody feels like dealing with it).
