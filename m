Note that commits and timestamps can be forged easily. I'm not worried
that Git does not work "correctly" with forged timestamps (as long as it
is not exploitable); but when it is simple to make foolproof, we should
do it.

BTW, 32-bit timestamps cover just ~135 years (not half the age of
Earth). That's too little for people who want to store historic
documents in a Git repository.
