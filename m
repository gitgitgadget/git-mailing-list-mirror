I've spent too much time just "talking" on this list and I'd like to
start "doing" more.

I can see a lot of things that I think I could improve in the
documentation, but when I tried to build them, I'm getting broken man
pages as a result. For example with "man git" I now see:

       Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich
       command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to
       internals..sp See this [1]tutorial to get started, then see [2]Everyday Git for a
       useful minimum set of commands, and "man git-commandname" for documentation of each
       command. CVS users may also want to read [3]CVS migration..sp The COMMAND is either
       a name of a Git command (see below) or an alias as defined in the configuration
       file (see git-repo-config(1))..sp

I appear to be using asciidoc 7.1.2. Does anyone here know what's
causing the above and how to fix it?

-Carl
