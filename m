Noted.  I just barely speak enough deb to build binary packages,
and the source packaging and upload procedure are something I've
never bothered to learn, so I won't be touching that area from
now on.

Since you have debian.org e-mail address, perhaps you can feed
me patches to debian/ area and deb: rule in the main Makefile?
I was asked to use dpkg-buildpackage/dpkg-genchanges and produce
the *.changes file as well by somebody who maintains his own
private apt source.  I'd appreciate if you can take care of it
when you update the Makefile deb: rule as well, if the *.changes
file request makes sense to you.
