I think we should list explicitly any editor that we have Git
integration for, or which we know is popular and people have asked
about in the past, and leave an other for people to enter other
editors.

We know about Emacs, Vim, Eclipse, TextMate all having some sort
of Git integration.  We know people have asked about NetBeans,
KDevelop and Anjuta.  After that yea, Notepad++ and Visual Studio
are two commonly used tools that people may use.

Anyone know of anything missing from this list?
