I disagree.  This is insane.

Indeed.  And if fragmentation is indeed wasting half of Git's memory 
usage then we'll have to come with a custom memory allocator.

No.  That would be the equivalent of holding each revision of all files 
uncompressed all at once in memory.

No it may not.  This theory is wrong as explained before.

It's not only for repack.  Someone just reported git-blame being 
unusable too due to insane memory usage, which I suspect is due to the 
same issue.
