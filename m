Yes, I think that's another issue in the same test. There's more
discussion further down in the thread I linked earlier, starting here:

  https://public-inbox.org/git/20190829143805.GB1746@sigill.intra.peff.net/

and I think GÃ¡bor's solution here:

  https://public-inbox.org/git/20190830121005.GI8571@szeder.dev/

is the right direction (and note that this _isn't_ just a test artifact,
but a bug that occasionally hits real-world cases, too).

Hrm. I'd have thought those are both coming from the same process. Which
implies that we're not fflushing stderr before calling write(2). But
your patch seems to do so...

<scratches head> Aha. I think you force-pushed up as I am typing this.
:) So I think that is indeed the solution.

The worst part is that this message already _is_ consumed by fetch: we
send it twice, once over the sideband, and once directly to stderr. In
most cases the stderr version is lost, but some server providers might
be collecting it. I wouldn't mind seeing the direct-to-stderr one
dropped. There's some more discussion in (from the same thread linked
earlier):
