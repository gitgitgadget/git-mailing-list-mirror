Yes. Of course. My proposed commands still accept a revision
argument, (they just defaulted to HEAD when one was not provided).

Yeah, me too. I've made enough noise for now. I'll spend more time
using things before proposing anything else, and come back with
something more concrete (== patches) next time instead of just lots of
talk.

Anyway, thanks again for the time. And sorry for the distraction.

No reply necessary from this one. :-)

PS. Thanks for the several examples. That's more good training for me,
(the operations here provide a lot of help for things I've always had
to do much more manually with things like CVS). And that's also more
content for tutorials, (and yes, I did mean to sound like I would like
to help generate some of those---I've got some people I'm trying to
convince to switch to git right now, and they'll need some training).
