Not sure - I think roots are such a special case that TREESAME 
effectively doesn't matter. We always test for roots first.

That feels a bit radical - I believe we need to retain (some) parent 
information for modes that show it (eg the dangling unfilled circles in 
gitk). And making it a root I think could cause other problems with 
making it look like we have a disjoint history. I believe the next 
simplification step may be trying to follow down to the common root.

I was hoping GÃ¡bor would carry on, as he's made a start... I was just 
planning to back-seat drive.

Likewise - I have been quite deep into this, but it was a quite short 
window of investigation a long time ago, and I've not looked at it 
since. Would like input from someone with more active knowledge.
