wow

sorry I rubbed you the wrong way.
that was by no means my intention and I'm surprised that you took it that way.

AFAIK I was being polite and positive. I've sent you a patch by which I made it
work. I just asked whether there would be a new release _without_ expecting
anything.

besides, for me the -2 question was totally valid in the light of a broken
installer and what you did the last time that happened

I have no time to build my own installer. I guess we're both swamped by work...
