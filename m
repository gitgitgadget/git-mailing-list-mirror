That would be OK with me, but I think it would just replace the calls to
"sort". To do the "just sort the iteration, but not the rest of the
output that I'm talking about above", the change _has_ to go into
test-hashmap.c (but I think I still favor just sorting the whole thing
for simplicity).

Given that we don't actually care that much about looking at the
resulting diff (and so we don't care about preserving order), I think
just sorting both sides gives equivalent results and is much simpler.
