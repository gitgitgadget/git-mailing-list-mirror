If you are really using topic branches, a better workflow would be
to make use of them.  That is, do the development of new features
on topic branches, test them in relative isolation, and when deemed
ready merge them into development branch, for more testing (including
integration testing).

Then, those topic branches that are considered stable are merged
into stable branch ("trunk").  You can think of it as picking
features to have in stable.

Take a look at Junio's blog posts about this topic.

That looks a bit like reimplementation of cherry-picking.

Also, I think you would loose the ability to run git-bisect to find
bad commits.

Reiterationg: if you are using topic branches, use topic-branch workflow.
