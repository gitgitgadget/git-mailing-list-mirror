Ah, I can finally see what are you talking about...  Thank you very much 
for all the testing you've performed and for supplying this screen 
recording!  I can confirm that my environment is also affected, but for 
some reason I haven't observed it this way before.

Huh, that's really worrisome and I'm willing to help you with debugging 
and fixing this issue.  Please, let me perform some debugging and 
digging around, and I'll come back to you with some further insights,

Those people, just as anyone else, can use $PAGER or $GIT_PAGER to 
configure the pagination the way they like it.  In the end, that's also 
what I do in my environment.

Well, yes and no.  This scrolling-related issue is obviously affecting 
numerous git users, which makes it quite relevant for git as a project.  
Of course, not directly relevant, but indirectly, yes.
