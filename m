  Translation:  "I feel that I am superior to other people.  This post has no
content apart from me shooting my mouth off in an attempt to prove how much
cleverer I am than anyone else.  However apart from my self-love I have no
contribution to make to the discussion."

  This isn't slashdot.  A computer is just a tool, and it's really *you* who
are being pathetic, because you confuse a choice of mass-manufactured consumer
product with a statement about personal identity.  Loyalty to your favourite
brand is a game of one-upmanship suitable only for kids.  You need to grow up.

    cheers,
