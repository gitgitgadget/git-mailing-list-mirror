I don't think it does any parallel work.

Here is the timing again from my previous email:

  960.50user 22.59system 16:23.74elapsed 99%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 1606156maxresident)k

Notice that 16:23 is 983s, and that it matches the sum of the user and
system times.  I usually saw this kind of timing with CPU-intensive
single-threaded programs, and if there were any parallelization, then I
would expect the elapsed time to be at least somewhat smaller than the
other two.

I have just gave it a try, but the v1.0.0 on Travis CI errored out with
"unknown option `-j'.
