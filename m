Part of my view (of the multiplicity of descriptives within Git)
regarding what is in a repository is from comparing the git created
content from a clone, that of a `git init`, and a users overall project
and .git trees after multiple interactions. Each has different features.

My main point was that there is this creative tension between the
different contexts and that beginners should be aware that it's not all
cut and dried in the same way that language definitions tend to be.
