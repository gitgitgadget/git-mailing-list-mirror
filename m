Good day!

So, git is unable to use this type of patches directly and I will
need to do
$ patch < patchfile
$ rm file.orig
$ git commit

Just wondering what is bad with the diffs without leading a/ and b/.

I've just realized that I need git because I need disconnected
commits. That's why I left my beloved SVN and started to hack GIT ;))

By the way, I am missing one thing: the Id keyword in the file. The
problem is that when some user is telling me: there is a bug in the
function a() that is inside the file b.c, then I can ask him to
give me the $Id$ tag of the file and I will have the full information
about the file version. Can I have it with git if user has just the
sources without any signs of the file versions? I've glanced over
the git manual, but was unable to find anything usable.

Not incovinient to install git, but it was just convinient to me to
use FreeBSD port. The other way round ;))
