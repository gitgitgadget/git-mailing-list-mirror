Hmm, yeah, I could perhaps buy that line of argument. Though it's
possible they are "warnings" of the sort that should still be emitted
with "--quiet"; really only the server knows. And note that even "reject
the push" is not necessarily all-or-nothing. The server may accept some
subset of the refs.

But...

Yes, this is a problem. Those messages are streamed out as we receive
them from the server, and before we get any status report back. I don't
think we'd want to buffer them, as they can be arbitrarily large (and
may even be progress reports that are meant to be shown in real-time).
