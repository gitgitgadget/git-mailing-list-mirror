(Then again, after a moment of thought, I'm not sure about the actual
scale of the event - if it's just a short thing for a day or two, a trip
from Europe probably does not make much sense. But if we could think up
enough for four days of fun, it would be probably worth it.)

Didn't Johannes mention that he will be in US in October?
