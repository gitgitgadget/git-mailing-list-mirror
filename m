Cool. I think the lack of this is what made me drag my feet on the first
patch. Thanks for finishing it off.

I wondered if other callers would be happy with init_tree_desc_gently().
Grepping for init_tree_desc(), it seems like it would be a fairly
trivial conversion for most of them, because they almost invariably run
unpack_trees() right afterwards, and so have to deal with errors from
it.

So perhaps in the long run we can convert them all. But certainly that
does not need to be part of this series.

This needs the same $TEST_DIRECTORY treatment as t1007.

I'd also expect these to be test_i18ngrep, but I see that t1450 is quite
bad about this in general. I'm OK with adding them as greps and leaving
a conversion of the whole script until later.

Yikes. :)

I wonder if some printfs, similar to what I showed in the last patch,
combined with "hash-object --literally", could make these tests more
readable and avoid the binary goo.

I know we used the "err" strbuf pattern in the ref code, and it makes
sense there where we have a lot of different functions with public
interfaces. But here, we literally just feed the result to die() or
warning(). I wonder if a nicer interface would be:

  typedef void (*err_fn)(const char *, ...);

  static int decode_tree_entry(struct tree_desc *desc,
                               const char *buf, unsigned long size,
			       err_fn err)
  {
         ...
         if (size < 23 || buf[size - 21]) {
	        err("too-short tree object");
		return -1;
	 }
  }

I dunno. Maybe that is overengineering. I guess we only hit the strbufs
in the error path (which used to die!), so nobody really cares that much
about the extra allocation.

I also wonder if this ought to be "error()" and not "warning()". I think
it's pretty common for fsck to spit out errors from sub-code but keep going.
