git-mergetool spawns an enormous amount of processes. For this reason,
the test script, t7610, is exceptionally slow, in particular, on
Windows. Most of the processes are invocations of git. There are
also some that can be replaced with shell builtins.

I've measured the number of processes and the number of
non-git commands invoked with

  strace -e execve,clone -f -o /tmp/git.strace ./t7610-mergetool.sh
  # processes:
  grep 'stack=NULL' /tmp/git.strace | wc -l
  # non-git commands:
  grep 'execve(' /tmp/git.strace | grep -v 'execve(".home' | wc -l

          non-git
processes commands

13645     3082    t7610-mergetool: use test_cmp instead of test $(cat file) = $txt

11542     2007    mergetool: use shell variable magic instead of `awk`

Notes on v2:
- Followed GÃ¡bor's suggestion to transform test ($cat ..) = txt
  (new patch 2).  It does not help a lot, but neither does
  patch 1, the pipe-in-subshell conversion.  Both are foremost
  clean-ups.
- Commit message tweaks; see below.
- Did not include measurement results in the commit messages, because
  I would have to repeat the measurement method every time.
