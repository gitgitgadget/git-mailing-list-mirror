The dashed form of the built-ins is so pass√©.

Incidentally, this also handles the .pdb issue in MSVC's install Makefile
target that Peff pointed out in the context of the "slimming down" patch
series
[https://lore.kernel.org/git/20200813145719.GA891370@coredump.intra.peff.net/]
.

This addresses https://github.com/gitgitgadget/git/issues/406

Changes since v2:

 * Reworded and clarified the commit messages of the second and third patch.

Changes since v1:

 * Fixed check-docs under SKIP_DASHED_BUILT_INS
 * Renamed ALL_PROGRAMS_AND_BUILT_INS to ALL_COMMANDS_TO_INSTALL to reflect
   its purpose better.
 * Revamped the commit message of patch 2/3 and 3/3.

Johannes Schindelin (3):
  msvc: copy the correct `.pdb` files in the Makefile target `install`
  Optionally skip linking/copying the built-ins
  ci: stop linking built-ins to the dashed versions
