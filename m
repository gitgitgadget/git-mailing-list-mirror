That would be better to me. I still don't love it, but I admit it's
coming more from a knee-jerk response than from some rational argument
against people knowing I run Linux.

Since HTTP user-agent fields are common, we can look at those for prior
art. curl sends its own version but nothing else. Most browsers do seem
to include some OS information. My version of firefox gives its own
version along with "Linux x86_64". So basically "uname -sm".

Yes, I think we should definitely have an option to suppress or override
it, just like we do for the user-agent string.
