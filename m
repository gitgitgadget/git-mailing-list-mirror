Hi Matthieu and to all developers,
I'm Fabio, no more a student and I'm brand new in community
development. I joined the git mailing-list about two weeks ago and I'm
looking for some first fix or tasks. I apologize myself in advance for
my little know of the subject.  Hope to have some useful information to
start workin'.
Thank you in advance
Fabio.
