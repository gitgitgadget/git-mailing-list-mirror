ENOUGH ALREADY!

Yes, you are flaming.  You sent easily over 30 totally useless mails in 
this thread.  Over a couple of days.

And Martin is right, in that same amount of time, you could have learnt 
the internals of git _easily_.  Especially since I provided an own chapter 
in the manual for people like you.

So instead of _PESTERING_ us with things that we do _NOT CARE_ about, you 
could _DO SOMETHING USEFUL_ instead.

For example, read up that chapter, and not type any _POINTLESS_ mails in 
that _UTTERLY POINTLESS_ thread anymore.

I hoped that subtle _HINTS_ would give you an _IDEA_, but _EVIDENTLY_ I 
have to use _ALL-CAPS_ on you.

So _EITHER_ read up _OR_ go away, but _DO NOT BOTHER_ to post _ANY_ 
response without patches in this _DARNED_ thread.

Sheesh,
Dscho
