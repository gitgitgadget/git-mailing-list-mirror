Sure, if you make the buffering behavior dependent on the presence of
"-q". I guess that is not that hard to do, but it does increase the
complexity of the code (you have both a streaming and a buffering code
path).

Anyway, I am not all that convinced this is a fruitful path versus just
fixing the server side. But if you want to look into writing a patch, go
for it.
