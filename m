I don't think there's currently a way to turn off the rfc2047 from
within format-patch. You can generate a single patch with the same
format using:

  git log -1 -p --stat --summary \
    --pretty=3Dtformat:'From: %an <%ae>%nDate: %aD%nSubject: [PATCH] %s=
%n%n%b'

but it won't do nice things like putting one patch in each file.

Probably it would make sense for format-patch to have an option to
indicate that you are going to inline these patches into a different
MUA. So drop the 'From' mbox header line, don't rfc2047 encode, and
maybe some other behaviors. I do the same thing (including inline in
mutt), but I just delete the unwanted lines manually, and fortunately m=
y
name doesn't contain any non-ascii characters. ;)
