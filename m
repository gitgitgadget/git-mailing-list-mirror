  uh ... i just popped over to that python.org discussion, and it does
not even *remotely* resemble what you describe. the gist of that
discussion is that most people seem opposed to a sweeping change, and
are annoyed about all the bandwidth that was wasted by one person
harping about this.

  based on what i read at that link, python has in no way "taken a
stance," so i'm calling you on your rather egregious misrepresentation
of what happened there.
