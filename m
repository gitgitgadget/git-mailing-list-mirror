You still consider everybody who does not share your point of view an
idiot.  And telling people that is not going to change their mind.  You
need to come up with an argument that convinces anybody, and "the
designers are smart people, they must have thought something smart even
though I don't actually get it myself" does not convince anybody.  And
that has been your main argument.

And you consider others dense for not accepting it?
