Isn't it pointless to ask such a generic question? Users are always welcome
to post suggestions on the mailing list. Maybe the survey should encourage
to do so.

But for the survey itself, which people don't usually have a lot of time to
spend on, I think a specific question is much more inspiring. For example,

	"Which feature would you like to see added to git? Feel free to
	ignore technical restrictions."

I think we had something like that last year, didn't we?
