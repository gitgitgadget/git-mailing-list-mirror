It can also just be a quoted string, which likewise has no limit defined
in that section. That's what we send for LOGIN (you have to go back to
the imap_exec() command which uses a format string). It also looks like
that would barf completely on a username or password that contains a
double-quote. Yup:

  $ git format-patch -1 --stdout |
    git -c imap.user='my"user"' -c imap.pass=foo imap-send --no-curl
  [...]
  IMAP command 'LOGIN <user> <pass>' returned response (BAD) - Invalid characters in atom
  IMAP error: LOGIN failed

Oh, I forgot we had xstrvfmt(). That would obviously be the right match.

Yeah, I think all of the data here is user controlled. Even if you
didn't trust the patch itself, this is all username, mailbox name, etc.

Heh.
