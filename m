(CC-ing the Git mailing list)

It's great that you've translated it, I'm not sure where this should
be linked from in Git's documentation, if at all.

I'm currently working no getting i18n support for Git's core commands
up and running, after that I wanted to try getting support for
http://po4a.alioth.debian.org/ going.

That we way could translate any of our documentation and ship it as
part of Git itself, so you could have a Russian gittutorial manpage
installed along with Git.
