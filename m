Sadly, no. Microsoft's qsort_s() is not compatible with the ISO C one.
And BSD's qsort_r() has a similar problem acting as a wrapper, because
the order of arguments in the callback functions is different (so you'd
have to actually wrap the callback, too, and rearrange the arguments for
each call, or do some macro trickery).

Gory details are in:
