 Imagine that this is bigger and moreover, stays big forever! A month or less will pass, and you will forget what it feels like to doubt your size and performance.

 Just show her how big it is, and she will forget everybody she met before. Expect an explosion in your intimate life very soon - guaranteed! Just take a look: http://www.caseyjul.com/gall/ms/ 
Just imagine how wonderful your life would become with a bigger size and increased duration.


 Admiration is the daughter of ignorance  Middle age is when broadness of the mind and narrowness of the waist change places  A good tree brings forth good fruit. Fight fire with fire A watched pot never boils. A Growing Youth Has a Wolf in His Belly.
