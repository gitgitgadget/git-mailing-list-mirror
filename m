That sounds like a nice change.

Part of my reasoning for "fail if you can't find it" was that it was 
highly likely to be a user error.  Especially because it will fail for a 
short hash from a file.  If you do have a list of commits to ignore 
(.git-blame-ignore-revs), that list is probably under version control in 
the same git repo, so it should change as you change branches.

But all in all, I'm fine with skipping unknown objects.  Or for warning 
or having a git-config option, like we do for a couple other aspects of 
blame-ignore, since one size doesn't fit all.

Any performance improvement would be welcome.  I haven't looked at the 
code in a while, but I don't recall any reasons why this wouldn't work.

I don't recall exactly.  Someone on the list might have wanted to both 
counter the blame.ignoreRevsFile and specify another file.  Or maybe 
they just wanted to counter the ignoreRevsFile, and I didn't know that 
--no- would already do that.  I'm certainly not wed to it.

Thanks,
