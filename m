Cool.

I definitely like the separate script approach.  Not sure if you read my
posts, your PoC seems inline with my thoughts on handling externals be
seen here:

git svn clone -r<latest_revision_number> URL should work if you extract
the revision number easily.  Specifying "-rHEAD" will only work if the
branch of the external you're tracking was the last modified revision in
the repository, so it's not very useful.  "svn log" seems to have the
same semantics as git-svn as far as -rHEAD being useful or not...

I'm not sure if mapping submodules to externals is a good idea
because externals don't require exact revisions and submodules do.
There's also an issue I was just made aware of two days ago with
submodules and git-svn that I haven't had time to work on.

Another user also privately reported a bug to me about git-svn having
trouble dcommitting when using submodules.  I've attached the test case
here in case you have any thoughts on how to handle this (I think the
easiest would be to ignore submodules on dcommit entirely).

Also some small portability issues: "grep -q" is definitely unportable
in my experience.  There are probably some more that I am missing my eye
at this time of night...
