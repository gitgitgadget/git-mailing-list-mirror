I was planning to be there. I like lca, but passed it over this year
because of it being in Canberra (I'm sure it's a nice city to live in, but
it's not a very exciting one, and I've been there several times before ;)

I'm no good with papers, though. One of the reasons I decided to leave the 
university lifestyle was that I hate writing papers. That's 
anti-conductive to being at a uni ;)
