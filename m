Good catch!  Yes, the size field is unguarded.  The only references to
it that I found were used in _add() and _remove() in the need-to-rehash
check.

Since auto-rehash is turned off, this shouldn't be a problem, but it
does feel odd to have a possibly incorrect size due to races.

Rather than adding something like (a cross-platform version of)
InterlockedIncrement(), I'm wondering if it would be better to
disable/invalidate the size field when auto-rehash is turned off
so we don't have to worry about it.

Something like this:
