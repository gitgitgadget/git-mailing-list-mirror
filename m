Are there any EL5 RPMs available for Git 1.6.0 or greater?    The current 
EL5 repo rpm for git-1.5.5.6 is apparently relatively outdated in the git 
timeline.  My team is new to git and to linux and are hoping to learn the 
newer version of git without having to first ascend the learning curve of 
compiling git.  We are hoping that other el5 git users before us have 
created git 1.6.0+ rpms for their own use.  Is it correct to assume that an 
el5 rpm created by someone else can also be installed on our RHEL 5.2+ box?

v/r,
Neal
