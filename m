This push step is rewriting your upstream config. Do you have
push.autoSetupRemote configured? In general you wouldn't want that for a
triangular flow.

Though I think it also is only supposed to kick in if there is no
tracking configured already. Why did the "git switch" invocation not set
up tracking itself? When I run those commands it does. Do you have
branch.autoSetupMerge turned off in your config?
