Google accepted our application to GSoC '07.  Thanks to everyone
who helped with reviewing the application, and most of of all thanks
to our volunteer mentors!


Small catch though: I didn't find this clause earlier when I setup
the application, but reading through the Terms of Service for the
program I found this:

  10. All necessary tax forms or other tax related documentation
  required to provide payment to the organization

Yea... we as an organization get $500.00 USD for each student
that particpiates:

Small fun fact that I did not previously realize.  Apparently there
might be some complications from being a GSoC project, as we don't
legally exist as an organization in any locality.  And there's of
course the question about what to do with the money we receive.

I figure we'll probably get 1, maybe 2 slots, which means about
$500-$1000 USD.
