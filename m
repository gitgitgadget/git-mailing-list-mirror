I wondered how that would impact the error message when there is no such
stash. It looks like rev-parse will still return the bogus name on
stdout, so we do not run afoul of the "No stash found" code path. We do
get:

  $ git.compile stash show foobar
  foobar is not a valid reference

instead of:

  $ git stash show foobar
  fatal: ambiguous argument 'foobar': unknown revision or path not in
  the working tree.
  Use '--' to separate paths from revisions, like this:
  'git <command> [<revision>...] -- [<file>...]'

But I do not see that as a big downside (I might even call it an
improvement).
