Something like the below on top of this series (then rebased). (The last
hunk below is a revert of this patch.)

I'd like to think of the situation before this patch above as a
situation where the API promises something and the user uses the API
beyond that. The next patch in this series changes the internals of the
API in a way that is consistent with the promise made, but which ends up
affecting an over-eager user.

What this patch above does is to make the user do what the API promise
allows them to do, i.e., no more shortcuts. What you're saying is, why
isn't the promise stronger? So the user won't have to think as much?

So in particular, why doesn't `clear...()` and the error path in
`read_...()` impose sane, usable defaults? My first concern is that it
means we need to make a stronger promise, which might then be hard to
back away from, if we want to. Maybe we'll never want to...

My second concern is, what should we be falling back to, going forward?
At some point, the hash indicated by `REPOSITORY_FORMAT_INIT` will be
SHA-256. Before that, and as soon as we support both hashes, what if we
pick up SHA-256 before stumbling on some other piece of the config --
should we now reset the struct to indicate SHA-1, or rather keep the
SHA-256 value, which by itself is valid? (The same could be argued now,
for something other than hash functions, but the SHA-1/256 example might
be more obvious in the context of this patch.)

My third worry is that we should then equip `clear_...()` or at least
the error path of `read_...()` with some logic to keep "as much as
possible" of what we've picked up and reset the rest, all the while
making sure we don't end up with something self-contradicting or stupid.
After all, we'll have promised the users that they can ignore any errors
and just run ahead.

Maybe I'm worrying way too much, and I shouldn't be so afraid of making
a stronger promise here and now because of vague slippery-slope thinking.

Thanks for pushing back and forcing me to articulate my thinking.

Martin
