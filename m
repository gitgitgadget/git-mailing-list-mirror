Yes, the original subject line was "... when using the ALLOC_GROW macro",
but vim scolded me for busting the line length. I tried several other
variations, but I couldn't come up with anything better.

So, yes, given that the subject left a little to be desired, I probably
should have included a commit message body. :(

[This patch was originally written years ago, as part of a much larger
series to fix all -Wextra warnings. I was pleasantly surprised that it
applied to master without conflicts. However, I had to add to the patch
because new instances of -Wsign-compare due to using the ALLOC_GROW macro
had appeared since then.]

Hmm, I did consider splitting this patch up, so that this (and other
issues you mention below) could be called out separately, but well ... ;-)

Yes, I agree. If I had split this patch up, I would have considered
adding such modifications to that patch. (That's easy to say now, of
course!)

Indeed, ... :-P

Thanks for the detailed review.
