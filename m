While I think it is a great thing to have Git contributors so close to Git
users every year, I could imagine that a good compromise would be to have
a Git Contributor Summit the day before GitMerge, as we already have it,
and then roughly half a year later an "online-only" Virtual Summit.

It was great. It was truly great. Thanks again for letting me do that!

Speaking from personal experience in my day job, I agree that it is easy
to have a discussion with a few remotes when you have only 5-10 team
members, and it gets pretty difficult when there are 20-30 people or more.

However, I found that those problems are rooted more in lack of
discipline, such as the people with physical presence simply talking over
the remote ones, seemingly without noticing what they are doing there.

Having said that, I believe that we core contributors can learn to have a
fruitful online meeting. With 30+ participants, too.

Learning from my past life in academia (it is hard for me to imagine a
less disciplined crowd than a bunch of white, male, old scientists), we
would need a moderator, and some forum that allows to "give somebody the
mic". That software/platform should exist somewhere.

Indeed. That part is almost lost online. But not quite.

I would love to have the best of both worlds. For example, it is an annual
annoyance that we are discussion all kinds of things regarding Git, trying
to steer the direction, to form collaborations on certain features, and
the person at the helm is not even there.

Maybe *two* meetings per year, one attached to GitMerge, and one purely
online, would help.

Point in favor of the pure-online meeting: the informal standup on IRC
every second Friday. I really try to attend it (it is a bit awkward
because it is on a Friday evening in my timezone, right at the time when I
want to unwind from the work week), as it does have a similar effect to
in-person standups: surprising collaborations spring up, unexpected help,
and a general sense of belonging.

Of course, the value of these standups comes from the makeup of the
participants: Stefan, Brandon, Stolee, JeffH, Jonathan and other *very*
active core contributors hang out for roughly half an hour, sharing what
they are working on, exchanging ideas, etc.

Such an online summit as I suggested above would really only work if
enough frequent contributors would attend. If enough people like you,
Junio, and the standup regulars would say: yep, we're willing to plan and
attend an online summit, where we try to have a timezone-friendly
"unconference"-style meeting on one day (on which we would of course try
to free ourselves from our regular work obligations).

I guess I am asking for a "raise your hands", with mine high up in the
air.

Ciao,
Dscho
