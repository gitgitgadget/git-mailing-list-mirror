Aside from issues with the clarity of the commit message, which I'll fix
& thanks for pointing them out. I think we may have stumbled on
something more important here.

Do you mean that you don't agree that following should always create
both "foo" and e.g. ".git/refs/heads/master" with the same 644
(-rw-rw-r--) mode:

    (
        rm -rf /tmp/repo &&
        umask 022 &&
        git init /tmp/repo &&
        cd /tmp/repo &&
        echo hi >foo &&
        git add foo &&
        git commit -m"first"
    )

To me what we should do with the standard umask and what
core.sharedRepository are for are completely different things.

We should in git be creating files such that if I set my umask to
e.g. 022 all users on the system can read what I'm creating.

E.g. I tend to use this on something like a production server where
others (if I'm asleep) might want to look at my .bash_history as a last
resort, and also some one-off repo I've created without setting
core.sharedRepository.

I've yet to run into a case where this doesn't just work, aside from
core.splitIndex where before the patch here we're using a tempfile API
for something that isn't a tempfile.

This is distinct from the core.sharedRepository use-case, where you'd
like to on a per-repo basis override what you'd otherwise get with the
umask. E.g. if you have a shared server hosting a shared git repo, where
users with umask 077 will still be forced to create e.g. group rw files.
