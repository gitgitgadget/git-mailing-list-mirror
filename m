As part of DebConf 8, I will talk about http://vcs-pkg.org in about
2 hours [0], and I intend to introduce TopGit, which was announced here
a week ago [1].

0. https://penta.debconf.org/dc8_schedule/events/233.en.html
1. http://marc.info/?l=3Dgit&m=3D121773329801376&w=3D2

If you want to tune in and participate via our video streams and IRC
channels, visit http://debconf8.debconf.org.

Please note that I am going into this talk with far less preparation
than I would have liked to do, and I don't claim to know TopGit very
well yet. I will make sure my audience knows this. But if anyone
with more of a clue is around on IRC, it would be helpful.

but please turn off the sound.
