Perhaps with a --squash option. I've already been wanting a
cherry-pick that accepts a range, but that makes separate commits.

Yes, I know there's some git-rebase thing that will do it, but I can
never remember the right syntax for that without studying the
documentation[*]. What I find myself wanting to type is just:

	git cherry-pick A..B

But there is the whole problem of how to deal with any conflict that
appears during the process.

-Carl

[*] I do use one form of rebase without ever needing to consult the
documentation, but it's in the opposite "direction", if you will, from
the cherry-pick-a-range operation. I use it when I want to rebase a
set of commits from my current branch to some other branch, such as:

	git rebase origin

Not surprisingly, what's common about both of the operations above is
that they are really only accepting a single argument, (a range in one
case, and a branch-name in the other). That's what makes for an
easy-to-use command. Things that require multiple branch names in a
particular order, or extra options, (see "git rebase --onto newbase
upstream branch"), need someone smarter than me to drive them.

Another problem is that using the optional final [<branch>] argument
to git-rebase makes it change the current branch, (which no other
git-rebase operation does), and that's another thing I find very
confusing.

I'm sure the most complex form of git-rebase solves some precise
problem that someone has, (and maybe even gets used regularly). But
it's got enough complications that I just ignore it, (and would
instead really prefer being able to just cherry-pick a whole range).
