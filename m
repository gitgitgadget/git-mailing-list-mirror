I dunno. I guess you are thinking of the case where somebody adds a new
caller but fails to invoke Git correctly. Which would be a bug in the
test script.

But it could also easily be due to Git changing how it behaves in a
certain circumstance. And maybe the solution is changing the test to
adapt, or maybe we just found a bug in Git.

TBH, I do not care that much either way. Either way, I think somebody
would notice the problem.
