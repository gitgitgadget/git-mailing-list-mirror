Hmm, yeah. On the config side, git_trailer_default_config() issues a
warning after the functions return -1. I'd have guessed we at least
printed a usage message or something here, but we don't even do that.
You get a silent 129 exit code.

Gross, but it's something I think we should fix separately, as it's
orthogonal to this series.

I don't have a strong opinion. It is sometimes nice to provide more
detail to save the user having to look it up separately. But sometimes
those details can be overwhelming and make it hard to read, especially
if they grow over time. I'm thinking less of "-h" output and more of
people like to put:

  git foo [--optionA|--optionB|--optionC]

and so on, until eventually the options block is like 4 lines long. Just
saying [options] and then listing them is more friendly. I'm not sure if
we're approaching that kind of problem here or not.
