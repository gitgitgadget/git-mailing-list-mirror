I do not like the implication that Git eats trees.

I also do not like that the link to "Documentation" looks more like a 
too-short cheat-sheet.

My first reaction was: he could have given Pasky a little more time to 
react.

But then, I think that git.or.cz looks more professional (read: more 
respectful, less geekish), so I think there is not much harm in that.
