Have you tried using a pre-push hook? It looks like it is exactly what 
you need:

   pre-push
     This hook is called by git-push(1) and can be used to prevent a 
     push from taking place. The hook is called with two parameters 
     which provide the name and location of the destination remote, if a 
     named remote is not being used both values will be the same.

     Information about what is to be pushed is provided on the hookâ€™s 
     standard input with lines of the form:

         <local ref> SP <local sha1> SP <remote ref> SP <remote sha1> LF

     For instance, if the command git push origin master:foreign were 
     run the hook would receive a line like the following:

         refs/heads/master 67890 refs/heads/foreign 12345

     although the full, 40-character SHA-1s would be supplied. If the 
     foreign ref does not yet exist the <remote SHA-1> will be 40 0. If 
     a ref is to be deleted, the <local ref> will be supplied as
     (delete) and the <local SHA-1> will be 40 0. If the local commit 
     was specified by something other than a name which could be 
     expanded (such as HEAD~, or a SHA-1) it will be supplied as it was 
     originally given.

     If this hook exits with a non-zero status, git push will abort 
     without pushing anything. Information about why the push is 
     rejected may be sent to the user by writing to standard error.
