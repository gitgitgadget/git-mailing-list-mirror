Not that dissimilar to "my neighbour beats his wife, so I do too"...

That little nitpick aside, you've completely avoided

Ok, so some users are allowed links on their user page and some are
not. The point I was trying to drive home, which I think you may have
possibly missed, is that nowhere on the Git wiki does it say that user
pages cannot be used in such a way. Nor is there any mention that
using *enabled* features such as reaching an admin via their talk page
will get them banned for life.

Then why aren't these features disabled, if using them will result in
an infinite ban (which is a little bit too strong, no?) from the Git
wiki?
