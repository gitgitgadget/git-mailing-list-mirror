Yeah, I'd agree with that.

I'm OK with those arguments, too. :)

Agreed. But I think that is mostly the case (asciidoctor seems no harder
to acquire on most modern systems than asciidoc; there are system
packages in most cases, and decent binary-package systems for both ruby
and python if you really need it).

It does create a situation where people like Randall on NonStop might
need to do part of their dev work on another, more mainstream platform.
But I suspect that is already the case.

That does make things a little less convenient; Debian stable, for
instance, still has 1.5.8. It's not too hard to install an updated gem,
but not quite as nice as using the system package (it also makes things
weird for building the stable Debian package itself, which would want to
rely only on other packages; but of course any proposed change to the
doc toolchain would be for new versions, and would not get backported
there anyway).

I'm unclear when support for python asciidoc goes away here. Is it part
of step 6 (because it does not have another way of generating them)? Or
does it live on forever as a non-default legacy system? I'd prefer not,
but as long as we are clear about the primary target and leave it up to
people interested in the legacy to do the compat fixes, that might be
OK.
