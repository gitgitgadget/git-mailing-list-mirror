Scott Chacon was looking into it, but the last I heard he was having
trouble finding a good venue in Berlin in late October (a lot of places
he was trying were booked). I don't know there that's at; he's actually
been on vacation for the past week or two, so I'm hoping to hear
something soon.

I'm not sure if this planning delay will bump the date back a little.
But nobody is talking because nobody knows yet what is going on or when,
and something will eventually happen. I will keep poking at Scott until
it does.
