Does anyone have a link to that git training video Linus made *after* the 
Google Tech Talk?  In that second video, part of the slideshow was outside 
the frame so it was only partially readable.  Nevertheless, he explained 
very interesting things like how to review how your merge auto-merged 
same-file edits that didn't conflict.

v/r,
neal
