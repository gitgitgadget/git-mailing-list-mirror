It's not necessarily an outright programming mistake, and that error
could be triggered by ordinary users as well.

Let's suppose that a user has a custom 'git-foo' command in $PATH with
a custom '_git_foo' completion function in '~/.my-git-completions',
which the helper function '__git_bar --option' from our completion
script.  Let's also suppose that the user sources this completion
function from '~/.bashrc', but otherwise uses the system-wide git
completion script, and that $HOME is shared across multiple computers.

In this (arguably somewhat convoluted) scenario it might happen that
on a not quote up-to-date computer the system-wide git completion
script already has the '__git_bar' helper function, but it doesn't yet
support '--option'.  If '__git_bar' then prints an error to stderr,
then the command line will get badly messed up, and the user will have
to ctrl-C and start over.

However, if '__git_bar' silently ignores the unknown option, then the
worst that can happen is that completion doesn't work, and e.g. it
falls back to Bash's filename completion or offers something
nonsensical.  In either case, after a brief "Huh?!" moment the user
can correct it by hitting backspace a couple of times and then enter
the rest of the command by hand.
