Actually my motivation is worse than that in at least one of the cases
I am assuming Ram is referring to.

I don't think most bystanders would misunderstand if I let a certain
person alone instead of responding and saying "You are being
unproductive.  Please stop."  But that certain person seems to
misunderstand, whether I say that or not.  So when I lose patience I
say so, knowing that it will spark a discussion with others, knowing
that that discussion needs to happen and that if the problem is not
addressed I will continue to lose motivation for regular work on-list.

Is that an instance of taking offense and letting emotion overtake
reason?  Is that against the rules?
