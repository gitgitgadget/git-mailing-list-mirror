Hmm. Traditionally we did not send ERR as part of upload-pack at all. It
was the message you got from git-daemon if it couldn't start the
requested sub-process. It was only later in bdb31eada7 (upload-pack:
report "not our ref" to client, 2017-02-23) that we started sending
them. So I think that is why it does not check the error message: it is
not expecting that case at all (and it is not actually interesting here,
as the real problem is that the remote side is corrupt, but it sadly
does not say anything so useful).

I think that's somewhat tangential, though. The root of the issue is
this:

Right, as soon as we get SIGPIPE we can't offer any useful message,
because we're dead. I would argue that fetch should simply turn off
SIGPIPE entirely, and rely on getting EPIPE from write(). But since
we're in write_or_die(), it actually turns EPIPE back into a SIGPIPE
death!

So we'd probably also want to teach it to use a real write_in_full(),
and then output a more useful message in this case. write_or_die()
really does produce bad messages regardless, because it doesn't know
what it's writing to.

That would give us a baby step in the right direction, because at least
we'd always be doing a controlled die() then. And then the next step
would be to show the remote error message (even though it's not actually
useful in this case, in theory upload-pack could generate something
better). And that would mean turning the die() on write into an attempt
to drain any ERR messages before either dying or returning an error up
the stack.

I suspect the (largely untested) patch below would make your test
problems go away. Or instead, we could simply add sigpipe=ok to the
test_must_fail invocation, but I agree with you that the current
behavior on OS X is not ideal (the user sees no error message).
