Hi,

So I've decided to start using git for a few projects.

I've created an initial repository on my laptop, but want to create a 
"master" repo on a remote server via SSH.

Using Gitx as a gui client.

I have ssh setup, keys, etc.

Can someone help me with the next step of pushing my initial repo up to 
the server as version 1?

Thanks!
