Ah, right, I should have been able to figure that out myself. So scratch
that theory. My "hypervisor stalling our memory reads" theory is still
plausible, but I don't know how we would test it.

I guess in some sense it doesn't matter. If it's slower, we're not
likely to be able to fix that. So I guess we just need the fallback to
the current behavior.
