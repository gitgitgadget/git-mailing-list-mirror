To all contributors to test-lib.sh mentioned in Bcc:

You're getting this message because you're recorded as contributing one
or more changes to the test-lib.sh file in the Git project, and are
therefore one of many copyright holders in the file.

We would like to extend the license of that file from GPLv2 only
license to GPLv2+ by adding the recommended "or any later version"
clause to the license. This will give us license compatibility with
GPLv3 projects, which would like to reuse test-lib.sh.

Please respond to this email with one of the following:

 YES, I agree to relicense all my contributions to test-lib.sh to GPLv2+
 with the addition of the "or any later version" clause.

 NO, I would rather not, please send me more email to convince me.

I'm putting your address to Bcc as most people are probably not
interested in receiving responses from dozens of other people. I will
track the status of received responses at
https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Test-lib_reclicensing. Please do
not remove git@vger.kernel.org when responding so that your response is
available to everyone.

Thanks!
Michal Sojka
