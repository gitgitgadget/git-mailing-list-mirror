Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <git.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: git@vger.kernel.org

Some asciidoc formatting errors and some minor formatting inconsistencies in
hash-function-transition.txt were fixed.

Content-wise the rationale for choosing SHA-256 was shortened and moved to
the beginning of the document and an incomplete sentence was corrected.

Changes since v1:

 * Better commit messages.
 * Details on SHA-1 weaknesses were removed from the rationale.
 * All http links to lore.kernel.org in the tree were changed to https
   links.

Thanks to Ã†var for his suggestions and help.

     +    combined for that. Lastly for verbatim output a newline followed

       and safe error checking, but other hash functions are equally suitable
       that are believed to be cryptographically secure.
       
      +Choice of Hash
      +--------------
     -+The hash to replace the hardened SHA-1 should be stronger than SHA-1
     -+was: we would like it to be trustworthy and useful in practice for at
     -+least 10 years.
     -+
     -+Some other relevant properties:
     -+
     -+1. A 256-bit hash (long enough to match common security practice; not
     -+   excessively long to hurt performance and disk usage).
     -+
     -+2. High quality implementations should be widely available (e.g., in
     -+   OpenSSL and Apple CommonCrypto).
     -+
     -+3. The hash function's properties should match Git's needs (e.g. Git
     -+   requires collision and 2nd preimage resistance and does not require
     -+   length extension resistance).
     ++There were several contenders for a successor hash to SHA-1, including
     ++SHA-256, SHA-512/256, SHA-256x16, K12, and BLAKE2bp-256.
      +
     -+4. As a tiebreaker, the hash should be fast to compute (fortunately
     -+   many contenders are faster than SHA-1).
     ++In late 2018 the project picked SHA-256 as its successor hash.
      +
     -+We choose SHA-256.
     ++See 0ed8d8da374 (doc hash-function-transition: pick SHA-256 as
     ++NewHash, 2018-08-04) and numerous mailing list threads at the time,
