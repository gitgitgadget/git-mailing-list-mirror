I admit I overreacted without first seeing the extent of damage.
Sorry I made too big a fuss about this.

The 4/22 one I found very good and expected it to be in good
shape when finished.  I simply did not expect that to be taken
piecemeal like Petr did.  I overreacted, thinking he did so
_without_ considering much about possible conflicts.

The request to _continue_ using good judgements when to forewarn
people still stands ;-).  In this case, Petr used good
judgement.  My apologies to both of you if my knee-jerk reaction
caused you bad feelings.
