That's definitely odd. Some things I'd try:

  - do other versions of cat-file behave differently (i.e., is it a
    regression)?

  - what does "git rev-parse refs/heads/develop:path/to/parent/file"
    say? If it comes up with 4c8d566ed80, then the problem is cat-file
    specific. If not, then it's a problem in the name resolution
    routines.

  - likewise, what does "git cat-file -t cc10f4b27808" say? I'd expect
    it to really be a commit (a bug in batch-check's formatting routines
    could show the wrong object, but I'd expect the oid to at least
    match what ls-tree showed).

  - Is there anything odd about the tree? E.g., duplicate entries, out
    of order entries, etc? Examining "ls-tree" output might help, but
    "git fsck" should also note any irregularities.

After that, I'd probably start running "cat-file --batch-check" through
a debugger. I know you said you don't have access to the repository, but
perhaps whoever does might be willing to run it through "fast-export
--anonymize" and see if the bug persists?
