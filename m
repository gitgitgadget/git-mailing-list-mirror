Hi,
I'm not sure if this was already requested somewhere (a quick - but
admittedly not thorough - search did not reveal anything in that
direction), but I really miss an option to configure the prefixes generated
by `git commit (--fixup | --squash) <commit>` and picked up by `git rebase
-i --autosquash`.

My reasoning is that in our project we use GitHub + Travis to test-build
our pull requests, but we don't want to spam the CI server with builds that
are just fixups to previous changes (which are uploaded so reviewers can
track the changes to the original PR). Now, Travis has the option to not
build a commit if there is the string `[ci skip]` in the commit message
(sadly also not configurable) so it would be really great for my workflow
if I could just add this string to the message generated by `--fixup`.

Thanks in advance for your consideration.

Kind Regards,
Martine Lenders
