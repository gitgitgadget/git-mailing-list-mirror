Actually I totally disagree with this April 1st prank. That is, I totally agree
with the first 2 paragraphs of the letter. I think a Git company could be very
successful, and could help open-source. It could sell a closed source GUI that
competes with commercial SW in eye candy but kicks as by been so fast, as Git is.
It could sell closed source integration into the likes of Visual Studio. It could
sale support subscriptions for fixing bugs and adding fixtures according to 
costumers votes. It could integrate with a bug tracking system as one coherent whole.

There are 100s of ways to take such a company, and that market was always hot,
I wish I was a business men.
