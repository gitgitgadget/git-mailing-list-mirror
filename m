This adds a packed-object function, but I doubt anybody actually calls
it. If we're going to do that, it's probably worth adding some tests for
"cat-file --batch-check" or similar.

At which point I wonder if rather than having a function for a single
object, we are better off just testing the result of:

  git cat-file --batch-all-objects --unordered --batch-check='%(objectsize:disk)'

against a single post-processed "show-index" invocation.

I'm not sure that we need to do anything special with output
redirection. Shouldn't these functions just send errors to stderr as
usual? If they are run inside a test_expect block, that goes to
descriptor 4 (which is either /dev/null or the original stderr,
depending on whether "-v" was used).

OK. We lose the exit code from "rev-parse" but that is probably OK for
our purposes.

OK, this $end is the magic required for the final entry. Makes sense.

I was confused at first, because I didn't see any sorting happening. But
if I understand correctly, you're just looking for the smallest "end"
that comes after the start of the object we're looking for. Which I
think works.
