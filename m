I do not know about "cp -R", but surely "rsync" is used by Windows
users as well as users of Unix based systems, isn't it?

Probably.  The paths that are not deleted are certainly different
set of paths from those that are updated and/or added, so it sounds
like a reasonable thing to do.

I am afraid that "previously" may be taken too literally by readers
and misunderstood as paths that had been tracked even once in the
past.  

If you think that is worried too much because we can only delete
what is _currently_ in the index, and any past before what is in the
current index cannot ever affect the outcome, the same reasoning
tells me that the original is clear enough without "previously",
i.e. "tracked ones not present in..." are the ones that are in the
index currently, but the tree that we are taking new contents from
does not have them.

I dunno.
