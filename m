Hang on, hang on. This is either a compiler bug, or you're wrong on your 
assumption about the specification of qsort.

Either way, the extra layer of indirection is not proper protection. The 
unwanted compiler optimisation you're inadvertently triggering could 
still be triggered through the inline.

Now, looking at the C standard, this isn't actually clear to me. The 
standard says that if you call qsort with nmemb zero, the pointer still 
has to be "valid". Not totally clear to me if NULL is valid, by their 
definition in C99 7.1.4. Googling hasn't given me a concrete answer.

The compiler seems to think that NULL wouldn't be valid, so because 
you've called qsort on it, you've invoked undefined behaviour if it's 
NULL, so it's free to elide the NULL check.
