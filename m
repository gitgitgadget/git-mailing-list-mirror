Great.

I would like to translate it into Vietnamese (with xml2po). Can you
please do me a favor making "Git Cheat Sheet" at the top left a
continuous string?  Also it would be great if the text "the curves
indicate..."  is a continuous paragraph. I have no idea if it can be
achieved with inkscape/svg though.

Thank you.
