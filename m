Thanks both Christian and Ã†var for giving more details on your
situations elsewhere in the thread. I do think neither of you is quite
in the "I just do this in my spare time" situation. But I also think
that situation is going to be inversely correlated with being active in
the project and wanting to spend time on governance stuff. So IMHO some
compromise there is necessary. And I feel like both of you can represent
those interests, even if they're not exactly the situation you're in.

So what next?

There was a little bit of off-list discussion (mostly nominations to
avoid putting the candidate on the spot), but no new public candidates.
I'm happy to entertain more discussion here, but it seems like everybody
is reasonably happy with these two names.

So either Junio and I can pick one, or possibly we could have both (that
gives us a 4-person committee, but again, tied votes haven't been an
issue so far).

Any final thoughts are welcome.

Also, on a more meta-level, I'm happy to hear any thoughts about this
process that we might want to enshrine for later iterations. This is
obviously not nearly as formal as something like Debian elections. But I
don't think we're a big enough community to need that. So my attempt is
to just keep things informal, but try to give as many opportunities as
possible for people to speak up.
