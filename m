Junio, greetings.

Have you written anything up that tells people how you manage the git
project?  Something that could be used by other project leaders?  I've
been googling and haven't been able to find anything other than
documents which describe the process from the other side (people
submitting patches).

A lot can be gleaned by looking at it from the patch-submitter side,
but I'm guessing there are lots of little tips that project leads
could learn from by seeing a document on the process you use.  For
example, do you have a script that generates the "what's cooking
in..." emails?

Thanks!

Kevin
