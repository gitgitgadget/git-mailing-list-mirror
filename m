I'm a little mixed on this one. This _is_ a much better test of how the
two features should be have together. But I think the reason the
original was so short was that it was added when fixing a bug where we'd
iterate off the beginning of list of lines, which now no longer happens.

Maybe we should cover both cases in two separate tests?

I'd also suggest using "a b c" for the first three lines to avoid
confusion (I don't think it's important that they're the same as the
lines inside the "function").
