I might be interested in this, but why the web forum format?  Why not 
just set up a git-users mailing list instead?  Archive it on the web if 
you want, but a mailing list is more suited to this kind of thing.. or 
better yet a newsgroup.  I usually read my mailing lists through gmane's 
NNTP server anyway (like this one).
