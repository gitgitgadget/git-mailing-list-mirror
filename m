So, you are not only a newbie, but you have to unlearn some CVS 
braindamage.

I don't know how to make it even more prominent that CVS users should read 
a special introduction first. AFAICT such a hint is in all the appropriate 
places. (I mean, you would not expect to be able to fly a plane, just 
because you have learnt to drive a car, wouldn't you?)

Ciao,
