In cases like this some seem to think it's actually required:

	"Use a hyphen to connect two or more words functioning together
	as an adjective before a noun."

(From p. 234 of "A Writer's Reference", 3rd ed., Diana Hacker--just what
I happen to have on my shelf.) I suppose it's there to help find the
modified noun when you're constructing modifiers out of multiple words
that aren't necessarily adjectives.

But whatever, I've no real objection to the patch.

Nah, just curious.  "For" seems a little more precise in this case, so
fair enough.
