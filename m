I created thousands of worktrees only for stress-testing. The real
workload needs only a dozen of them. That still leads to hitting a
race condition occasionally and automation failure.

Creating a separate lock directory will probably work. The question is
when do you need to take the lock. Before adding a worktree, sure.
Before deleting it as well. The problem is that deleting a worktree
successfully without creating some broken state needs to exclude
processes that might add stuff in the worktree directory. How many
operations then do *not* need to take the lock?

Thanks
