No, the topo_levels commit-slab would be always populated when we write
a commit data chunk. The topo_level slab is a workaround for the fact
that we are trying to write two independent values (corrected commit
date offset, topological levels) but have one struct member to store them in
(data->generation).

If we are in a mixed-version environment, we could avoid initializing
the slab and fill the topological levels into data->generation instead,
but that's not how it is implemented right now.

I have extend the last paragraph to include write_commit_graph_context
as well as:

  So, let's add a pointer to struct commit_graph as well as struct
  write_commit_graph_context to the topological level commit-slab and
  populate it with topological levels while writing a commit-graph file.

It works accidentally.

Our decision to avoid the cost of initializing both
commit_graph_data->generation and commit_graph_data->graph_pos has
led to some unwieldy choices - the complexity of helper functions,
bypassing helper functions when writing a commit-graph file [1].

I want to re-visit how commit_graph_data slab is defined in a future series.

The pattern is: iterate over the commit-graph chain and assign a member
(here, topo_level and in the other patch, read_generation_data) a value
(the address of topo_level slab, 1/0 depending on whether it is a mixed
generation chain).

We could generalize this in a future series but I don't think it is
worthwhile.
