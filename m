FWIW, Johannes' use of "Well, that rather settles things, no?" in this
thread this didn't strike me as being rude or truly dismissive (even
though it's literally so).

It seemed more just a timely and to the point reminder that however fun
it is to talk about random feature X, someone's gotta do the work if
it's going to actually be implemented, and that the direction of git
development very much follows the whims of those doing the actual
hacking (perhaps more so than other projects).

[and I don't even have particularly thick skin, I think -- I'm often
very annoyed by brusqueness one sees on many developer mailing lists...]
