Basically, this is up to you. If you are interested in the project, you 
are likely having an idea what you want to use it for, and thus already 
know how you want to use it.

I do not want to discourage you, but I had very bad experience with 
somebody who wanted to do GSoC in parallel to something else.

Besides, there is no "half-a-GSoC".

Also, if you want to participate in GSoC, have a look at Bo Yang's 
application, which is very well researched and shows some initiative.

Ciao,
Johannes
