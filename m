Seriously, Dscho is serving as a wiki gardener as a volunteer, on his o=
wn time, for the good of the community. He is not being paid to do it, =
and in order for him to keep his daily gardening down to a few minutes'=
 work, it's quite reasonable of him to make rapid assessments of edits =
and then decide what to do about it.=20

Completely unknown stranger walks in (never posted to Git mailing list,=
 never submitted a patch) and the first thing he does is set up a user =
page with links back to his own site, which happen to be of a trollish =
nature. Dscho quite reasonably identifies it as likely spam, trolling o=
r otherwise undesirable content, and deletes and bans. I would have don=
e the same thing.

If the user in question really does have legit contributions to make, h=
e'll come here and ask about getting unbanned, which is what this guy d=
id, surprisingly. Having read the guy's blog post, however, I seriously=
 doubt that he has anything useful to add to the wiki. Let him contribu=
te something useful here first (ie. patches, or answering user question=
s) and he'll have proved himself to be something other than what he app=
ears to be (a troll).
