Hello,

this problem came up when I was editing vmlinux.lds.S in the kernel
tree.

because we have "vmlinux*" in the toplevel .gitignore in linus's tree,
all vmlinux.lds.S under arch/$(ARCH)/kernel/ is affected. for kernel,
it might as easier to remove "*" from the exp.  but I was wandering if
it's worth to have an expression for gitignore to handle "a regex for
the current dir only"?

comments?
