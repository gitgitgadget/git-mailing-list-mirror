Ah, I see what you mean now by "inline" in the other part of the thread.

Yes, I think this makes sense since there is no other reasonable caller
of the nth_midxed_pack_entry() helper (and its one caller is itself
trivial).

So we get to avoid the nth_midxed_object_oid() copy entirely. Very nice.

Compared to the code before your series, we still have an extra function
call to oidset_contains(), which will (in the common case) notice we
have no entries and immediately return. But I think that's getting into
pointless micro-optimization.
