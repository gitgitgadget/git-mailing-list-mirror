Hello Team,
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 We wish to use GITSCC plug-in with PowerBui=
lder for application source-control with GIT GUI,=20
We downloaded GitScc.msi setup file from PushOK website, unfortunately =
when file was downloaded and before we could initialize installation
Symantec Endpoint Protection reported the file to be infected was consi=
dered to be a potential security threat.
Our company security team has denied us from using the above plug-in.

We wish to know is there any alternative plug-in for PowerBuilder-GIT a=
vailable which is secure & safe and also you can suggest us to use it.
Request you to kindly revert and please advise on this matter, Thanks.

Thanks & Best Regards,
Ram Kunchur
Senior Software Engineer
