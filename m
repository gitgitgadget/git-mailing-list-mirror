Do the words "insufferable !@#$!%%$" mean anything to you?  I mean,
seriously, you are WELCOME TO SUBMIT A PATCH FOR THIS.  Do it!  Go
ahead, write it!  We would love to see it.  Fix things, make things
better!  Don't continue to whine and waste people's time.  ALL PATCHES
ARE INTRUSIVE.  JUST SUBMIT A PATCH!
