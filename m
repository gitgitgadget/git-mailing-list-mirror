Did it happen once or repeated? It is rather strange, that
one shoud not fail. Which OS it was?

There have been doubds that a random incoming signal can
trigger such a failure.

"sometimes" here means "for some kinds of fatal error
failure", there is nothing random in it.

Thanks, I'll try to fix it

Yes, it is a desired behavior. A failure is expected here,
and the failure does not show up as non-200 status, as
described above.
