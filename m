Can someone elaborate on this? AFAIK, notes have popped up on this list 
often enough that I'm convinced it would be a _really_ useful feature. The 
only drawback I was aware of, was the lack of an efficient implementation, 
but then Jeff comes out of the blue and posts some interesting numbers [1] 
a week or so ago. Does this mean there are no remaining obstacles?

Have fun!
