Because it's a members-only list. Like me, I'm sure many will get
annoyed enough to remember to remove it for further postings on the
subject. Those nonsensical "awaiting moderator approval" emails are
irritating noise, and since they're "To: me" and get a low spamrank
they go straight to the high-priority folder. Many others on this
list use similar filters as it's a neat way of dealing with several
high-volume mailing lists sanely.
