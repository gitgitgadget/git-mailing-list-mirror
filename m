Since the "!" aliases use system() (i.e. no argv, but a plain string as 
parameter), my patch already does that. It quotes the arguments properly.

You mean the programs that could be called via "!" aliases? Yes, that is 
right. And there is also the problem that you have to convert path names 
if you are working on Windows, because of this c:\&@!ยง$ braindamage.

However, in this case Junio's idea to use the shell to do the hard work is 
again an alternative:

	[alias]
		alex = !sh -c 'd:\program.exe $(cygpath -w "$1")'

FWIW I do not think that executing the shell from time to time is a big 
problem. It's only that I would like to get rid of the dependency on perl 
and bash for the plain Windows user, who will not dare to leave the gui 
into the command line jungle where there be bisons, yaccs and kills.

Ciao,
Dscho
