Yeah, I noticed that, too. It would be easy enough to add the extra
newline ourselves when printing the verbose output (quite a few of our
older tests don't start with a newline already, so it would be improving
them, too).

Alternatively, I considered adding a whole new helper function that
would skip the need to say "-" as the test body. And then it would
always know we were reading from the here-doc.

Yeah, I wondered about that, but didn't bother digging since the
solution is the same either way.

I wrote something very similar at first, before finding the printf trick
on Stack Overflow. I thought the indentation on what I wrote was too
ugly. :)

I don't have a strong preference, and certainly if one is more portable
than the other, we should choose that.

The main point of my email was just to say "do people even like the
concept/direction?"
