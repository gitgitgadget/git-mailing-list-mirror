Just some minor comments below, many of which are subjective
style-related observations, thus not necessarily actionable, but also
one or two legitimate questions.

On this project, we usually get the simple cases out of the way first,
which often reduces the indentation level, making the code easier to
digest at a glance. So, it would be typical to write this as:

    if (from != to)
        return -1
    if (src != dest)
        oidcpy(dest, src);
    return 0;

or even:

    if (from != to)
        return -1
    if (src == dest)
        return 0;
    oidcpy(dest, src);
    return 0;

This way, for instance, the reader doesn't get to the end of the
function and then have to scan backward to understand the condition of
the `return -1`.

Several comments...

Style: we usually reduce the noise level by dropping the extra parentheses:

    if (from == to || type == OBJ_BLOB)

Does this condition represent a programming error or a runtime error
triggerable by some input? If a programming error, then use BUG()
rather than die().

If a triggerable runtime error, then...

* start user-facing messages with lowercase rather than capitalized word

* make the user-facing message localizable so readers of other
languages can digest it

    die(_("refusing do-nothing object conversion"));

On the other hand, don't make BUG() messages localizable.

This function appears to be a mere skeleton at the moment, so it's
difficult to judge at this point whether you are using `outbuf` as a
bag of bytes or as a legitimate string container. If the latter, then
the API may be reasonable, but if you're using it as a bag-of-bytes,
then it feels like you're leaking an implementation detail into the
API.

s/Failed/failed/

For people trying to diagnose this problem, would it be helpful to
present more information about the failed conversion, such as object
type and perhaps even its OID?

I suppose the function name is pretty much self-explanatory to those
familiar with the underlying concepts, but it might still be helpful
to add a comment explaining what the function does.
