Current version would spin forever  and exhaust memory while 
attempting to sort all files from all revisions at once, until it
dies before even doing any real work.  This is especially noticeable 
when used on a big repository like the imported  bkcvs repo for the
Linux kernel.

This patch allows for batching the sort to put a bound on needed 
resources and making progress early, as well as including some small
cleanups.
