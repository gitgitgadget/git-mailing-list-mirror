(Hi, musl developers!  Read on for some information regarding what
began as a test failure during packaging of Git 2.7.3 that appears to
be related to musl's regexp library.)

We are using 2.7.3.  I will admit the version is a bit old, but it is
working on all other arches (and it took an inordinate amount of time
to spin up PowerPC - hooray for toolchain issues).

Guilty of this as well.  Sorry about that.  With the proper
invocation, I receive a success:


elaine trash directory.t7810-grep # git grep -G -F -P -E
"a\x{2b}b\x{2a}c" ab
error: cannot run less: No such file or directory
ab:a+b*c
elaine trash directory.t7810-grep # echo $?
0


Haven't managed to build less(1) for PowerPC yet, but it does seem to
work when quoted.  Yikes!

I am cc:ing in the musl development list to see what their thoughts are.

Thanks for the help so far; I really appreciate it.  Hopefully we can
resolve this in a way that makes musl and Git's test suite both more
correct, if necessary.

Happy new year!
