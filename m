versions could be an empty string_list. In that case, versions->items is
NULL, and we shouldn't be trying to perform pointer arithmetic with it (as
that results in undefined behaviour).

Moreover we only use the results of this calculation once when calling
QSORT. Therefore we choose to skip creating relevant_entries and call
QSORT directly with our manipulated pointers (but only if there's data
requiring sorting). This lets us avoid abusing the string_list API,
and saves us from having to explain why this abuse is OK.

Finally, an assertion is added to make sure that write_tree() is called
with a valid offset.

This issue has probably existed since:
  ee4012dcf9 (merge-ort: step 2 of tree writing -- function to create tree object, 2020-12-13)
But it only started occurring during tests since tests started using
merge-ort:
  f3b964a07e (Add testing with merge-ort merge strategy, 2021-03-20)

For reference - here's the original UBSAN commit that implemented this
check, it sounds like this behaviour isn't actually likely to cause any
issues (but we might as well fix it regardless):
https://reviews.llvm.org/D67122

    merge-ort: only do pointer arithmetic for non-empty lists
    
    V2 removes relevant_entries as per RenÃ©'s suggestion, and adds an
    assertion as per Junio's question.
