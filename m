Thanks for your response, Dscho. I was all set to reply to GÃ¡bor, but
you made all my points for me. :)

In particular, I think this paragraph is key. I don't think this CoC is
asking to change anything about how we work or communicate currently. I
view it as writing down the status quo (which is valuable for the
reasons I mentioned in the commit message).

(None of which is to say that people might not have disagreements that
need resolving, or that discussions about communication style aren't
welcome; just that I think the CoC is at a more meta level).
