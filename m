My apologies to the group -- I wasn't really cognizant of the fact
that its only been 3 days since my first email.  That has now been
made abundantly clear to me :)

I've been working on getting git working full-bore since the middle of
last week, of which this issue is just part of it, and I'm quickly
running out of time (Jan 5 I have to ditch this and go back to my
normal tasks).  All the days are blurring together.....

Anyhow, thanks for *your* patience with me, despite the lack of
manners on my end.  A happy & safe New Years to all!
