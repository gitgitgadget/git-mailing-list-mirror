Dear diary, on Thu, Sep 21, 2006 at 06:27:24PM CEST, I got a letter
where Shawn Pearce <spearce@spearce.org> said that...

Surprisingly few web mailing list interfaces are actually usable for
reading threads. Gmane is, MARC isn't (you don't see the list of
references and replies to the current mail, and the next/prev in thread
links somehow don't seem to be very reliable). That's a killer feature
for me, if MARC had that I'd have preferred it (I like black background
and dislike frames).
