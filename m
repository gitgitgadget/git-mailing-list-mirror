Yeah, there's a lot going on there that I don't think we care about
(though I am new to coccinelle, so maybe I would grow to appreciate the
features).

I was thinking of just moving the current Makefile snippet into a
script. That lets us avoid the irritating quoting. And we can use things
like functions, which would make the $?-handling in the loop less
tedious (because we can return straight out of the loop).

Hrm, you're right. I tried it earlier based on the commit message from
the original "coccicheck" commit, but I got "only garbage was found".
But now it works. I must have screwed it up (perhaps tab-completion
stopped at "copy.cocci" instead of "copy.cocci.patch").

That too. :)

I have no objections to pursuing that. But I think with my patch, it's
workable for now, so there's no rush.
