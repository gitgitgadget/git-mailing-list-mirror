We had a brilliant application to work on Git-Cheetah for non-Win32 
systems.  Unfortunately, another project snatched that student, but we 
were scarce on GSoC slots anyway.

This would have been very nice for me, as I almost exclusively work on 
Linux these days.  And I finally grasped the concept of "scratching your 
own itch".

So no, I have almost no intention on continuing to work on Git-Cheetah on 
Windows.  

Having said that, we had a contributor who seemed to be quite willing to 
continue working on Git-Cheetah, as can be seen from the commit history.  
However, I have the impression that my comments on his patches put him off 
somewhat, even if I really liked his work.

Ciao,
Dscho
