Yes, it's for performance reasons on a first split that I'd like to
see it. On the FreeBSD repo the difference is some 40 minutes vs. a
few seconds.

This sounds about perfect.

Fair enough, and we have lots of examples of slightly strange history
in svn that svn2git represents in interesting ways.

You should still be able to merge in updates from the external repo, but if you try to push changes upstream the deletion will break things.

I think this is fine - our main goal here is to be able to update
contrib/ code within FreeBSD as we do today with svn, and we may well
always have some changes that are never intended to be pushed
upstream.

Continuing the example from our repo, there is more history in the
"subtree" already, with 061ef1f9424f as the head. ca8624403626 is the
merge to mainline.
