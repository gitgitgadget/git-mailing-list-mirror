Correct. ;)

I like your general idea, but I agree with Daniel that it introduces an
inconsistency in the interface.

Right, I like that part. It's just that putting "HEAD" there already has
a meaning: it would find refs/heads/HEAD.

Now I'll grant that's a bad name for a branch (and the source of other
confusions, and I think perhaps even something a few commands actively
discourage these days).

I don't think this is about resolving HEAD, or showing it. It's about
the fact that arguments to "branch" are currently always branch-names,
not full refs.
