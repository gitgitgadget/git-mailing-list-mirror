I like the "bottom up" approach as well (and in fact, I gave a similarly
structured talk to some computer scientists a month or two ago). But I
have seen some comments from some users that imply to me they prefer a
"top down" approach.

So I'm curious: did you write this to show to some specific audience,
and if so, how did the audience receive it? IOW, did they like the
"bottom up" technique?
