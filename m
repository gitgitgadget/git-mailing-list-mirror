Yes, it's horrible - if for some reason it turns out that we cannot use 
"#include <stdbool.h>" everywhere I think we should drop it rather than 
providing a subtly incompatible fallback

I'm not sure we necessarily want to say "use anything that is in C99" 
for several reasons.

  - Some features such as C99's variable length arrays are known to be
    problematic.

  - As you say above there maybe features that we think harm the
    readability of our code.

  - As RenÃ© points out not all compilers necessarily support all
    features.

I think using _Bool could be useful for the reasons Peff outlined. As 
for other features I've written code that I think would have benefited 
from compound literals, but off the top of my head I can't think of any 
other C99 features that I personally wish we were using. I think that 
decl-after-statement is occasionally useful to declare a variable near 
where it is used in a long function body but it is much simpler just to 
ban it altogether and encourage people to break up long functions to 
make them more readable.

Best Wishes

Phillip
