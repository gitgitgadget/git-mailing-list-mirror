I think your "Behind the scenes, after the fact" is being unnecessarily
harsh.

What counts is what happens now after the launch, when there are issues
identified that he could address on his side if he wanted to work with the
community.  "Ignore and fork forever" may be to further fracture the
community, but for a book like his that has quite different aim than the
official manual set, it might be a sensible approach.  You have to weigh
the pros and cons.

We've seen other comments raised to both the book and the git-scm.com site
on this list after they were announced.  We'll see how they are addressed
in coming weeks.  I think it is not too late to voice your negative
judgements only after seeing what happens.
