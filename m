Not so insignificant fraction of these are done purely for the
purpose of using submitgit, though.  In other words, if submitgit
were improved not to require a pull request against [1] (instead, it
could be pointed at a branch in a contributor's repository and do
the fromatting), these numbers will go down.

I agree that I found the URL of the archive somewhat misleading for
those who want to contribute.  Giving the mailing list address makes
a lot more sense.  As suggested by Ã†var in the thread, it would also
be good to suggest submitgit, given that the target audience of this
message was already prepared to throw a pull request at us.

Two minor issues here.

1. push the "read" outside [], i.e.

	Please read [<human readable name of the thing>](<URL for
	the thing>) to learn...

   as what is inside [] and what is inside () ought to be the moral
   equivalents.

2. the thing is not called "the maintainer notes"; it is called "A
   note from the maintainer".

I'd prefer [the k.org address](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/plain/MaintNotes?h=todo).

Again, push "read our" outside [].

Thanks.
