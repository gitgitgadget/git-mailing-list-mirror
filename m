If you can be more specific I can go through and fix it...  There's some
extraneous bits on the page that I haven't figured out what they were
for originally but most everything on the page seems to work fine for me...

Like I said I'm not claiming it's completely 100% accurate in the
transition, but for a page that's 144K in size it looks like it's
predominantly correct.
