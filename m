Subject: [PATCH v2 2/2] docs/config: clarify "text property" in core.eol

The word "property" is vague here. Let's spell out that we mean the path
must be marked with the text attribute.

While we're here, let's make the paragraph a little easier to read by
de-emphasizing the "when core.autocrlf is false" bit. Putting it in the
first sentence obscures the main content, and many readers won't care
about autocrlf (i.e., anyone who is just following the gitattributes(7)
advice, which mainly discusses "text" and "core.eol").
