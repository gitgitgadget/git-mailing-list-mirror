Good catch. The issue is that we only add entries to the hashmap in
prepare_packed_git(), but they may be added to the pack list by other
callers of install_packed_git(). It probably makes sense to just push
the hashmap maintenance down into that function, like below. That
requires an extra strhash() when inserting a new pack, but I don't think
that's a big deal.
