I seem to recall some quirks where an inline function that is not called
directly is not required to be compiled at all, and the compiler can
assume that there is a definition available in another translation unit.

But I think that only applies when no storage-class specifier is
provided. In this case, you said "static", so I think it's OK?

It's possible I'm mis-remembering the issues, too. One problem is that
pre-C99, you might end up with the opposite problem (a compiled function
with visible linkage that conflicts with other translation units at link
time). E.g. here:

  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51533082/clarification-over-internal-linkage-of-inline-functions-in-c/51533367#51533367

But I think with "static" we should always be OK.

Don't get me wrong, I like type checking. It's just that doing weird
things with the language and pre-processor also carries a cost,
especially in an open source project where new folks may show up and say
"what the hell is this macro doing?". That's a friction for new
developers, even if they're comfortable with idiomatic C.

That said...

...I do find this evidence compelling.
