This looks good.

I don't know how difficult it was to arrive at the result above, but I 
wouldn't call inlining memcpy(3) an advanced optimization (anymore?), 
since the major compilers seem to be doing that.

The SWAP in prio-queue.c seems to be the one with the biggest 
performance impact.  Or perhaps it's the one in lookup_object()?  The 
former is easier to measure, though.

Here's what I get with CFLAGS="-builtin -O2" (best of five):

$ time ./t/helper/test-prio-queue $(seq 100000 -1 1) dump >/dev/null

real    0m0.142s
user    0m0.120s
sys     0m0.020s

And this is with CFLAGS="-no-builtin -O2":

$ time ./t/helper/test-prio-queue $(seq 100000 -1 1) dump >/dev/null

real    0m0.170s
user    0m0.156s
sys     0m0.012s

Hmm.  Not nice, but also not prohibitively slow.

I don't see a way to do that without adding a type parameter.
