Interesting. The existing rule is:

  struct object_id *OIDPTR1;
  struct object_id *OIDPTR2;
  @@
  - oidcmp(OIDPTR1, OIDPTR2) == 0
  + oideq(OIDPTR1, OIDPTR2)

The "== 0" part looks like it might be significant, but it's not.
Coccinelle knows that "!foo" is the same as "foo == 0" (and you can
confirm by tweaking it).

The addition of "identifer f != oideq" here isn't necessary (we don't
even define an "f" in the semantic patch part). And anyway, we use
hasheq() inside oideq(), so no need to override the rule there.

So the relevant part is probably that our existing rule specifies the
exact type, whereas your rule allows any expression.

And indeed, if I do this, it works:

diff --git a/contrib/coccinelle/object_id.cocci b/contrib/coccinelle/object_id.cocci
index ddf4f22bd7..62a6cee0eb 100644
--- a/contrib/coccinelle/object_id.cocci
+++ b/contrib/coccinelle/object_id.cocci
@@ -55,8 +55,8 @@ struct object_id OID;

+expression OIDPTR1;

 @@
 - oidcmp(OIDPTR1, OIDPTR2) == 0
 + oideq(OIDPTR1, OIDPTR2)

Which really _seems_ like a bug in coccinelle, unless I am missing
something. Because both of those parameters look like object_id pointers
(and the compiler would be complaining if it were not the case).  But I
also wonder if giving the specific types in the coccinelle rule is
buying us anything. If you passed two void pointers or ints or whatever
to !oidcmp(), we'd still want to rewrite it as oideq().
