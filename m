Just before the context your patch quotes, we have this in gitignore(5)
already:

    [...]It is not possible to re-include a file if a parent directory
    of that file is excluded. Git doesnâ€™t list excluded directories for
    performance reasons, so any patterns on contained files have no
    effect, no matter where they are defined.[...]

I can't see how your change to the documentation doesn't just re-state
what we already have documented, which is not to say the docs can't be
improved, but then we should clearly state this in one place, not
re-state it within the span of a few paragraphs.
