I do not remember that one.

But one thing I think everybody can be proud of about this
community is that we haven't had any meaningless flamewar at
all.  Even the discussions on the hotter side in the past,
perhaps primarily coming from crashing cultures, tended to
produce useful improvements.  

One example that comes to my mind is the UI change in 1.5.0.  It
started when Carl Worth was sufficiently irritated by how
different and inapproachable git was to new people, and at some
point the discussion almost went near "well, distributed is
different from CVS, so shut up and come back later when your CVS
braindamange is healed", but we quite didn't go that way.
Instead, the discussion resulted in the "usability and
teachability" theme.
