Google is not hosting GitTogether this year. There may be a Git
gathering in the EU sometime early next year, organized by GitHub.

Instead... Google is looking into hosting a 2 day Gerrit user
conference followed immediately by a Gerrit developer hackathon in
early November. Nothing concrete yet, but we are working on it, and
trying to make sure we have enough lead time for people to book an
affordable flight.

It is sad that people who know what is or what is not happening are
not taking care of letting people on this list know about it...

Best,
Christian.
