Yes, that's what we did. :) It's out now, so everybody should see the
fix.

It may open up some new options for us, though.

If we know on the server side that we are serving a remote request
(which is easy, and does not require client cooperation), can we assume
that the other side will show any sideband lines with its own
end-of-line clearing?

I'm not sure. Git does and always has (and even on a dumb terminal makes
a token effort at throwing some spaces in ;) ). But I'm not sure if
other clients do (and they of course might not even be displaying to a
terminal at all, if they're pulling sideband data into a GUI dialog or
similar).
