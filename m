Hi, Sorry I've not been able to attend to the list discussions recently.

I'd disagree with that line of reasoning in the sense that if someone is
on Windows wanting to 'view' a repo that was developed on Linux, with
colons in pathnames, and filenames like aux.c we shouldn't be
deliberately de-include them just because of those file/pathname
'accidents. I accept that the build system probably won't be working for
their Windows environment (how could it be?), but, if possible, we
should be able to support them, in some positive way. In our distributed
collaborative environment we can trip over the user'sÂ  'your file / your
build' tag.

That's a valid base method for all the NTFS valid file and path names.

The next level could be a mechanism for path and file name adjustment,
at least for a _copy-out_ step (without ability to 'git add' / check
back in).

Agree that the security aspects of `.Git` etc must still be retained.

True, but still worth recording as a useful Git project (and that there
are a number of nuances within it!)
