Hmm, actually, I suppose the true value of the warning is to help people
doing "git branch -l foo", and it would still work there. The "more
extreme" from your suggested patch would only affect "branch -l".

Still, I think I prefer the gentler version that we get by keeping it as
a warning even in the latter case.

Here's the patch. It goes on top of jk/branch-l-0-deprecation (and will
naturally conflict with the removal branch, but the resolution should be
obvious).

Subject: [PATCH] branch: issue "-l" deprecation warning after pager starts

If you run "git branch -l", we issue a deprecation warning
that "-l" is probably not doing what you expect. But we do
so while parsing the options, which is _before_ we start the
pager. Depending on your pager settings, this means that the
warning may get totally overwritten by the pager.

Instead, let's delay the message until after we would have
started the pager. If we do page, then it will end up inside
the pager (since we redirect stderr). And if not (including
the case when you really did mean for "-l" to work as
"--create-reflog"), then it will still get shown on stderr.
