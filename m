OK so what I've done so far is to clone the original then I added
another remote connected to new repo.  Then I did git merge newrepo.  It
did a bunch of stuff that flashed by really fast and then reported a
conflict.  Now if I do a git st there are a bunch of files that seem to
be already added to a commit and all the files with conflicts which it's
says need to be fixed and added.
I'm still learning git even after using it for several years.  I've
never really seen this before.  So the already added files are the ones
that git was able to merge mechanically?  If so can I diff those changes
some way?  Would I have to un add (reset HEAD) all those files to see
the diffs?  Would it have assumed that my changes are to be preferred?

Thanks again for all the great help!
