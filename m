Actually, v2.21.0 (and possibly others) segfault when they encounter a
commit-graph without CDAT chunk.

Here's what I did:
- Create a commit-graph, renaming "CDAT" to "CDA2" and otherwise
  identical.
- Call `git log`.
- Git segfaults after calling fill_commit_graph_info().

Diff for the hexdump of commit-graph files:

(They also differ in the hash checksum, but I don't suppose that would
explain the segfault.)

With this, I presume "CDAT Chunk Replaced With Another Chunk" is no
longer feasible?

The commit-graph files:
"CDA2" - https://github.com/abhishekkumar2718/GSoC20/blob/master/commit-graph-cda2
"CDAT" - https://github.com/abhishekkumar2718/GSoC20/blob/master/commit-graph-cdat

That's actually a great point. This might save us some calculation as we
don't need to calculate the "correction offsets".

Yes, that's definitely possible. Dr. Stolee raised the same point too,
and I am working on using trace2 API to find the largest offset and the
number of commits for the tests.

Another disadvantage is that the CDA2 chunk yet again limits the size of
generation number. Future generation numbers will be restricted to 64
bits by the design of CDA2.

It's based on the linux repository.
