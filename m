The idea is that there are per-worktree lock stored under worktree-locks 
(hence the plural name). Using a separate directory for the locks gets 
round the problems of name clashes between the lock for a worktree 
called foo and one called foo.lock and means we can rely on mkdir 
erroring out if the worktree name already exists as there is no renaming.
