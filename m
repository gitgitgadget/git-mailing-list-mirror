Yes, but you need ssize_t to handle the negative return values.

Perhaps, but...

You'd think that when I ran "man SSL_write" while writing the other
email I would have noticed that SSL_write_ex() is mentioned right there
in the synopsis. But somehow I didn't.

I don't think we document a required version for ssl. That version is
"only" 5.5 years old, but I think it would be OK here (especially given
that imap-send is an optional component with a build-time knob).

In which case I think fixing socket_write() would fix this problem, and
then building your other patch on top, it doesn't need to worry about
INT_MAX at all.

Looking at the conversion, I think there's a slight gotcha with
retaining the "0" return value from SSL_write_ex() to pass to
socket_perror() in the error path. Which makes me wonder about that
error path at all; it closes descriptors but doesn't handle SSL at all.
Should it be using socket_shutdown()? And should that function set
sock->ssl to NULL and the descriptors to -1? The rabbit hole of
imap-send is infinite.

OK, I laughed out loud at this. Perhaps a sign of too much Git.
