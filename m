In the release notes "git status" was not mentioned, also shortly explain
the "-dirty" output generated by diff.

Added a paragraph to the "Pitfalls with submodules" section in
user-manual.txt describing new and old behavior of "git status" and "git
diff" for dirty submodules.

 -------------------------------------------------

+In older git versions it could be easily forgotten to commit new or modified
+files in a submodule, which silently leads to similar problems as not pushing
+the submodule changes. Starting with git 1.7.0 both "git status" and "git diff"
+in the superproject show submodules as modified when they contain new or
+modified files to protect against accidentally committing such a state. "git
+diff" will also add a "-dirty" to the work tree side when generating patch
+output or used with the --submodule option:

 You also should not rewind branches in a submodule beyond commits that were
 ever recorded in any superproject.
