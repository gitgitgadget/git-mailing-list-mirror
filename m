I agree.  git-apply in general is presented a patch output, not
necessary git-diff output (it could be output generated by GNU diff,
or by 'scm diff' from some SCM...).

Either "git-rev-list" or "'git rev-list'" is fine; "git rev-list"
is not, as it requires careful reading to notice which part is
proposed git command, and which the rest of message.

I think that "git foo: message" is unambiguous, and I guess _that_
could be even in one single large patch.  Other cases I guess need
careful review and thinking about in a case by case basis,
unfortunately.

Better to be careful about that change than to make change and then
notice that it is not good...
