The intent of those docs was and still is to say "5.8 and the modules it
ships with".

This was discussed when 2.17.0 was released with my changes to make us
unconditionally use Digest::MD5:
https://public-inbox.org/git/87fu50e0ht.fsf@evledraar.gmail.com/

As noted there that's not some dogmatic "RedHat altered perl so we don't
care about them", but rather that in practice this doesn't impact users
negatively, so I think it's fine.

Right, this doesn't apply to autodie. Looking at
https://www.cpan.org/ports/binaries.html there were a lot of releases
that had 5.10.0, not *.1.

Also git-credential-netrc is in contrib, I don't know if that warrants
treating it differently, I don't use it myself, and don't know how much
it's "not really contrib" in practice (e.g. like the bash completion
which is installed everywhere...)>

But yeah, skimming the code it would be easy to remove the dependency.
