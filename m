- I'm working for NSA, and my name is classified.
- If people knew who I am, they would fault me for my starting a war, 
  instead of commenting on my patches.
- I could use a pseudonym, but that would be a lie, and since you cannot 
  tell if it is a pseudonym to begin with, it is an even bigger lie, and 
  if I did not use a pseudonym, you could mistake it for one, and I could
  not live with that lie at all. (Recurse ad infinitum.)

Having said all that, I think it is important to provide a real and 
traceable name with patches (at least patches which do not do obvious 
things, like fix typos). If only for the reason that incompetent and 
malign people like to sue not only each other.

Ciao,
Dscho
