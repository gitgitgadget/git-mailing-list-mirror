Well, proper mentoring *is* time-consuming. It is not like you're just
waiting for code to review, then do exactly the same as on the Git mailing
list. That'd not be mentoring. That'd be called "reviewing".

I still struggle, personally, to improve my mentoring skills, and at the
same time, I find it rewarding and I learn a lot. So I guess you can count
me in when it comes to Outreachy.

Ciao,
