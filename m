I think that patch does the write_or_die conversion to handle EPIPE, but
it would still need to turn off SIGPIPE for the whole process.

So you'd also need to stick a:

  sigchain_push(SIGPIPE, SIG_IGN);

somewhere near the start of cmd_fetch(). (There may be a less
coarse-grained place to put it, but at this point I think we're just
trying to find out whether this approach even solves the problem).
