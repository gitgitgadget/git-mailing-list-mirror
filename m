Brilliant! ðŸ˜Š

The complexity is that the branches in all submodules all have to have compatible >>semantics when doing the checkout, which is by no means guaranteed. In the scenario where you are including a submodule from a third-party (very >>common - see gnulib), the branches likely won't be there, so you have a high probability of having the command fail or produce the same results as >>currently exists if you allow the checkout even with problems (another option?). If you have control of everything, then this makes sense.

>I am trying to give the use case of having control over everything (or rather mixed) more thought as well, e.g. "checkout --recurse-submodules -b ><name>" may want to create the branches in a subset of submodules as well.

I have to admit that I just assumed it would have to work that way this would not be particularly useful. However, in thinking about it, we might want to limit the depth of how far -b <name> takes effect. If the super module brings in submodules entirely within control of the development group, having -b <name> apply down to leaf submodules makes sense (in some policies). However, if some submodules span out to, say, gnulib, that might not make particular sense. Some downward limit might be appropriate. Perhaps, in the submodule ref, you might want to qualify it as <commit>:<ref> (but the impact of that is probably and admittedly pretty horrid). I hesitate to suggest a numeric limit, as that assumes that submodules are organized in a balanced tree - which is axiomatically unreasonable. Maybe something in .git/config, like

[branch "topic*"]
	submodules=a,b,c

But I suspect that would make things even more confusing.

Cheers,
Randall
