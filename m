It's really quite random. It needs to be a two- or three-letter thing just 
because I end up typing a lot. 

My favourite explanation is "I name all my projects after myself: first 
'Linux', now 'git'".

Which only makes sense if you know british slang.

The runner up was "Because 'twerp' was too hard to type".

But really, there's not a lot of real thinking behind it. The made-up 
acronym was "global information tracker", but that's a pretty bad excuse 
too.

It just happened. Don't ask me why. All the explanations are really made 
up after the fact.
