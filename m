Zakynthos Island: =20
----------------
Zakynthos is a tourist destination, with an international airport serve=
d by many charter flights from northern Europe.=20
The island's nickname is To fioro tou Levante (Italian: Il fiore di Lev=
ante, English: The flower of the East), given by the Venetians

-----------------------------------------------------------------------=

Zakynthos was inhabited from the Neolithic Age, as some archaeological =
excavations have proved. The ancient Greek poet Homer mentioned the isl=
and in the Iliad and the Odyssey, stating that the first inhabitants of=
 it were the son of King=20
Dardanos of Troy called Zakynthos and his men. In mythology the island =
was then conquered by King Arkesios of Kefalonia, and then by Odysseus =
from Ithaca. Later on, a treaty was signed that made Zakynthos an indep=
endent democracy, the first established in Greece, that lasted more tha=
n 650 years. The Athenian military commander Tolmides concluded an alli=
ance with Zakynthus during the First Peloponnesian War sometime between=
 459 and 446 BC.
The importance of this alliance for Athens was that it provided them wi=
th a source of tar. Tar is a more effective protector of ship planking =
than pitch (which is made from pine trees). The Athenian trireme fleet =
needed protection from rot, decay and the teredo, so this new source of=
 tar was valuable to them. The tar was dredged up from the bottom of a =
lake (now known as Lake Keri) using leafy myrtle branches tied to the e=
nds of poles.=20
It was then collected in pots and could be carried to the beach and swa=
bbed directly onto ship hulls. Alternatively, the tar could be shipped =
to the Athenian naval yard at the Piraeus for storage. During the Middl=
e Ages, the island was part of the Byzantine theme of Cephallenia. Afte=
r 1185 it became part of the County palatine of Cephalonia and Zakyntho=
s under the Kingdom of Naples until its last Count Leonardo III Tocco w=
as defeated by the Ottomans in 1479. The Turkish rule lasted only until=
 22 April 1484, when it was swapped with the Turks by Venetian secretar=
y Giovanni Dario, negotiator of the treaty of Constantinople (1479), ag=
ainst neighboring Cephalonia and an annual tribute of 500 ducats. From =
then on Zakynthos remained an overseas colony of the Venetian Republic =
until its very end in 1797, following the fate of the Ionian islands, c=
ompleted by the capture of Cephalonia in 1500
and Lefkas in 1684 from the Turks. Venetian rule protected the island f=
rom Ottoman domination but in its place it put a feudal oligarchy. The =
cultural influence of Venice (and of Venetian on local dialect) was con=
siderable. The wealthy made a habit of sending their sons to Italy to b=
e educated.  Good examples are Dionysios Solomos, a native of Zakynthos=
 and Greece's national poet, and Ugo Foscolo, also native of Zakynthos =
and a national Italian poet. However, both the Greek language and Ortho=
dox faith survived intact. From the 16th to the 18th centuries, it was =
one of the largest exporters of currants in the world together with Cep=
halonia. French, Ionian state period and British Rule: The Treaty of Ca=
mpoformio dismantling the Venetian Republic awarded the Ionian Islands =
to France. General Antoine Gentili, leading a French expeditionary forc=
e with boats captured in Venice, took control
of the islands on 26 June 1797. From 1797 to 1798, the island was part =
of the French d=E9partment Mer-=C9g=E9e. A Russian-Turkish fleet captur=
ed the island on 23 October 1798. From 1800 to 1807, it was part of the=
 Septinsular Republic, nominally under sovereignty of the Ottoman Empir=
e but protected by Russia. In 1800=961801, Britain attempted to take co=
ntrol of the Ionian islands from Zakynthos after a revolt, under the le=
adership of James Callander Campbell[7] but these intentions stopped af=
ter the Peace of Amiens.[8][9][10] After a second period under French c=
ontrol (1807=961809) following the treaty of Tilsit, it was conquered b=
y Great Britain on 16 October 1809, and was part of the British protect=
orate of the United States of the Ionian Islands from 1815 to 1864. In =
1864, Zakynthos, together with all the other Ionian Islands, became a f=
ull member of the Greek state, ceded by Britain to
stabilize the rule of the newly crowned Danish-born King of the Hellene=
s, George I. During the Nazi occupation of Greece, Mayor Karrer and Bis=
hop Chrysostomos refused Nazi orders to turn in a list of the members o=
f the town's Jewish community for deportation to the death camps. Inste=
ad they hid the town's 275 Jews in rural villages. Every Jew of Zakynth=
os survived the war. Statues of the Bishop and the Mayor commemorate th=
eir heroism on the site of the town's historic synagogue, destroyed in =
the earthquake of 1953. In 1978, Yad Vashem, the Holocaust Martyrs' and=
 Heroes' Remembrance Authority in Israel, honored Bishop Chrysostomos a=
nd Mayor Loukas Karrer with the title of "Righteous among the Nations",=
 an honor given to non-Jews who, at personal risk, saved Jews during th=
e Holocaust. After the war, all of the Jews of Zakynthos moved either t=
o Israel or to Athens.=20
