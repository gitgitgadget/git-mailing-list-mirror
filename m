Sorry, it is indeed asking for a CAPTCHA. Google reCAPTCHA does not do
a great job at accomodating Tor users; it effectively blocks us with an
endless barrage of puzzles unless we log in to a Google account.

That's fine to use it as a CDN/cache; setting the site protection to
"essentially off" should indeed help. For whatever reason, Cloudflare
still isn't smart enough to allow greylisted IP addresses during times
of low/no abuse -- either that or a lot of people use CF with the
misconception that it's for anti-spam on blogs and forums, so it's
easier to just block Tor. CF representatives have been involved in
public discussions elsewhere, claiming they are working to improve the
experience for Tor Browser users, but these discussions have been going
on for years now, so I wouldn't hold my breath. That's why I have to
make webmasters aware of this, because not everyone realises how
inaccessible the web becomes for people who use Tor. Personally I use
it although I'm in a relatively free country, but there are others who
use it to escape censorship. And when services like Cloudflare
inadvertently act as censors, it defeats the purpose of Tor for this
group of people.

Yeah, if caching *is* handled directly on git-scm's side, I would
recommend something more suited for caching such as Varnish or
memcached (depending on the type of caching you're doing). Personally I
use memcached on a Tor hidden service I host and it seems to cut down
on server pressure from bot requests. This is why I even suggest to
webmasters to reconsider their use of CF; I'm not naÃ¯ve and I do have
some experience with handling webserver abuse. But again, I won't argue
if the site genuinely benefits from using CF as a CDN.

It is indeed a lot of effort to change a site's inner workings. I'm
glad that this possibility is at least considered and I hope it's an
accomplishable goal in the future. It'd be nice to see the web revert
to its more static, sustainable days.
