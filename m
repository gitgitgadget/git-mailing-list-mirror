Yeah, I don't think it makes sense to reuse those. I kind of doubt that
it is worth making it configurable, as credential-store does not
otherwise read any config at all.

The defaults for those other two values are 100ms and 1s respectively.
So probably just setting a 1s timeout would be plenty, and saves us from
looping forever if we see a stale lockfile.
