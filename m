Maybe both. :) This is an interesting case.

The arguments to git-show (like anything that invokes the revision
machinery, like git-log) can be _either_ an object identifier or a
pathspec. Since you didn't provide a "--" separator to disambiguate,
we'll try both.

For your case "HEAD:a\b", as well as the more mundane "HEAD:a-b",
get_oid() realizes they are not valid object identifiers (because the
files don't exist in HEAD^{tree}). So then we consider it as a pathspec.

In the case of "HEAD:a-b", no such file exists in the working tree
either, so we complain:

 $ git show HEAD:a-b
 fatal: Path 'a-b' does not exist in 'HEAD'

and here verify_filename(), which produces the error, is smart enough to
diagnose that the bogus argument looks a lot like a request for a
path-in-tree.

But since 28fcc0b71a (pathspec: avoid the need of "--" when wildcard is
used, 2015-05-02), we allow non-files as pathspecs if they use magic
glob meta-characters (to make it more convenient to use "*.c" or
similar). And "\" is such a meta-character. So we actually diff HEAD
using the pathspec "HEAD:a\b", which of course matches nothing.

You can defeat this by using "--". I.e.:

  [mundane name, dwim logic complains because file doesn't exist]
  $ git show HEAD:a-b
  fatal: Path 'a-b' does not exist in 'HEAD'

  [mundane name, explicit pathspec does diff with no matches]
  $ git show -- HEAD:a-b

  [mundane name, explicit revision complains that it can't be resolved]
  $ git show HEAD:a-b --
  fatal: bad revision 'HEAD:a-b'

  [exotic name, dwim considers it a pathspec due to metacharacter]
  $ git show HEAD:a\\b

  [exotic name, explicit pathspec does the same thing]
  $ git show -- HEAD:a\\b

  [exotic name, explicit revision is just like the mundane case]
  $ git show HEAD:a\\b --
  fatal: bad revision 'HEAD:a\b'

So everything is working as designed, or at least explainable. But I
think there is some room for improvement. A backslash that isn't
followed by a glob meta-character _is_ still a meta character (your
"a\b" would be globbing for "ab"). But it's useless enough that I think
it shouldn't be enough to trigger the "oh, you probably meant this as a
pathspec" DWIM rule.

We _could_ also say "even though this could technically be a pathspec
because of its metacharacter, it looks vaguely enough like a
path-in-tree revision that we shouldn't guess". That I'm less
comfortable with, just because it makes the heuristics even more
magical.

Also, unrelated to your problem, but I find it interesting in the output
above that "git show HEAD:foo --" produces a less useful error message
than "git show HEAD:foo" without the separator, even though the user has
given us even more information about their intent. I think the DWIM
verify_filename() has grown a lot more diagnosis code over the years
that could also be used in the other code path.
