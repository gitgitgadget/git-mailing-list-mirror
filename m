I also looked at Github:FI recently because my employer basically said
that OSS is fine at our company, so long as we can find corporate
support for it so that we always have someone else to point at if
something goes wrong.

Quick googling load me to some not-so-promising sites that looked sort
of cookie cutter and Github:FI, which looked awesome, but as many
people noted in the previous thread, was surprisingly expensive,
especially considering that Fog Creek offers hosted and installed
support for hg at a substantially lower price.

Anyone know of any big git supporters in the world?
