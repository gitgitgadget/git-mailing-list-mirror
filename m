You do not have to insist on using git to hack on git itself.  I
was more annoyed by the fact that the patch was an attachment,
than it was generated by diff without leading a/ and b/ paths.

Being able to accept a patch that was made against freshly
extracted tarball distribution is a good thing.  I can take
diffs generated by GNU diff against released tarballs just
fine.

If you make it a requirement to send even an trivially obvious
patch from controlled source, it would make the barrier to
contribute much higher.  Once you make it hard enough to submit
patches, you will end up seeing only whining without patches on
this list.  I do not think we want to go in that direction.
