This function is modeled after the other is_excluded_from* functions in 
dir.c so that the return value can be handled the same way.  I don't 
anticipate any need for change but you're right, we could return some 
other "negative other than -1" if it was ever needed.

Great suggestion!  I was looking for a better way to ensure the buffer 
ownership transfer was robust.  I'll do both strbuf_detach() and update 
the header file.  Thank you.
