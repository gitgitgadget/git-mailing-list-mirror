Thanks for letting us know. I am somewhat in the same boat. I might be
able to make time, but the bar that the student/project combo would have
to clear would be quite high for me to agree to do so.

This brings up an important issue. We cannot do GSoC without mentors. I
had hoped that people populating the "ideas" list would volunteer to
mentor for their projects.

But so far the possibilities are:

  - Stefan

  - me, who has already promised to be stingy

  - Matthieu, who also cited time constraints

  - Junio, who contributed some project ideas, but who in the past has
    declined to mentor in order to remain impartial as the maintainer
    who evaluates student results (which I think is quite reasonable)

So...basically 1 mentor and 2 reticent maybes? That doesn't look good.
We are not committed to anything until we accept student proposals,
of course. But I would not want to waste students' time in applying if
it is not realistic for us to accept them.
