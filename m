It is true that stash doesn't touch HEAD.  So logically the stash 
operations should not end up in the HEAD reflog.  But maybe creating a 
reflog only for stashed states could be a good thing.

I personally don't use stash that much since I've grown the habit of 
saving temporary states to a temporary branch before git-stash even 
existed, which in that case is always captured by the HEAD reflog.
