If I may notice, avoiding top posting has already been suggested twice, 
IIRC.

I think that various webmails have made top posting popular, and 
actually forced people a bit to do that through the way their user 
interfaces were laid out, which made inline replies kind of a dying art, 
which is really sad to see.  It is so much more useful when replies are 
posted inline, i.e. right below the contents they refer to.
