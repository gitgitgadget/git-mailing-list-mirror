Hello git-community,

most of you will already have noticed it (through the builtin 
update-functionality) but I'd thought I make a quick announcement here 
as well: GitX 0.7, a git-GUI for Mac OS X, was released yesterday.

To see what's changed have a look at the Release History [1]. I also 
wrote up a blog-post [2] describing the most obvious changes with 
screenshots. If you're a GitX-user, consider taking our short survey [3] 
which we set up for the release of 0.7.

If you're thinking about contributing to GitX have a look at our fairly 
new mailinglist [4], which is supposed to become the main means of 
coordination for us. We have a few big features that have been requested 
by users time and again, so it would be a perfect chance to make a big 
impression on a relatively young and small open-source project.

Thanks to the git-community for providing us with broad and steady 
shoulders to stand on ;)

Greetings,
Jojo
