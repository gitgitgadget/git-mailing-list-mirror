"decided"!  Now that's a strong word for my wild brainstorming if I
ever heard one, in particular considering my well-near non-existent
record of contributions and popularity here: most of the recent
"discussion" has been me following up on myself.

Anyway, thanks for the heads-up: very much appreciated.  I'll probably
badly need it when people in Pacific Standard Time get to work again
and tear me to pieces.
