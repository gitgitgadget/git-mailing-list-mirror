Arrgh!  That was an e-mail I was drafting when I suffered a power
failure.  That's why it's full of incomplete sentences and repeitions;
I was trying different wordings.

It was never supposed to be sent, and when the power came back on
I decided not to try to resurrect it.  But apparently when the
ssh connetion hung up, the draft got sent. :-(

My apoogies, mea culpa, and please ignore.
