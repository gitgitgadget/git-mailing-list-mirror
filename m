This is a known problem.  Unfortunately, noone has implemented a fix, 
although if you're serious about it, I can point you to threads where it 
has been hinted how to solve the issue.

FWIW the issue is that Mac OS X decides that it knows better how to encode 
your filename than you could yourself.

Ciao,
