I'm not going to bother responding to your email point by point, as I
have very little else to say.

I am telling you that as a reviewer of git patches, I found the more
verbose message by Jonathan to be much easier to review than your
one-line description. You may disagree. I offer my experience merely as
a data point, and I will let others draw their own conclusions. If you
want to ignore me, that's your right, but I don't see any point in
arguing further about it.
