Thanks for the input... that method has sort of worked so far but
somewhat tedious

All I can say about that is that it was NOT my doing.
I only included bazaar cvs mercurial, git and subversion.

Its a mystery to me too.  I hadn't noticed until you mentioned it.
I removed it from this reply.

A copy of my OP is kept on my home machine.  It shows exactly what I
sent out, I'm not sure what it goes thru when it gets to gmane server:
