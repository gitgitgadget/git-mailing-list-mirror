I'd noticed it, too, while doing recent leak fixes. But since Patrick
has been working on leaks and is the go-to person for reftables, I
assumed he had already seen it and there was something clever going on. ;)

I also get a passing result from t0612 (and I do have JGit available, so
it actually runs the tests).

I also get funny results from t4255, but I think we can ignore them.
It's known breakages vanishing, which I guess is just some sub-program
returning failure due to a leak and changing the test results.

So anyway, this patch looks good to me, but probably we could squash
t0612 into it, as well.
