Hmm, I would go in the opposite direction and take a leaf out of
Ã†var's book (see commit bc548efe) and this one-liner:

diff --git a/Makefile b/Makefile
index ee89c06..c08c25e 100644
--- a/Makefile
+++ b/Makefile
@@ -2506,7 +2506,7 @@ profile-clean:
 
 clean: profile-clean coverage-clean
        $(RM) *.res
-       $(RM) $(OBJECTS)
+       $(RM) $(addsuffix *.o,$(object_dirs))
        $(RM) $(LIB_FILE) $(XDIFF_LIB) $(VCSSVN_LIB)
        $(RM) $(ALL_PROGRAMS) $(SCRIPT_LIB) $(BUILT_INS) git$X
        $(RM) $(TEST_PROGRAMS) $(NO_INSTALL)

This would actually solve my problem, but it actually isn't a
_complete_ solution. (Hint: think about what isn't in $(OBJECTS),
depending on the configuration). ;-)

Hmm, I suspect that wouldn't happen, which would reduce it usefulness
and ultimately lead to it not being used. (Updating the 'stop list' would
fast become a burden.)

I find it useful to flag these issues automatically, but I still need
to look at each symbol and decide what to do (you may not agree with
some of my choices either - take a look at the output on the master
branch!).

The way I use it, I effectively ignore the 'stop list' maintenance issues.

ATB,
