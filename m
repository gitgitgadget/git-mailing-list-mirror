I missed this one... lrand48 is also not generally available. I donâ€™t think it is even available on Windows.

If we need a generalized solution, it probably needs to be abstracted in git-compat-util.h and compat/rand.[ch], so that the platform maintainers can plug in whatever decent platform randomization happens to be available, if any. We know that rand() is vulnerable, but it might be the only generally available fallback. Perhaps get the compat layer in place with a test suite that exercises the implementation before getting into the general git code base - maybe based on jitterentropy or sslrng. Agree on an interface, decide on a period of time to implement, send the word out that this needs to get done, and hope for the best. I have code that passes FIPS-140 for NonStop ia64 (-ish although not jitterentropy) and x86, and I'm happy to contribute some of this.
