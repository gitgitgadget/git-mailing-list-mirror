Makes sense, and it's the way http-push already works for heads.  I
guess where I'm not clear is tags - since info/refs is generated by
recursing through everything in the refs/ subdirectory.  I think I just
answered my own question though; http-push needs to recurse through
everything under refs/ on the remote end to generate the new info/refs
file.  That just leaves the problem that http-push doesn't push tags
yet.
