Your commit message mostly tells us the "what" that we can see from the
diff. But why are we segfaulting? What assumption is being violated, and
why is the fix the right thing?

You've stuck some of the details in your notes, and they should probably
make it into the commit message.

The other obvious time when HEAD is not valid is when you are on an
unborn branch. So we should also consider how such a case interacts with
the callsites you are touching.

I think it is primarily this hunk:

that is the fix. We assume that add_head_to_pending() put something into
rev_info.pending, but it might not.

In the case of corruption, "bad object HEAD" is a reasonable outcome.

In the case of an unborn branch, we'd probably want to compare against
the empty tree. This trick is used elsewhere in wt-status.c, as in
wt_status_collect_changes_index().

I'm not sure if we need to deal with that here or not. I wasn't able to
trigger this code with an unborn branch. If you have no index, then the
is_cache_unborn() check triggers earlier in the function. If you do have
an index, then we have an earlier check:

  if (is_null_sha1(orig_head) && !is_cache_unborn())
	die(_("Updating an unborn branch with changes added to the index."));

that covers this case. I am not 100% sure that check is correct, though.
If I do:

  git init
  echo content >foo
  git add foo
  git rm -f foo

then I have an index which is not "unborn", but also does not contain
any changes. I think the conditional above should just be checking
"active_nr". If we were to fix that, then I think
has_uncommitted_changes() would need to be adjusted as well.

I admit that this is probably an absurd corner case.  So I think I am OK
with your fix for now, and we can revisit the logic later if anybody
starts to care.

Yikes. That should never lead to a corrupted HEAD (unless you are on a
networked filesystem). I can't think of another read add_head_to_pending
would fail, though, aside from a missing or corrupted object.

Arguably add_head_to_pending() should die loudly if it can't parse the
object pointed to by HEAD, rather than quietly returning without adding
anything.

So if I understand correctly, this hunk should not trigger anymore,
because we would never call run_diff_index() without something in
pending.

I think it would be a programming error elsewhere to do so, and we
should treat this as an assertion by complaining loudly (for this and
any other confusing cases):

  if (revs->pending.nr != 1)
          die("BUG: run_diff_index requires exactly one rev (got %d)",
	      revs->pending.nr);

Lastly, I think this is your first patch. So welcome, and thank you. :)
I know there was a lot of discussion and critique above, but I think
overall your patch is going in the right direction.
