Why not do both?

I think you are right, that it is currently not very visible in the Dis=
cussion=20
section. But on the other hand if you have a step by step guide it shou=
ld=20
probably mention that as well. It has nothing to do with laziness. But =
most=20
people follow a step by step guide because they expect that it illustra=
tes the=20
correct procedure. Jonathan's addition is short but effective.
