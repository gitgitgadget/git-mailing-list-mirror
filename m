Looks good to me.

I think this information about precedence between one-shot `clean`
and `smudge` filter driver configuration, and multi-file `process`
filter driver should be here for two reasons.

First, if one is interested in running filter, but do not want to
write one (he or she uses existing tool, for example one of
existing LFS solutions), one can skip the "Long Running Filter
Process" section.  But one still needs to know if to remove or
comment out old `clean` and `smudge` config, or how to provide
fallback for older Git (if one uses the same configuration with
pre-process Git and Git including support for this feature).

Second, the configuration belongs, in my opinion, here.  It is
not a part of long running filter protocol.

Yes.

Well, I think it is better to err out on the side of being more

I'm sorry it was *my mistake*.  I have read the example exchange wrong.

On the other hand that means that I have other comment, which I though
was addressed already in v10, namely that not all exchanges ends with
flush packet (inconsistency, and I think a bit of lack of extendability).

[thinking out loud]

And this serves as a 'canary' to detect single-shot driver mis-configured
to serve as multi-file filter driver.

Actually, the text reads that filter driver sends two lines: a line with
magic signature "git-filter-server", and exactly one line with protocol
version "version=2", *WITHOUT* terminating flush packet.

The example reads the same, I have just missed change of prefix from
"git<" to "git>" (that is "<" to mark response from filter, to ">" to
mark signal from Git).

So the text and example agrees, just me (and now you) misread the
example ;-/


IMHO this exchange should be also terminated with a flush packet,
even if in protocol version 2 it is fixed length list, and doesn't
strictly need it.

First, it would make easier to implement the filter driver process.
You would need only one 'read until flush' helper function, and two
higher-level functions: one for handling metadata, one for handling
contents (where handling = sending or receiving).  Currently first
data send from filter is a bit of special case: you need to send
two pkt-lines, not send this list of lines and terminate with flush.

Second, it would allow for additional possibilities for new versions
and extending protocol, either 3-part handshake (but now I think that
4-part is better, at least in some cases), or some other "early start"
extension.  OTOH we could stuff this data in additional exchange
(assuming new protocol version), and unless the exchange data goes
through slow channel (e.g. network), it shouldn't matter for the
latency that we have one more exchange.

Third, as we can see first from my error, then from yours, it would
make it easier to debug the protocol...

Yes, it does; as I have said already, I have misread the example. 

Anyway, in some cases 4-way handshake, where Git sends list of
supported capabilities first, is better.  If the protocol has
to prepare something for each of capabilities, and perhaps check
those preparation status, it can do it after Git sends what it
could need, and before it sends what it does support.

Though it looks a bit strange that client (as Git is client here)
sends its capabilities first...

Right.

From what I remember it was Peff stating that he thinks "<foo>=true"
is easier for parsing (it is, but we still need to support the harder
way parsing anyway), and offered that "<foo>" is good enough (if less
consistent).

> I am happy to change that if a second reviewer shares your

Also, with "capability=<foo>" we can be more self descriptive,
for example "supported-command=<foo>"; though "capability" is good
enough for me.

For example

 packet:          git> wants=clean
 packet:          git> wants=smudge
 packet:          git> wants=size
 packet:          git> 0000
 packet:          git< supports=clean
 packet:          git< supports=smudge
 packet:          git< 0000

Though coming up with good names is hard; and as I said "capability"
is good enough; OTOH with "smudge=true" etc. we don't need to come
up with good name at all... though I wonder if it is a good thing `\_o,_/

Thanks.  That doesn't matter much, but it matters.

Though it could go either way.

I'm a bit unsure.  Original reads better and is shorter; the new
proposal is more explicit, but also more repetitive and longer.

O.K. though shouldn't it be after "empty list", then?

All right, I think.

All right, though you could also write it as "mimic what the ...

I think it might be good idea to have here the information about
what filter process should do if it needs maybe lengthy closing
