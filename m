I think we should mark it as "optional", although optional might not
have been the best choice word. 

Optional (for me) implies that it is configurable and decided by the end-user
directly.  However, it is *conditional* - on the existing commit graph file(s)
(if any) and the version of Git.

We store the dates directly rather 8-byte offsets. Will clarify.

It's always better to be explicit. Thanks for the detailed review.

That's a force of habit - I like to write markdown with greater
indentation. Should have been indented with one space instead of two.

Rewriting split commit-graph as a single file is a case where there are
no "existing layers below the new layer". We should clarify that if the
new layer is the only layer, it will always have corrected commit dates
when written by compatible versions of Git. 

I have appended a paragraph at the end:

  While writing or merging layers, if the new layer is the only layer,
  it will have corrected commit dates when written by compatible
  versions of Git. Thus, rewriting split commit-graph as a singel file
  (`--split=replace`) creates a single layer with corrected commit
  dates.
