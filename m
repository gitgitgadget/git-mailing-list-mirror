Yeah, I did those two scripts to try to prove to myself that the
approach was good. But I haven't really pushed it any further.

Martin Ã…gren (cc'd) did some follow-up work, but I think we still have a
long way to go. My hope is that people who are interested in
leak-checking their new code can run some specific script they're
interested in, and maybe fix up one or two nearby bits while they're
there (either by fixing a leak, or just annotating via UNLEAK). Then we
can slowly converge on correctness. :)
