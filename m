This is not a critique of the delta islands feature, just something I'm
curious about.

Why is Drupal blocked on something like delta-islands? The blog post
mentions they have 45k projects, which can be browsed at
https://cgit.drupalcode.org

Almost all of those are completely independent projects, so they
wouldn't benefit from delta islands, and I'd guess >98% are of them are
in an obscure long tail and probably won't have even a single fork.

That leaves forks of say drupal.git, which is ~150MB, the mirror on
GitHub has 1500 forks: https://github.com/drupal Even if there were 5000
forks of that that would be 750G of disk space.

So accounting for backups, me being off by a lot etc. let's say that's
5TB. That's relatively cheap today. Are they really just holding up
their GitLab migration plans to save something on the order of that disk
space, or have I missed something here?

Again, not a critique of delta-islands, because it's most certainly
useful for the likes of github/gitlab, but I wonder if for this
particular problem it wouldn't be more straightforward of a solution for
GitLab to allow anyone to push to
refs/for-merge/<their-username>/<some-name-they-pick> on any
repository. Then they could open a MR for an existing branch in the repo
(which GitLab already supports).
