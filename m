Google has announced the selected organizations for GSoC 2009:

  http://socghop.appspot.com/program/accepted_orgs/google/gsoc2009

Students interested in applying should look at Git's ideas list,
or any other accepted org's ideas list:

  http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/SoC2009Ideas


Mentors for Git are really needed.  I'm going to be too busy this
summer to mentor a student myself.  If we have no mentors, we'll
have to pull out late, upsetting everyone, including my boss,
and worse, LH.
