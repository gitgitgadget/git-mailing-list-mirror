Good point, ensuring such consistency would be really good.

Agreed, consistency is good.

After thinking a bit more about the whole thing, I think that using
"<branch>" instead of "<name>" or "<branchname>" would be our best
choice.  It would be simple, direct and clear.

Regarding the branch copy and rename operations and their argument
names, perhaps the following would be a good choice:

     --copy [<branch>] <destination>
     --move [<branch>] <destination>

It would clearly reflect the nature of the performed operations, while
still using "<branch>" consistently, this time to refer to the source
branch.  Using "<destination>" to select the destination name should
be pretty much self-descriptive, if you agree.

Of course, I'll get back to this later in this message.

Perhaps.  That should be another example of the long-term benefits
achieved through improved consistency.

I agree after thinking about the whole thing a bit more.

I'd say this solidifies "<branch>" as, hopefully, our best choice,
as already proposed above.

I hope we'll eventually produce a great git-branch(1) man page together.
After that's completed, I have some more plans for improving git-branch,
by introducing some additional operations.

Maybe, :) but again, spending a few additional words to describe that
might actually be beneficial.  We'll see how it goes.
