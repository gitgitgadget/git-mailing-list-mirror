Oh, thanks for clarifying that I didn't realize we set "origin" to point 
to the bundle. That means this patch creates a promisor remote config 
pointing to a bundle that does not contain the missing objects. As Junio 
said that doesn't make much sense to me as the point of the promisor 
config is to allow git to lazily fetch the missing objects.

Best Wishes
