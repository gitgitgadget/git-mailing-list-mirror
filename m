Actually this is full merge + commit surgery (as if you did merge with
--no-commit, then deleted MERGE_HEAD); the state of worktree is as if
it were after a merge.

The `git subtree` command (from contrib) allows yet another way: it
squashes *history* of merged subproject (as if with interactive rebase
'squash'), then merges this squash commit.

Now I know why this feature is here...
