After running through the git test suite, it turns out that this particular need has gone away as of the latest OS releases. The test results without the trap '' EXIT are identical to that with the trap (6 breaks that look completion code handling-related on the platform). I'm going to drop the need for this and repackage the entire set of patches applying everyone's comments and removing this (4/6) and the GCC attribute (1/6) patch. This will be followed-up with generalizing the setbuf and tar patches for a broader audience, but I need a bit more time for that generalization.

Please accept my thanks and expect the updated set tomorrow, which will be sufficient to bring the NonStop NSE, NSX, and NSV platforms into the common code-base for git at long last.

Cheers,
Randall
