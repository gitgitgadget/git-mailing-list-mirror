Yeah, but it's an opinion that is based on a huge real world project with
hundreds of developers.  If Bazaar is ever used in a project of that
size it may just see the same type of issues as Bk.  As has been mentioned
elsewhere, Git users really appreciate the short forms it provides for
referencing commits, so much so that there is no reason to invent a
new (unstable) numbering system or attempt to hide the true underlying
commit identities.

Just out of curiosity is there a Bazaar repo of the Linux kernel available
somewhere?
