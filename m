Be it as it may...

As I've told you before it happens at least in gnome-terminal (and thus
presumably and VTE based terminal), xterm, xfce4-terminal and konsole
(all current versions of Debian unstable)... with less as of Debian
unstable as well as 643.

That affects at least on major distro, and there's a good chance that
it affects any other distro based on Debian (*buntu, etc.).


I further tried on SLES 15 with both gnome-terminal 3.42.2 and xterm
330 as well as less 530.

Even tried with the terminal emulator started via env -i and only TERM
set manually.


*All* cases affected by the same problem I've described before.


Same with the command you've used in your follow-up post, here a video
of it in HD:

Which is fine - and as I've said: I personally also tend to prefer it
like that - but even if the above would be just some bug (which however
seems to affect all systems I could test on a short notice, except
yours)... one can IMO still not generally say whether on or the other
behaviour is generally accepted to be the better one.

Even if output may be just chopped of and thus ambiguously incomplete,
some people may still prefer to have rather no output at all.

And in fact:
This is the default mode of less alone.

Well may be, but seems unlikely from my PoV, given that I've now tested
even on other distros and systems not under my control.



Anyway... I think this got a bit too off-topic here :-D


Cheers,
Chris.
