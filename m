Thanks for working on this. I admit that I don't generally read Rev News
very carefully, because usually I've already read the mailing list
threads that feed most of the content. :)

But I really enjoyed the "Developer Spotlight" in this issue; it was
nice to see some content that was not also on the mailing list (I also
enjoy the links section for that).

In more technical matters, you may be interested in:

I don't know of any problems with the current RSS solution, but 1 line
of code maintained by somebody else is perhaps better than many lines of
custom code. :)
