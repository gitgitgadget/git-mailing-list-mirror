I suspect you could do it with the python scripting interface of
coccinelle. We haven't relied on that so far (since it's technically
optional), but I think it would be worth doing if it makes impossible
things possible (it also would make some existing very slow things much
faster).

As far as the recursive rules, I thought coccinelle would always
re-apply rules to the result. So the two that Junio gave above would
work (each application of the second one would suck up another strchr).
But I also won't be surprised if I'm totally wrong; it wouldn't be the
first time I've been puzzled by coccinelle. :)

All that said, I don't plan to spend time on this. And I wouldn't really
ask you or anyone to unless they find it fun or interesting. It seems
like a lot of poking around for probably not that much benefit.
