OK, I'll look into this.

Would you be OK with Peff's suggestion?

I would prefer not to mix command and size in one packet as it
makes parsing a little more difficult.

If expensive tests are enabled the test suite will process data
larger then max pkt size.

I think this would be different for real streaming and the current
non-streaming... therefore it would complicate the protocol?!
I wonder if it is truly necessary.

Reject is already supported in v4.

I think Git shouldn't care about these details. If the filter
needs to tell something then it should use stderr.

Interesting idea! I will look into this for v5!

Correct!

I don't get this one. Git would restart the filter as soon as it finds
another file that needs to be filtered, right?


Thanks a lot for this write up!
