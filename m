Subject: Using two-dot range notation in `git rebase`?

Is there a reasonable way to use the two-dot range notation in git
rebase, particularly in anÂ  --onto situation?

In my case I have a short series that depends on both some existing Git
for Windows (GfW) patches (`main` branch), and some patches now in
`git/master`. I'm now able to rebase it onto the GfW `shears/master`
branch which contains both sets of patches (and one that was in the last
git release).

It felt that it ought to be possible to use a simple two dot range to
extract my series, rather than identifying the individual end points in
a similar manner to that used in the description"set of commits .. shown
by `git log <upstream>..HEAD`".

Or is this something that could be a project?
