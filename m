Yes, I think this is an improvement.

I naively expected this to go to >&4, but of course that is the
conditional "stderr or /dev/null, depending on --verbose" descriptor. I
have a feeling that we could get rid of descriptors 5 and 7 in favor of
3 and 4, if we did the conditional redirection when running each test,
instead of ahead of time.

But unless we are running out of descriptors, it's not worth the effort
(it's debatable whether we are; 9be795fbce (t5615: avoid re-using
descriptor 4, 2017-12-08) made me nervous, but it's more about the
special-ness of BASHE_XTRACEFD than anything).

Anyway, that's all a tangent to your patch.

I do notice that many of the existing "FATAL:" errors use descriptor 5,
which goes to stdout. I'm not sure if those should actually be going to
stderr (or if there's some TAP significance to those lines).
