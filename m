Thanks for confirming what I'm seeing. It's good to have.

That is what VS used to do (as best I understand it)

Which (Ninja) is the new VS default - classic latest and greatest
breaking backward compatible ;-)

The CMake is being run automatically by VS when it opens the folder,
fails to find the .sln, so searches for the CMakeList.txt file, so can't
add in the flag (with the current approach)..

Id agree about removal, but I'm not sure what should be in it's place to
ensure we have localised to being built within VS..

It's sort of both. It's that change of default generator that's tripped
up everything.

I think I may need to look into Ninja to see if there is anything there
that will help.

Ultimately the goal is to get the .sln to support other [Sourcetrail]
tools (which needs an actual build)

Basically, the .bat file gets all our library dependencies in a nice
packaged mannerÂ  (~Visual C Packager - vcpkg)
