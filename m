Yes, definitely. Will add

The current implementation checks the entire chain for GDAT, rather than
just the topmost layer as we cannot assert that `g` would be the topmost
layer of the chain.

See the discussion here: https://lore.kernel.org/git/20200814045957.GA1380@Abhishek-Arch/

It's one of drawbacks of having a single member 64-bit `generation`
instead of two 32-bit members `level` and `odate`.

We do not, will add a test at end. Thanks for pointing this out.

I didn't finish the sentence. Meant to say:

- Improve commit messages for "commit-graph: fix regression when computing bloom filter", "commit-graph: consolidate fill_commit_graph_info",
