Is this the root idea of the mail?  I think you should have told about

1. Why ubuntu needs an API like Firefox's XML DOM ?
2. Why C?
3. Why not Javascript?

and not about *how hard it is to get patches accepted* in the *ubuntu
mailing list*.

Am I missing some background story? What happened recently that you
are provoked you to send a mail like this? Can you provide with some
link to read more?

What exactly do you want Mr Torvalds to do on this regard? I think
more importantly, you should have mentioned *why* he should be doing
what you are asking him to do.

FYI, there are other OS like webOS which tried UI like that of
browsers with DOM and scripting APIs. Most of them failed due to
random reasons. Ubuntu community is having their own reasons for doing
particular things. If you have a revolutionary idea, I think you will
be able to convince them to do that.

Personally I think this is the wrong place to convey this idea.
