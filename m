For users, yes. But the context above is about people who are
contributing to Git, and writing their own new documentation. Presumably
they'd like to build it to see the output.

Again, this is about developers. Are there people contributing new
documentation to Git who are doing so on Debian stable, and would be
inconvenienced by needing to upgrade their toolchain?

That's what I was asking.

Leaving it forever does mean supporting xmlto forever, which complicates
the Makefile (and that support will bitrot if people are not actually
building it).
