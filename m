Yeah, makes sense. Your fixes are obviously correct. In other cases
we've added wrappers like sane_qsort() that do the size check
automatically. I'm not sure if we'd want to do the same here.

Either way, it probably makes sense to take this as a quick fix and
worry about refactoring as a possible patch on top.

Thanks.
