Hi!

I think I had tried bringing this to your attention before, but I think it was
without success.
The issue may seem purely cosmetical, while being easy to fix (is my guess):

When using "git merge --no-ff --no-commit ..", the pre-created merge message
always contains two empty lines in between the comment lines. However if there
was a merge conflict (being resolved) an extra blank line is added after the
first line.

In vi those empty lines are easy to spot, and I routinely remove them. But
maybe it's better not to create them at the beginning. (A "normal commit" never
creates any em√ºpty lines in the pre-created comment)

My Git version is 2.12.3, but the bug is probably quite old...

Regards,
Ulrich Windl
