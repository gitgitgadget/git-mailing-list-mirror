I have access to a server with enough disk space and its internet
connection should be something like 10 Mbps (or even faster). I can
provide you anonymous ftp access for upload/download (temporarily) and
http for download (permanent).

Or you can send me a dvd, but that would take some time (at least 1 wee=
k
because I'm in the Czech Republic and I don't expect that you are
anywhere near...) and I don't know if postal service can handle such
fragile things like dvds.

This is the smallest thing I can do for you...
