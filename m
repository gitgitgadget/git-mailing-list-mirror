I think many cases that use {litdd} would be better off using literal
backticks anyway (e.g., git-add.txt mentions the filename
`git-add--interactive.perl`).

There are certainly a few that can't, though (e.g., config.txt uses
linkgit:git-web{litdd}browse[1]).  I agree that "\--" is less ugly there
(and seems to work on my modern asciidoc). There's some history on the
litdd versus "\--" choice in 565e135a1e (Documentation: quote
double-dash for AsciiDoc, 2011-06-29). That in turn references the
2839478774 (Work around em-dash handling in newer AsciiDoc, 2010-08-23),
but I wouldn't be surprised if all of that is now obsolete with our
AsciiDoc 8+ requirement.

PS Late review, I know, but the patches look good to me. :)
