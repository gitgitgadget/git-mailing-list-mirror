hello,

1.I wonder, why the "user-manual" is so hidden on the (official?) site
git-scm.com [it is accessible at git-scm.com/docs/user-manual ,but is
not viewable in /docs ]

2.I did not receive an answer to my mail. Maybe it could have to do with
a possible stopped maintainment of the 'user-manual'

3.it would be for non-graphics-users to have the Git-Pro-book in
text-format.

thanks,
kalle

Betreff: user-manual: patch proposals and questions
Datum: Tue, 6 Mar 2018 00:08:55 +0100
Von: kalle <kalle@projektwerkstatt.de>
An: git@vger.kernel.org

The patches are attached.
Further some questions:

-see the explanations of the branch command, ca. line 280: wouldn't it
be better to use other words than 'references'?
-sentence "it shows all commits reachable from the parent commit": it
seems wrong to me. The last commit is also shown.
- chapter "Browsing revisions": it seems counterintuitive to me to have
two different logics for the meaning of "branch1..branch2" and
"branch1...branch2", according to whether it's the argument of `git log'
or `git diff'
-section "Check whether two branches point at the same history": 'git
diff origin..master' -> shouldn't it be rather 'git diff
branch1..branch2'? â€¦ or rewrite the example with branch1=origin and
branch2=master.

greetings,
kalle
