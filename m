You are plain wrong, because that is possible.  Did you maybe forget to do 
your homework before coming here and shouting around as if you were right?

To the contrary, these "bolt-on scripts" are superior to other solutions, 
because they give the savvy user freedom to do _anything_ a program can 
do.

You obviously do not understand Open Source.  If you have an itch, scratch 
it, or pay somebody to scratch it for you.

If you had problems pulling the code, there are two possible sources of 
problems: the program or a PEBCAK.

Ciao,

P.S.: Feels fine to vent for me, too.
