Just brain-storming:

  - It's probably a little easier to read, with the comments all
    together with the definitions (keeping in mind that some of these
    flags may need to be checked in several spots).

  - Likewise a few of the checks are non-trivial, with multiple ANDs, so
    it may be nicer to have a single registry (though the resulting
    "GIT_CURL_HAVE_X_and_Y_and_Z" are pretty ugly to me).

  - _Possibly_ it provides a knob for the user to say
    "-DGIT_CURL_HAVE_FOO=1" by overriding our auto-detection. But since
    most of these are "do we have FOO defined? Because are about to
    reference it in the code", I don't see what that override would buy
    you.

I dunno. I admit that I do not overly care that much. Handling curl
version dependencies was neglected for many years. If Ã†var wants to take
a more active role in handling these and this is convenient for him, I'm
happy enough however it works.
