I was not sure who/what/where to make a not of this.  I think it would be 
good if we could get a link to the various archives.  During an update of 
my system, a file was changed that cause email to me to be bounced.  I did 
not relealize it.  I was trying to find archived.  I thought I would start 
with our new main page.  I had to do google searches to finally find an 
archive.  The only problem is I have not figured out how to download all 
303 articles, quickly/easily.  You would think one of the majordomo 
commands to get articles would work.  They do not.

I thought I should remport my finding and see if anyone knew or could make 
changes to make it easier for us to find the archives.

Thanks,
