I don't think hosting it would be a problem (it probably would be the same 
kernel.org thing - OSDL is partly involved in maintaining it). The problem 
is the content, and the artistic talent.

_I_ personally have what I'd call "negative artistic talent". I think I'm 
occasionally good at designing beautiful data structures (and I think git 
is that, including the pack-files), but that clearly doesn't translate to 
any visual ability what-so-ever. None. Nada. Zilch.

Maybe the new Wiki can evolve into that. It sure looks better today than 
it looked yesterday (now, when I first saw it, it was so ugly that I had 
to dig my eyeballs out with a spoon, so that's not necessarily saying all 
that much ;)
