prepare-commit-msg is already called, a few lines above this addition.

That is correct for a post-merge hook. Why should *message validation* differ
between simple and merge commit?

Why is that new? Every commit in gerrit has a Change-Id footer, which is
generated by commit-msg hook. What I currently do for merges that succeed
without conflicts is unconditional commit --amend --no-edit just to
run the hook.
This doesn't make sense.

Most Gerrit setups require Change-Id in the commit message that the user
pushes. It is possible to disable this setting, and then you don't need the
Change-Id at all, but then you can't push a new patch set for the change
(unless you copy the Change-Id from gerrit to your commit message).
That's a real pain, I'm not aware of any public gerrit server that
disables this :)
