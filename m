Or I'm blind. The cg-branch-add command is right there. It also has a long
comment at the top of the script. Unfortunately the comment only describes how
to use the command, not what exactly branches are or how to work with them.

Clearly 'branches' are diverging branches of development. But if I have my
own tree, with several branches in it, it's unclear to me how to specify
which branch I'm actually working on at any given moment.

Be well,
Zack
