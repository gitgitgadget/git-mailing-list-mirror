Dear Johannes,

if ever there was a SHA-2 competition, it must have been held inside 
NSA:-) But maybe you are confusing with the SHA-3 competition. In any 
case, when considering SHA-2 vs SHA-3 for usage in git, you may have a 
look at arguments we give in the following blogpost:

https://keccak.team/2017/open_source_crypto.html

Kind regards,

Joan Daemen
