True, I didn't even think of that after your original got me in the
mindset of passing the buffer down. It's not too bad to do it this way,
and I agree with you that we are better avoiding static variables if we
can. Five years ago I might have said the opposite, but we've cleaned up
a lot of confusing hidden-static bits in that time. Let's not go in the
opposite direction. :)
