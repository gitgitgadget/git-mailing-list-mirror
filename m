Yes, we moved to v2.22.1 last night. I'll revert those commits on our
servers until we come up with a more permanent solution upstream.

Yes on that final bit. We could always fall back to (4) if the terminal
information is not available, but given that the benefit is mostly in
simplifying the code, I don't know if it's worth carrying around _two_
solutions.

One interesting bit: we have traditionally used \033[K on the _client_
side of the sideband demuxer. So I think in the "remote:" case we were
already handling this correctly, even before your patch.
