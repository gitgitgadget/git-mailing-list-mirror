What's wrong with the Cygwin port?

Is it just that windows developer hate cygwin because it's to
complex to install or is there any severe limitation?
functionality? stability? performance?

I'm personally only working on Windows if force to, but people
are asking me the same question that you have. Does git
seriously and fully support Windows?
