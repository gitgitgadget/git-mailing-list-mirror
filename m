By "tracking" I mean the ability to get the working-tree state to
match that of some remote-tracking branch and then be able to
periodically do some command, ("git pull"), to make the working-tree
reflect the latest state of that remote branch.

So the fact that at any given point I can say:

	git checkout origin/<branch>

and get into a detached-HEAD where the working-tree matches what I
last fetched, doesn't quite do the job. From there, there's nothing
like "git pull" to usefully bring the working-tree state up to the
latest. Issuing "git pull" from the detached HEAD state does fetch,
but then complains:

	You are not currently on a branch; you must explicitly
	specify which branch you wish to merge:
	  git pull <remote> <branch>

So, no, the current git-clone alone does not get me to where I'd like
to be.
