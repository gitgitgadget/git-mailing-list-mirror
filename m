I'm all for adding -m <msg> option to git-pull (and perhaps also common
other message generation options: -F <file>, --edit). I'm even for addi=
ng
-m option to git-merge.=20

Making "git merge" to be a synonym to "git pull ."... I'm not so sure.
I'd rather we don't lose the ability to give arbitrary refs ar "other"
heads like in

  git merge "Merge early part of branch 'topicA'" HEAD topicA~3

example, and ability (if there is such ability) to not include HEAD (cu=
rrent
version of branch) as first parent like in

  git checkout pu
  git merge "Merge branch 'topicA', 'topicB'" topicA topicB
