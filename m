Indeed. If we are worried about overflow, we would also want to assume
that it wraps at a multiple of 4, but that is probably a sane
assumption.

I wonder if just truncating bufno would be conceptually simpler (albeit
longer):

  bufno++;
  bufno &= 3;
  return sha1_to_hex_r(hexbuffer[bufno], sha1);

You could also write the second line like:

  bufno %= ARRAY_SIZE(hexbuffer);

which is less magical (right now the set of buffers must be a power of
2). I expect the compiler could turn that into a bitmask itself.

I'm fine with any of the options. I guess you'd want a similar patch for
find_unique_abbrev on top of jk/no-looking-at-dotgit-outside-repo.
