Wow, haven't seen that bug in a while[1]. The problem is that STDIN is a
filehandle object, but older versions of perl do not automatically load
IO::Handle to get all of the methods. This was fixed in perl 5.13.

We can work around it with:

  use IO::Handle;

at the top of the script. That should work everywhere, as IO::Handle has
been part of the core system for ages. But another option would be to
just turn on autoflush, with:

  $| = 1;

at the top of the script (though it looks like we flush $debug, too, so
we'd probably need to "select $debug; $| = 1" there, too). The "use"
command is preferable IMHO.

Yeah, we should be using PERL_PATH. Doing so inside the filter config
value is probably a pain due to shell quoting issues. But we could
use write_script() to get a local copy.

I'll see if I can work up a patch.
