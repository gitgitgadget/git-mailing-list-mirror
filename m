Hi.

I've been looking up free git hosting opportunities and noticed that
some information on https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/GitHosting
is outdated.
Here's what I've found looking at  some of the websites:
- GitFarm [ http://www.gitfarm.com ] is not/no longer free - it only
offers a 1 month free trial.
- Beanstalk [ http://beanstalkapp.com/pricing ] is what I'd call
"barely free" - a free trial is limited to 100 MB storage, 1 user and
1 repository.
- Codaset, as can be read at http://codaset.com/pricing , offers no
private hosting for free. (For me, information that "Codaset hosts
free, private and semi-private Git based projects" looks misleading in
that case.)

In general, I found this page very helpful - especially because it
contains more information, than wikipedia. However, the comparison at
the top might include more hosts from the "General software" list.

Hope this input helps.
Keep on the good work :)
