Thanks for these improvements. This diff machinery is new to us (Garima
and myself).

Here are some recommendations (to Garima) for how to proceed with these
patches. Please let me know if anyone disagrees.

>   [1/3]: commit-graph: examine changed-path objects in pack order

This one is best kept as its own patch, as it shows a clear reason why
we want to do the sort-by-position. It would also be a complicated
patch to include this logic along with the first use of
compute_bloom_filters().

>   [2/3]: commit-graph: free large diffs, too
This one seems best to squash into "commit-graph: write changed paths
bloom filters" with a Helped-by for Peff.

>   [3/3]: commit-graph: stop using full rev_info for diffs

While I appreciate the clear benefit in the commit-message here, it
may be best to also squash this one similarly.

Of course, if we create our own diff logic with the short-circuit
capability, then perhaps these patches become obsolete. I'll spend
a little time playing with options here.

Thanks!
