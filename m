I can personally give witness to Junio Hamano's discussion and
extremely detailed discussion on patches I sent out and it is more
elaborate than I would have given in reply. If he has not replied to
any of your patch that is because he probably missed it, a resend or a
reminder wont harm; we should all understand the workload involved
with a successful project as git.

At least get the name right next time. I hope Linus does not read it,
because I cant imagine what he would reply :).

I tend to agree with David, it is very easy and convenient to
criticise someone despite his brilliant work. if one feels that a
patch will be extremely helpful for one, he/she can easily take and
integrate it with his/her own codebase install it and use it, in fact
thats what I do as I have two installations of git.
