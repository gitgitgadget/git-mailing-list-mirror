Dear diary, on Fri, Nov 11, 2005 at 09:51:40PM CET, I got a letter
where Petr Baudis <pasky@suse.cz> said that...
> That file, with the so valuable (and so confusing) tables describing
> the precise resolution rules git-read-tree follows, silently sat in
> the corner and almost noone knew about it (well, I didn't, at least).
> This references it from the git-read-tree documentation, so that there
> is some chance that interested people will find it.
