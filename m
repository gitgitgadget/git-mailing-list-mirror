This documentation is most definitely appreciated. As is your continued
support and attention to our issues, not to mention just having libcurl
in general. :)

There are two related things that came up in this discussion that might
be of interest to you:

  - it would be convenient if libcurl provided preprocessor macros
    indicating a feature was present. E.g., if we could say:

      #ifdef CURL_HAVE_FOO

    rather than checking that "FOO" showed up in version 7.60.0 or
    whatever. That has two advantages. One, it's just less work and
    harder to get wrong. But two, it could help for cases where distros
    backport features (i.e., the version-to-feature mapping is not
    always 100% correct).

    Obviously that can't help historical versions, but maybe something
    to think about as new features are added.

  - Ã†var mentioned at the end of:

      https://lore.kernel.org/git/87tuiscwso.fsf@evledraar.gmail.com/

    that the tags in the curl repo sometime seem to differ from the
    releases.
