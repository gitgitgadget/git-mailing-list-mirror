I'll try again.

I like the git user interface. I like it a lot. (It's got a couple of
tiny things that I would do differently if I could start over, but
more importantly it has a lot of big things that I wouldn't have even
thought of if I had started from scratch.)

But with respect to the current topic, there are a couple of features
that the git interface is missing compared to something like stg:

1. Amend a commit that's somewhere besides the tip of a branch,
   (rebuilding every commit that follows)

2. Re-ordering commits that exist on a branch, (again, rebuilding
   every commit that follows).

And what I was trying to say in my confusing paragraph, is that if I
look to stg to add one or both pieces of this functionality, then it
comes with a lot of baggage. For example, "stg --help" lists about 38
sub-commands. And some of those are wholly unnecessary if already
using git, (4 repository commands 6 working-copy commands, for
example). While others exist only to allow a notion of "git commits"
vs. "stg commits" and translating back and forth between them,
(assimilate and uncommit for example).

Now, that's not a critique of stg itself. As you say, it can work
really well if you use it in a standalone fashion to track some
project.

I'd just love to see something more minimal, and incorporated into git
itself, to address the missing functionality. Right now, "cherry-pick
A..B" is all I have to suggest. But maybe later there could be some
sort of push/pop addition as well, (except that obviously the name
"push" isn't available as a sub-command).
