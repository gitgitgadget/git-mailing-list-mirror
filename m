Thanks for doing this. It's especially nice to get test coverage for the
progress meters, which have traditionally been neglected.

I'm a little late on my review, as it looks like this has already hit
next, but it looks pretty good to me.

My only complaint is that I think putting the new "private" bits of the
progress API into the header (with a comment) is a lesser evil than
re-declaring them in test-progress.c (if only because the compiler could
tell us if the two get out of sync). But I can live with it either way.
