For a long time already, we have tested Git's source code continuously via
Travis CI, see e.g. https://travis-ci.org/git/git/builds/421738884. It has
served us well, and more and more developers actually pay attention and
benefit from the testing this gives us.

It is also an invaluable tool for contributors who can validate their code
contributions via PRs on GitHub, e.g. to verify that their tests do actually
run on macOS (i.e. with the BSD family of Unix tools instead of the GNU
one).

The one sad part about this is the Windows support. Travis used to lack it
(Travis announced some early support for Windows, hot off the press
[https://blog.travis-ci.com/2018-10-11-windows-early-release]), and we work
around that by using Azure Pipelines (the CI part of Azure DevOps, formerly
known as Visual Studio Team Services) indirectly: one phase in Travis would
trigger a build, wait for its log, and then paste that log.

As Git's Windows builds (and tests!) take quite a bit of time, Travis often
timed out, or somehow the trigger did not work, and for security reasons
(the Windows builds are performed in a private pool of containers), the
Windows builds are completely disabled for Pull Requests on GitHub.

One might ask why we did not use Azure Pipelines directly. There were a
couple of reasons for that:

 * most notably, Azure Pipelines' build logs could not be viewed
   anonymously,
 * while Azure Pipelines had Linux and Windows agents, it lacked macOS
   agents,
 * etc

The main two reasons no longer apply: macOS agents are available now
[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/release-notes/2018/jul-10-vsts]
, and are public projects
[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/public/about-public-projects] 
now, i.e. it is possible to configure a Azure Pipelines project so that 
anybody can view the logs. Since I offered v1, Azure Pipelines has been made
available via the GitHub Marketplace, free of cost for open source projects.

I had secured such a public project for Git for Windows already, and I also
got one for Git. For now, the latter is hooked up with my personal git.git
fork on GitHub, but it is my hope that I convince y'all that these Azure
Pipelines builds are a good idea, and then hook it up with 
https://github.com/git/git.

As a special treat, this patch series adds the ability to present the
outcome of Git's test suite as JUnit-style .xml files. This allows the Azure
Pipelines build to present fun diagrams, trends, and makes it a lot easier
to drill down to test failures than before. See for example 
https://dev.azure.com/git/git/_build/results?buildId=113&view=ms.vss-test-web.test-result-details
[https://dev.azure.com/git/git/_build/results?buildId=113&view=ms.vss-test-web.test-result-details] 
(you can click on the label of the failed test, and then see the detailed
output in the right pane).

But maybe you're not interested as much in the presentation of test failures
as in the speed? Well, I got you covered with that, too. As of v3, the test
suite is run in parallel on Windows, cutting the overall run time to ~33
minutes (see one of the latest builds
[https://dev.azure.com/git/git/_build/results?buildId=311&view=logs], for
example).

This patch series took waaaaaaaay more time than I had originally
anticipated, but I think that in particular the advanced display of the test
results and the reduction of the overall run time was worth it. Please let
me know what you think about this.

Changes since v4:

 * Clarified in the commit message why BREW_INSTALL_PACKAGES is needed.
 * Added a clause to error out if we could not detect the CI type.
 * Introduced a CI_TYPE variable to guard CI type-specific code.
 * MAKEFLAGS is now actually configured in the CI type-specific section.
 * Moved the inadvertent fixup for GIT_TEST_OPTS from "Add a build
   definition for Azure DevOps" to "ci/lib.sh: add support for Azure
   Pipelines".
 * Backed out the Windows support from the commit adding the initial Azure
   Pipelines support, instead adding it later to help the flow of the patch
   series.
 * Clarified in "test-date: add a subcommand to measure times in shell
   scripts"'s commit message that one of the goals is portability.
 * Moved all of those CI type-specific definitions in ci/lib.sh after the 
   set -ex statement (as suggested by GÃ¡bor a loooong time ago already).
 * Guarded the Travis-specific way to "publish" trash directories of failed
   tests via base64-encoded tar files in the log; For Azure Pipelines, these
   are published as build artifacts instead.

Changes since v3:

 * Fixed the incorrect usage of cut -c that resulted in an empty trace when
   failed tests were published (except if the very first test case in a test
   script failed, then it was correct by mistake).
 * Excluded the previous test case's "ok" (or "not ok") line from the trace
   published with failed tests.
 * Renamed TRAVIS_BRANCH to CI_BRANCH already in the first commit, as we
   should not override TRAVIS_BRANCH with something that it is not.
 * Rebased onto current master to avoid merge conflicts with the
   recently-merged sg/stress-test branch (no, Junio, I really trust myself
   more than you to resolve those merge conflicts).

Changes since v2:

 * Removed left-over debugging code that would skip a good chunk of 
   t0000-init.sh.
 * Fixed the URL of the build badge.
 * Removed a trailing empty line from, and added a missing closing pointy
   bracket to, ci/mount-fileshare.sh.
 * Moved the "travis: fix skipping tagged releases" commit up to the
   beginning of the patch series.
 * The commit message of "ci/lib.sh: add support for Azure Pipelines" now
   mentions explicitly that the Homebrew packages that need to be installed
   on Travis' macOS agents are already installed on Azure Pipelines'.
 * Some commands were not guarded by || exit 1, i.e. if they would fail, the
   build would not have failed.
 * We now install gcc-8 for the linux-gcc job.
 * We no longer try to re-run failed tests with verbose log. Instead, we
   simply use the verbose log to begin with. Tests showed that it had a
   negligible impact on the overall run time.
 * The test_atexit_handler function was scratched; It would be the right
   thing to do, but is actually an independent topic (it was only
   implemented in v2 to accommodate the "re-run with verbose log on failure"
   trick)
 * We now use a new YAML schema (most notably, "phase" is now known as
   "job")
 * The Windows job contained PowerShell sections that were indented with 3
   spaces instead of 2.
 * The Windows job is now structured better, by separating different
   concerns into different "tasks" so that it is easier to see what exactly
   failed (was it the build? was it the test?)
 * The Windows job was split into a job to build Git and 10 parallel jobs to
   run the test suite with the artifacts built by the first job. This
   reduces the overall run time from ~1h20 (which was the run time by the
   Windows job) to ~35 minutes (which is the run time of the linux-gcc job).
 * The JUnit XML is now written using a test helper rather than a fragile
   and probably not even portable sed call.
 * Since we needed to determine the file size of the verbose log (to cut out
   individual test cases' log output), we now introduce a test helper to do
   that, and use it throughout the test suite (where Perl was used before).
 * It would appear that a recent change either in Cygwin or in the Azure VMs
   causes problems sporadically where the trash directories cannot be
   removed, but a subsequent rm will succeed. We now simply do that, because
   it won't harm the common case (where the first rm succeeds already) and
   because it helps the Windows job succeed pretty reliably.

Changes since v1:

 * Removed a superfluous eval.
 * Added the commit that fixes the Travis PR builds targeting master that 
   just happens to be tagged (see 
   https://travis-ci.org/git/git/jobs/424276413 for an incorrectly-skipped
   build).
 * The commit messages and the cover letter now reflect the name change from
   Visual Studio Team Services to Azure DevOps (and in particular, Azure
   Pipelines for the automated builds).
 * Now we're using test_atexit (which we introduced for that purpose)
   instead of hard-coding kill_p4d and stop_git_daemon.
 * The build should now also succeed for Pull Requests (where secret
   variables are not available, for security reasons, and as a consequence
   the file share cannot be mounted).
 * The shell scripted parts now use proper && chains.

     -    ci: move the Windows job to the top
     +    ci: add a Windows job to the Azure Pipelines definition
      
     -    The Windows job currently takes a whopping ~1h20m to complete. Which is
     -    *far* longer than the next-longest job takes (linux-gcc, ~35m). As such,
     -    it makes sense to start the Windows job first, to minimize the overall
     -    run time (which is now pretty safely the run time of the Windows job).
     +    Previously, we did not have robust support for Windows in our CI
     +    definition, simply because Travis cannot accommodate our needs (even
     +    after Travis added experimental Windows support very recently, it takes
     +    longer than Travis' 50 minute timeout to build Git and run the test
     +    suite on Windows). Instead, we used a hack that started a dedicated
     +    Azure Pipeline from Travis and waited for the output, often timing out
     +    (which is quite fragile, as we found out).
      
     -    This affects only the Azure Pipelines configuration, not the Travis one,
     -    of course, as Travis cannot run our Windows job: 1h20m is distinctly
     -    longer than the 50 minute timeout of Travis' free tier.
     +    With this commit, we finally have first-class support for Windows in our
     +    CI definition (in the Azure Pipelines one, that is).
      
     -    This commit is best viewed with `--color-moved`.
     +    Due to our reliance on Unix shell scripting in the test suite, combined
     +    with the challenges on executing such scripts on Windows, the Windows
     +    job currently takes a whopping ~1h20m to complete. Which is *far* longer
     +    than the next-longest job takes (linux-gcc, ~35m).
     +
     +    Now, Azure Pipelines's free tier for open source projects (such as Git)
     +    offers up to 10 concurrent jobs for free, meaning that the overall run
     +    time will be dominated by the slowest job(s).
     +
     +    Therefore, it makes sense to start the Windows job first, to minimize
     +    the time the entire build takes from start to end (which is now pretty
     +    safely the run time of the Windows job).
