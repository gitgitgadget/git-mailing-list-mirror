Thanks for the patience.
There is one detail missing in my description:
The check if a file in the working tree is clean:

static int ce_compare_data(const struct cache_entry *ce, struct stat *st)
{
	int match = -1;
	int fd = open(ce->name, O_RDONLY);

	if (fd >= 0) {
		unsigned char sha1[20];
		unsigned flags = HASH_USE_SHA_NOT_PATH;
------------------
Remove the "new feature":

git diff  read-cache.c
diff --git a/read-cache.c b/read-cache.c
index dd98b36..1f951ea 100644
--- a/read-cache.c
+++ b/read-cache.c

-               unsigned flags = HASH_USE_SHA_NOT_PATH;
+               unsigned flags = 0;//HASH_USE_SHA_NOT_PATH;
                memcpy(sha1, ce->sha1, sizeof(sha1));
                if (!index_fd(sha1, fd, st, OBJ_BLOB, ce->name, flags))
                        match = hashcmp(sha1, ce->sha1);

The the problem can be re-produced, and debugged with help of t6038:

Yes, the git-config(1) may need improvements, but that can go as a later path.

I may have written:
Merge a blob with CRLF "first line\r\nsame line\r\n" 
(which is checked out as
"first line\r\nsame line\r\n" 
in the working tree, and therefore clean)
and a blob with LF "first line\nsame line\n".

Yes

Not sure, if that problem isn't already solved.

This is my understanding:
- git checkout and git add are working as expected:
  LF in blob gives CRLF in the working tree at checkout (if attr says "auto")
  CRLF in blob gives CRLF in the working tree at checkout.
  CRLF in the working tree gives CRLF in the blob at "git add", when
  the new safer CRLF handling says so.

- Merges
 First the working tree is checked, if it is clean.
 I haven't digged deep enough to follow the whole code path,
 but that is what ce_compare_data() does, and it fails in a merge.

 Next thing is that the blobs are merged, and when a blob with CRLF
 is merged with a blob with LF, there are only conflicts :-(
 (Remember that both may have CRLF in the worktree)
 And here renormalize_buffer() comes in (only when "merge.renormalize" is true):
 - convert the blob with convert_to_working_tree_internal() into the working
    tree format (but do it in memory), and back to the "blob":
 - convert_to_git(path, src, len, dst, SAFE_CRLF_RENORMALIZE, NULL);

 Note the the "new safer autocrlf" is suppressed here, because of SAFE_CRLF_RENORMALIZE.
 The result is, that both blobs are now normalized, having LF.
 After that, they are merged.

This is my understanding: there are 2 different things involved in t6038#5:
- check for a clean worktree in ce_compare_data() # fails -> this is the problem to be solved
- When merge.renormalize is true: renormalize the buffers before the blobs are merged # -> works
