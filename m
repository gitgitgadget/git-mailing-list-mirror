I think the "lucky" case happens pretty routinely. The situation we're
trying to catch here is that server does:

   packet_write("ERR I don't like your request for some reason");
   die("exiting");

On the client side, we'll get that final packet and then see that the
connection is closed. So if we get EPIPE or similar on write(), that
means we're seeing the closed connection. Which means we'll _always_
have gotten the ERR packet (in this situation).

So the problem it is solving is that there isn't really flow control in
the protocol. The server might be aborting and dumping out an error
response while the client is still writing. If the server were to
continue reading the client request before closing the connection, this
wouldn't happen. And that's what an HTTP server would be doing.

But I think that's pretty tricky to do in our programs, where the
protocol framing isn't so structured, and deciding when the client is
done talking often involves parsing their request. E.g., imagine we die
with "not our ref" due to a "want" line. We'd have to return an error up
the stack to the code that is reading want/have/done lines, so that it
knows to keep pumping the socket until it gets to a break point, and
_then_ die().

I think by contrast, just having the client handle EPIPE more gracefully
is a simpler fix.
