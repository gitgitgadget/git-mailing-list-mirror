in a totally different direction...

how about code naming the release(s) with british slang words? since
``git'' is a fairly common british slang word (also used quite abit in
ireland too) to describe an unlikeable person. and since the release is
going to be cut on the 14th, how about calling it the "snog" release :)

not too sure how appropriate it would be to name releases after british
slang words as they usually have inappropriate meanings.
