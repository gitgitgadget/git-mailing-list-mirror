This is just a quick note to let people know that I'm taking a week off 
for vacation, and thus what I have right now in my git tree is pretty much 
what you'll see for the next week. I won't even have a computer with me, 
much less do any development.

Anyway, especially with the new diff-tree, it all pretty much does what I 
want, and I don't have any huge wish-list entries left. Now it's more 
about getting people used to it, and making all the scripts nice and 
friendly, as far as I'm concerned. Maybe in a week, you guys will have 
made CVS go away. I hope so.

It's pretty exactly a month since I started, and I really think you guys 
can do a better job by now.
