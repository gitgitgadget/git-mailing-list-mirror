Hi Jason,

let's belatedly fix the incredible misrepresenting subject line.

As you can see clearly from that page, the PNG in question is called
workflow-c@2x.png and it lives in /images/about/. Using the Ctrl+T trick
on GitHub even reveals the location in the repository:

https://github.com/git/git-scm.com/blob/master/public/images/about/workflow-c@2x.png

Clicking on the History link
(https://github.com/git/git-scm.com/commits/master/public/images/about/workflow-c%402x.png)
reveals that this file was first committed in
https://github.com/git/git-scm.com/commit/e640167a2687eae2d1ed30c5b0d003bfb09e88c3.
Since that commit message only talks about adding Retina versions (@2x),
let's look at the history of the original PNG:
https://github.com/git/git-scm.com/commits/master/public/images/about/workflow-c.png

At some stage of digging, you will invariably figure out that all of the
figures come from the ProGit book, the dictator/lieutenant one from
https://github.com/progit/progit2/blob/master/images/benevolent-dictator.png

A little more digging would have revealed that those figures are all
generated from one file: progit.sketch. Its history:
https://github.com/progit/progit2/commits/master/diagram-source/progit.sketch
indicates that you need Sketch3 to open/modify that file.

I found that I can open that file on Windows (where Sketch is not
supported) using Lunacy from https://icons8.com/lunacy and the diagram in
question seems to be on the page 05 - Workflows.

Please note that all of what I described is available publicly, I had no
idea about it, all I know is how to use the tools to find out. Which is
why I described it so that you can know how to use the tools to answer
your questions, too.

Ciao,
Johannes
