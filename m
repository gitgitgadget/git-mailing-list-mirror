v4 might be a little better. The issue seems to be specific to NonStop that it's PIPE mechanism needs to have setbuf(pipe,NULL) called for git to be happy. The default behaviour appears to be different on NonStop from other platforms from our testing. We get hung up waiting on pipes unless this is done. At the moment, this is platform-specific. Other parts of the discussion led to the conclusion that we should make this available to any platform using a new configuration option, but my objective is to get the NonStop port integrated with the main git code base and when my $DAYJOB permits it, spend the time adding the option. Note: __TANDEM is #define automatically emitted by the NonStop compilers. 

Does that help?

Sincerely,
Randall
