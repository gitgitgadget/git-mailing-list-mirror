Hmm, yeah, that's the "do care about auto versus true" thing.

That makes sense. Usually we represent "undecided" in such a tristate
with -1, so something that returned -1/0/1 would feel very natural to me
(and probably wouldn't need symbolic constants even). But -1 is also
error.

So a function like:

  int git_parse_tristate(const char *value, int *out);

which returned success/error via its return value, and put the value
into "out" would feel pretty natural to me.

I dunno. I admit I don't care _that_ much, but somehow Ã†var's series
have a way of sniping me into responding anyway. :)
