Well, I personally, also prefer it that way... but I'd also say that
just like in the case of `S`, this is not really needed from the git
side, but rather simply a user choice.

And since, if the output did not fit one one screen, the non-cleared
remains may likely be chopped off,... one could argue that some users
would actually prefer to have it cleared.

Same actually here, at least strictly speaking, ... though I (and
probably everybody else?) would really hate it, if that was removed. ^^


Anyway... that's no request from my side to change the default. I just
wanted to know whether that don't-clear-the-screen part was the
motivation for the `X`.


In case someone cares, I've asked less upstream whether there's a way
to have VTE scrolling work with -X:

Thanks,
