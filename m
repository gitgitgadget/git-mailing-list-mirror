Right. This technique does not help at all if you use --sort. I do think
it's reasonable to rely on the sorted output of the for_each_ref()
functions; other parts of Git likely do as well, so I think we'd try
pretty hard to maintain that (and no, it's not a filesystem thing; we do
make sure to sort it ourselves; see the calls to sort_ref_dir()).

I think it's just because pretty_print_ref() does not take a "flag"
parameter for the caller. So it never sees that REF_ISSYMREF is set.

There aren't many callers of that function, so I think nobody ever
really noticed. But you can see the bug like this:

  git init repo
  cd repo
  
  git commit --allow-empty -m foo
  git tag -s -m bar annotated &&
  git symbolic-ref refs/tags/symref refs/tags/annotated
  
  # this is ok; ref-filter handles the flags
  git tag --list --format='list: %(refname) %(symref)'
  
  # not ok; we do not tell the formatter about the flags, so it does
  # not notice that "symref" is a symref
  git tag --verify --format='verify: %(refname) %(symref)' annotated symref

I notice that the --verify output also shows the short refname, which
makes me wonder if %(symref) would have other bugs there (because it
has to re-resolve the ref to come up with the symref destination).

Right. It would only be helped by the "quick" formats in the second
patch (and by skipping the malloc/free of the individual
ref_array_items).
