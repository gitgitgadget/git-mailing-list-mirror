A few things:

1. Please put your responses at the end, by convention, for this distribution list so that I don't have to reformat the message each time ðŸ˜‰
2. You cannot assume that a flag in one command is going to do the same thing in another command. -f in checkout means one thing. -f in branch means something different. It is dangerous to conflate the meaning of flags between commands.
3. git branch -f is used to force a branch move on a branch that you do not have checked out, so mixing these is semantically incorrect. git branch -f will deliberately fail if you try to use it on the branch that is checked out. This is correct behaviour.
4. git checkout -f means to do the checkout even if the HEAD and working index do not match and has nothing to do with branch creation. These are entirely different meanings and must not be "blended" into one concept.
5. Your expectation of the functionality is different from what git is providing.

git checkout -b name creates a branch. The -f flag, which deals with index vs. HEAD, really has no usefulness with what you are trying to do. Perhaps we should throw an error saying -f and -b make no sense when used together, but I suspect there is a subtle reason for keeping that capability. It is NOT what you are intending.

git checkout -b -f is a SYNTAX error on part of the operator error, and git is correct to issue a Fatal error message about it. At best, git checkout -b "branch" -f is correct, but not meaningful.

If you are trying to script a situation where git checkout will work regardless of whether the branch exists or not, use git show-ref. Then your script can use git checkout -b "branch" if the branch does not exist, and git checkout -f "branch" if it does. You might get unpredictable results using -f anyway in this case because of the mismatch above.
