You mean this thread[1] in which I sent 14 mails directly to you? Yeah,
I din't engage in that discussion at all!

And the point I was making is that if I manage to show the community was
wrong in some thing (as you claimed), that community wouldn't include
you.

I can show you evidence of how that's a blatant lie. Just two days ago I
changed my mind because somebody provided a good argument.

But I'm not going to bother any more with you, you are just spreading
lies and tainting the discussion.
