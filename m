I've setup a code.google.com project for egit:

  http://code.google.com/p/egit/

it is currently only for the issue tracker, which now contains my
internal list of 12 issues that I know about and didn't want to
lose track of.

There's a wiki page on how I got the Mylyn connector configured:

  http://code.google.com/p/egit/wiki/ConfiguringMylyn

and that's really the only reason the wiki feature is enabled on
the project.

As a side note, we have finally earned the egit_sux content tag on
repo.or.cz's gitweb.
