Nice, I didn't know you could do comma-separation here. ;)

I always just built the various sanitizers separately since I was
testing whether each one worked. But if we can get UBSan to build
cleanly, I agree that "make SANITIZE=address,undefined test" would be a
nice thing to run periodically.

The implementation is convoluted in the way that "make" usually forces
us into. ;)

I would have written it as:

  ifeq ($findstring $(SANITIZERS), undefined), undefined)

but I think your version:

  1. Isn't fooled by superstrings like a potential undefined-foo
     sanitizer.

  2. Handles SANITIZE=undefined,undefined correctly.

Neither are expected, but it doesn't hurt to be a bit more robust.
