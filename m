You can do this with the current protocol:

packet:          git< 0000
packet:          git< result=reject\n

Admittedly the flush packet could be consider overhead but I think
that is neglectable.

Also already supported with the following sequence:

packet:          git< HALF_WRITTEN_ERRONEOUS_CONTENT
packet:          git< 0000
packet:          git< result=error\n

I understand your argument. However, I think "0000" indicates 
"I have nothing for you" and therefore I think it would be OK in the
reject case.

I am not sure I can follow you here. Which actor are you referring to when
you write "client" -- Git, right? If the response is rejected right away
then Git just needs to read a single flush. If the response experiences
an error only later, then the filter wouldn't know about the error when
it starts sending. Therefore I don't see how an error code up front could
make it easier for Git.
