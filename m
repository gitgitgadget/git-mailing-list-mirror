This seems reasonable, and I very much agree on the zero-ing (even
though it _shouldn't_ matter due to the "undefined" rule). That also
makes it safe to clear() multiple times, which is a nice property.

For the callers that actually pick the values out, I think it might be a
little less error-prone if they actually copied the strings and then
called clear_repository_format(). That avoids leaks of values that they
didn't know or care about (and the cost of an extra strdup for
repository setup is not a big deal).

Something like this on top of your patch, I guess (with the idea being
that functions which return an error would clear the format, but a
"successful" one would get returned back up the stack to
setup_git_directory_gently(), which then clears it before returning.
