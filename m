I've taken a professional interest in the index lately, and I've been trying
mostly to learn about it and measure different operations. Along the way,
I've seen some possible improvements in documentation, behavior, and
tracing.

This series collects most of my thoughts so far, including:

 1. Adding extra trace2 regions and statistics (similar to [1]) (Patches
    1-5).
 2. Update documentation about the cached tree extension (Patches 6-7).
 3. Improved the performance of verify_cache() (Patches 8-9).

Thanks, -Stolee

UPDATES IN V3
=============

 * Added a patch that fixes previous uses of "cached tree"

 * Updated preamble patch with typos and semantic corrections.

Derrick Stolee (9):
  tree-walk: report recursion counts
  unpack-trees: add trace2 regions
  cache-tree: use trace2 in cache_tree_update()
  cache-tree: trace regions for I/O
  cache-tree: trace regions for prime_cache_tree
  index-format: use 'cache tree' over 'cached tree'
  index-format: update preamble to cache tree extension
  index-format: discuss recursion of cached-tree better
  cache-tree: speed up consecutive path comparisons

RenÃ© Scharfe (1):
  cache-tree: use ce_namelen() instead of strlen()
