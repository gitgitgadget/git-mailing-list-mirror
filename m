If I understand correctly bzr came to life much earlier than Monotone,
Mercurial and Git but it was in beta stages very long. Bazaar-NG
"repositories" to group bunch of "branches" seems inspoted by hg or git=

Git (and probably Mercurial) was inspired both by BitKeeper and Monoton=
e.
Monotone started to be reasonable fast around time when Git and Mercuri=
al
came to be.

P.S. I'd like very much to see "history of SCM", with links denoting
borrowing of ideas, similar to the "history of UNIX" graphs...
