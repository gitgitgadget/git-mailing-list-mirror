First, I think 65 questions is quite many, and I'd rather not add new
questions to the survey. Besides, git hosting service belongs to area of
git auxillary; we don't have any other questions about miscelaneus git
tools, or wishes for git support in tools (like bugtracker or hosting
service).

Second, the question is a bit ambiguous: is "No" mean "no need for git
hosting service, or not using git hosting service?

BTW. there are a few free OSS git hosting services, http://repo.or.cz
I think the most prominent: see http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/GitProjects

Third, the survey is (among others) meant to help git commuinity develop git
to be better. This question is not about this.

So, I think I wont be ading this queation, unless somebody convinces me...
