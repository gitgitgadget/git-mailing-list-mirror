And here it is for convenience. I think this is worth doing, as it
avoids occasional 60-second hangs in the test suite (and I confirmed
that with the "fail if it takes more than 5 seconds" hack I showed
earlier).

Subject: [PATCH] t5562: chunked sleep to avoid lost SIGCHILD

If was found during stress-test run that a test may hang by 60 seconds.
It supposedly happens because SIGCHILD was received before sleep has
started.

Fix by looping by smaller chunks, checking $exited after each of them.
Then lost SIGCHILD would not cause longer delay than 1 second.
