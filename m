Yeah, I suspected that may be the case. But IMHO it is a poor use of
strbufs if you have to dig that far to see whether the code leaks or
not. The whole point of strbufs is to make string handling and memory
ownership more obviously correct.

Just skimming the history, I think it's mostly an artifact of the
function was slowly converted over the years.
