It looks like https://github.com/AI-metrics/AI-metrics.

I notice it has a .gitattributes file with:

  *.ipynb filter=clean_ipynb

There's a config snippet in the repo with:

  [filter "clean_ipynb"]
    clean = ipynb_drop_output
    smudge = cat

and the drop_output script is included. From the paste we can see that
Peter was at commit c464aaa. Checking out that commit and running the
script shows that it produces the differences that Git is showing.

The problem is that the currently committed contents do not match the
output of the clean filter. So even when "git reset --hard" puts the
content from the repository back into the working tree (putting it
through the smudge filter, which is a noop), running the clean filter on
the result will always have a difference. Either the filter needs to be
disabled, or the cleaned contents committed.
