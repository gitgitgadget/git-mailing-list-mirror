"git rm" works the same way that the UNIX rm command has worked, for 40+
years now.  Very simple, very well designed, and very intuitive (IMO).

The major difference is the ability to handle globbing patterns, which
UNIX rm doesn't do.  Maybe the way this is implemented is a little
confusing, although I just read the man page and it seemed pretty clear
to me.

If you don't use glob patterns (or more specifically if you let the
shell handle glob patterns, which is how I always do it) then there is
really nothing bizarre about "git rm".  Maybe you could be more precise
in your criticism.
