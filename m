The current design of the format (TOC first) does require that we can
predict the chunk sizes before we start writing the file. But also this
has _some_ desirable properties for the writer. Specifically, we keep
the file write handle for a smaller amount of time. How valuable is that?

Changing the TOC location would require a version increment in the file
formats, which is a bit painful.

I understand why the ZIP format does this, it is trying to stream data
through a compression algorithm and cannot store the result in memory
before writing. Perhaps we would want to consider that as a way to
reduce the memory load for things like changed-path Bloom filters, but
let's wait for that to be an actually noticeable problem before making
the change.

The TOC location is definitely optimized for readers, who are already
reading the initial header to discover some info about the file.

The chunk-based format is really optimized for _structured data_ where
these sizes are mostly predictable. The chunk sizes that are not
predictable are things like the "extra edges" or changed-path Bloom
filter data, but that data is indexed by a structured chunk.

A natural fit for the chunk-based format is the reachability bitmap
format, since the current format requires a scan to discover which
commits have bitmaps. If we used chunks, then we could quickly
search a lookup table for the commits that have bitmaps, then navigate
to the binary data chunk for the bitmap itself.
