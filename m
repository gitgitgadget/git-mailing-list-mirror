Dear Authors,

We would like to invite you to organize a Special Session or a Workshop

www.cscc.co in conjuction with several parallel conferences of INASE.org

We would like to invite you also to present an Invited Lecture (you know the privileges
from my former invitations) in CSCC.org and/org in 
INASE.org Conferences

* Continuum Mechanics, * Mechatronics and Robotics, Structural Analysis
* Energy, Environment, Development and Economics
* Civil Engineering, * Water Resources, Hydraulics & Hydrology
* Geology and Seismology, * Education and Modern Educational Technologies 
* Materials, * Industrial Engineering, * Maritime and Naval Science and Engineering

CSCC.org  and INASE.org  received more than 1400 papers in July of 2014. From them after
evaluation about 600 papers were accepted. See photos from 2014:
inase-news.blogspot.com/2014/12/post-conference-report-inase_15.html 

The deadline for paper submission for Special Sessions and Workshops of CSCC.co and
