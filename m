It's a fair question.  If you look at all the options in 
Documentation/merge-config.txt, you will see many merge specific 
settings.  I think the ability to control these settings separately is 
pretty well established.

In commit 2a2ac926547 when merge.renamelimit was added, it was decided 
to have separate settings for merge and diff to give users the ability 
to control that behavior.  In this particular case, it will default to 
the value of diff.renamelimit when it isn't set.  That isn't consistent 
with the other merge settings.

Changing that behavior across the rest of the merge settings is outside 
the scope of this patch.  I don't have a strong opinion as to whether 
that is a good or bad thing.
