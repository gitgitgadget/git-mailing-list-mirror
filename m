I think part of the problem is that git_tag_config() is pretty eager to
parse the ref format. You can similarly see:

  $ git -c tag.sort=foobar tag -h
  fatal: unknown field name: foobar

If git_tag_config() just kept strings, and then we later fed them to
a parser (when we knew they were needed), that would be an appropriate
time to bail.

We do something similar with verify_ref_format(); it is just a string
until we know we are ready to use it. But here, the format that is being
used for sorting gets fed early to parse_ref_sorting(). I guess it is a
bit more complicated, because it is generating a linked list. But maybe
it could generate a list of to-be-parsed entries, with a function like
verify_sort_format() to validate them.
