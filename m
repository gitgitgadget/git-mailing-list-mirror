Hi,
I was adviced on the IRC channel to send my feature requests here...

I have two feature requests:
1. a bugzilla to place feature requests.
2. All the stored "views" that can be created and placed under the 
"view" menu should be unique for each repository.

Currently I am starting to use git for a few projects, and I've found 
that my named view list is growing.. too much.  I think that there 
should be a foluder in the .git directory that contains a list of the 
named views so that a person's menu isn't flooded with entries relating 
to different repositories..

Regards,
Pierre
