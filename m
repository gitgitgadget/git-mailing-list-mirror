Junio,

Thanks for the careful explanation.

Heh. We dropped back to the identical example with our
crossed-in-flight messages.

Yes. And this was in fact the question I had asked in IRC. How to get
the diff again when I realize the file I updated is wrong.

And as you point out, git-unresolve does just the trick here.

The question I asked in my latest message is basically just "Shouldn't
there be a way to get the diff from the several parents to the
index?". That's slightly different, but it is the functionality I was
looking for when I was trying to recover from my update-of-botched-merge.

And its useful separately as part of the pre-commit-review I've said I
always want to be able to do, (and as you designed "git status -v" to
provide).

So there's the final piece I'd like here. I think "git status -a -v"
should provide a multi-parent diff when merging, as should "git status
-v" after manually doing an update-index while merging.

-Carl
