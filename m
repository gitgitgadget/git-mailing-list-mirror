Fair enough, although I'm not planning to alter this or any other patch
now that it's picked up unless there's a real show-stopper (this doesn't
seem like one).

This is very useful information to have! Without the total number of
commits, it's impossible to know whether or not this is a win over the
BFXL chunk. But, since the number of commits is probably "large" versus
the percentage of boundary commits which is "small", it's almost
certainly an advantage.

I could buy that it might be misleading; I only picked this since it was
the opposite of "large". You could imagine that BLOOM_TRUNC_X means
"truncated in the direction of 'x'", but to be honest I don't think that
this matters.

I understand the churn of coming back to this after the topic has
already been merged creates more hassle, but frankly this series has
already gone on for quite a while, and it has been holding up important
bug fixes that are unrelated to the main feature.

So, I think that if it's truly misleading, we could revisit this after
the topic is merged. But, I'm not planning on changing anything at this
point.

Thanks,
Taylor
