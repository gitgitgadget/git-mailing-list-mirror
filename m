I suppose one man's joke is another man's troll. Is the manpage
generator too mean? I don't think so (I think it's quite funny). I guess
somebody could. But at some point all of these terms are open to
interpretation, and we're going to have to rely on discussion and
precedent.

I don't think step 1 would ever be "report the manpage generator to the
committee, and get it banned!". For one thing, we have no control over
their domain, and it really exists outside of our development community.
So at most we say "yeah, we don't like that; please don't". But more
importantly, I think step 1 is somebody saying "hey, this kind of seems
in poor taste", and then we all have a discussion about it.

I take political attacks to be things like "Everyone from Country X is a
moron", or "People who support political party X are jerks". You might
even have a legitimate complaint about somebody's politics, but if
they're not bringing their politics into the project, it seems wrong to
attack them over it.

I do think there's some grey area there, though, because there _is_ some
intersection of politics (e.g., a discussion about licensing could
easily get into discussion of laws and IP). But if people are talking
constructively about it, and not attacks like "the party you support has
a dumb interpretation of the GPL", that seems fine to me.

Again, I really think the point here is not to enumerate all
possibilities. It's to set some general expectations, and to make it
clear that we value the idea of having a genial atmosphere for
communication that we have a document and a reporting mechanism.

Here I'd go back to "discussion and precedent" from above. Community
norms are a moving target to some degree. Wearing a tie was
unprofessional at one point, and now that is very much not the case, at
least in the programming profession. I think we have to stay somewhat
vague and rely on the social interactions of the community to resolve
things (and again, this is more or less what the status quo is; the
document is mostly a commitment from project leadership to take
seriously discussion and complains about behavior within the project).
