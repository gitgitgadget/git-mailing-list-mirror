Subject: [PATCH v2 11/12] read-cache: leave lock in right state in `write_locked_index()`

If the original version of `write_locked_index()` returned with an
error, it didn't roll back the lockfile unless the error occured at the
very end, during closing/committing. See commit 03b866477 (read-cache:
new API write_locked_index instead of write_index/write_cache,
2014-06-13).

In commit 9f41c7a6b (read-cache: close index.lock in do_write_index,
2017-04-26), we learned to roll back the lock slightly earlier in the
callstack, but that was mostly a side-effect of lockfiles being
implemented using temporary files.

At that point, the behavior was still mostly the same as originally,
except 1) the file was closed (and possibly rolled back) a few
CPU-instructions earlier, and 2) the file was closed even if the caller
didn't ask us to close it. Case 2) is not very interesting since we
never had any such caller and the commit before this one removed the
possibility of asking to leave the lockfile open.

Recently, commit 076aa2cbd (tempfile: auto-allocate tempfiles on heap,
2017-09-05) introduced a subtle bug. If the lockfile is rolled back
(i.e., the temporary file is deleted), the tempfile-pointer in the
`struct lock_file` will be left dangling. Thus, an attempt to reuse the
lockfile, or even just to roll it back, will induce undefined behavior
-- most likely a crash.

Besides not crashing, we clearly want to make things consistent. But
should we roll back always on error, or never? The semantics which the
lockfile-machinery itself provides is A) if we ask to commit and it
fails, roll back, and B) if we ask to close and it fails, do _not_ roll
back.

We should note that commit 83a3069a3 (lockfile: do not rollback lock on
failed close, 2017-09-05) recently changed the behavior for B -- we used
to roll back. We might worry that our callers rely on us rolling back in
case of B. But we only did so for some errors, we never documented
anything, and all our in-tree callers (they are not many) `die()` in
case of an error. This is our opportunity for establishing a consistent
and predictable behavior going forward, so let's enforce the same
semantics that 83a3069a3 introduced to the lockfile-machinery itself.

Similarly, let's ensure that when we are asked to commit, that we always
either commit or roll back. Right now, we have some early return paths
which fail to roll back the lock.

So: Do not delete the temporary file in `do_write_index()`. One of its
callers, `write_locked_index()` will thereby avoid rolling back the
lock. The other caller, `write_shared_index()`, will delete its
temporary file anyway. Both of these callers will avoid undefined
behavior (crashing).

Teach `write_locked_index(..., COMMIT_LOCK)` to roll back the lock
before returning. If we have already succeeded and committed, it will be
a noop. Simplify the existing callers where we now have a superfluous
call to `rollback_lockfile()`. This should keep future readers from
wondering why the callers are inconsistent.

We still close the lock as we close the temporary file. This is what is
referred to as "1)" above. It does feel a bit unfortunate that we simply
"happen" to close the lock by way of an implementation-detail of
lockfiles. But note that we need to close the temporary file before
`stat`-ing it, at least on Windows. See 9f41c7a6b (read-cache: close
index.lock in do_write_index, 2017-04-26).

v2: Except for the slightly different documentation in cache.h, this is
a squash of the last two patches of v1. I hope the commit message is
better.
