I guess most other people keep out of this because they are sensible =
enough to not feed the troll, and instead focus on useful things. But I =
can't help it, I have to say this.

No, it is not true, and there is plenty of evidence that proves it.

But I don't think it's helpful for either of us drag up such "evidence", =
as it'll convince nobody -- indeed, I am sure almost everybody here has =
already formed a clear opinion on this matter. And I hazard to guess =
that the vast majority agree with Junio on this (based, again, on email =
evidence). Not with you.

Of course one can't prove mathematical theorems by a majority vote, but =
as we are not talking about theorems, but rather about judging whether =
Junion's behavior is considered fair or not, I think it is appropriate =
to. Moreover, if I look at e.g. the "staging area" discussion, you also =
bring up the "everybody but Junio and one other guy" argument =
(incorrectly generalizing from "those people on this mailing list who =
chose to reply" to "everybody"), so I think I am entitled to do the same =
;-).

(BTW, I am actually in favor of using the term "staging area" over =
"index")

you.

I have not yet seen Junio get "mad" here, even in discussions with you =
were I think most other people would indeed have gotten "mad" at you. He =
stays remarkably polite, despite the insults and dirt you keep flinging =
at him... If at all, it would seem that you are getting mad at Junio.

Actually, it is more like this: "Felipe disagrees with Junio, Junio =
disagrees with Felipe, Felipe insults Junio and in passing half a dozen =
other people." It is the latter point which makes the situation =
asymmetric, and indeed indicates you as the problem.

If your premise was correct (that there is simply a disagreement), then =
this conclusion might be correct. As it is, though, your premise is =
false. The problem is rather a disruptive person: you. Quite sad, since =
you seem to have some good ideas and code contributions! I am in =
particular grateful for your work on remote helpers, both on specific =
ones (git-remote-hg) and also on improving the whole remote helper =
interface. I hope some of this work can eventually be merged...

But at the end of the day, we most (all?) of us here are volunteers, and =
unlike what you seem to claim a lot, for most of us, making git better =
is *not* the number 1 priority in our lives... In particular, if working =
with you would make git better, but at the same time would give me =
ulcers, well, my choice is clear to me... Perhaps it wouldn't be best =
for git, but I don't think anybody (except, perhaps, you) would blame me =
for it. Or, for that matter, Junio.=20


@Junio: Thank you for being an opinionated but also very fair project =
lead, who listens to *constructive* feedback, and has again and again =
demonstrated through action a readiness to revise a position based on =
sensible discussions conducted on this list.
