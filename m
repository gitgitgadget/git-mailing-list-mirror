Hey Everyone,

I am proud to announce the first pre-release of Pyrite 0.01prealpha. You
can pull from git://gitorious.org/pyrite/mainline.git or
http://git.gitorious.org/pyrite/mainline.git ( I think I will use gitorious for
hosting since tuxfamily doesn't have an http clones, although I will
sort-of miss the RSS feed).

Why such a timid name? This is because it has taken me longer than I
wanted to reach a point where I felt others could reasonably use and
contribute to the project. There is still much work to be done before it
is ready for a general purpose release. However, I need to see if
people are really interested in both helping develop and, more
importantly, using Pyrite and I feel that getting a release out there will
help me gauge that.

When I started this project, I had a good idea of what I wanted to
accomplish but I wasn't entirely sure how I would do it. At this point I
have an idea of how the interface should be presented and I will work
to get it right. I hope people will have input on what improvements they
would like to see to the UI.

Other things that I want to do before making a general purpose release
is to tie up some loose ends like proper rebasing and a graphical merge
tool (at least support for external merge tools). That's just the tip of the
iceberg though since I have plans to also do a gui and a web interface.

Feel free to contact me about this if you are interested in using, testing
or developing.

Thanks,
Govind.
