Not sure how much of a disservice it would be.  I think of
SubmittingPatches as mostly a document for new git contributors, for
who I think we should make it as easy as possible to start
contributing.  Interpreting the output of 'git blame' and 'git
shortlog' feels like an extra hurdle for new contributors, especially
if someone is not familiar with the mailing list workflow.  I do
remember wondering exactly how I should interpret this when I sent my
first patches.

This is also my experience, as I am getting involved with longer with
the project I get more of an intuition who is involved where, and
'blame' and 'shortlog' start helping me confirm that and come up with
a reasonable list of contacts (although I'm still not always sure
whether I got the correct people or not).

But I don't know if people that are getting involved for longer read
this document much anymore.  So I feel like having the commands
mentioned here comes at the expense of new contributors, so I'm not
sure it's worth it.

The reason I chose 'git contacts' over git-related is mainly that it
comes available with git.  Mentioning both again makes things harder
on new contributors who already have enough to think about when
submitting the patch.

I guess in the end it comes down to who we think the target of the
document is.  To me it was always people new to the project, which is
why I think the single command there makes sense.
