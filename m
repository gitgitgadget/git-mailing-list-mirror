Doesn't:

  LSAN_OPTIONS=abort_on_error=0:exitcode=0

do what you want? I get:

  $ export LSAN_OPTIONS=abort_on_error=0:exitcode=0

  [no leaks, no error]
  $ ./git rev-parse HEAD; echo $?
  0

  [no leaks, error]
  $ ./git rev-parse broken; echo $?
  ...
  128

  [leaks, no error]
  $ ./git --no-pager show; echo $?
  ...
  SUMMARY: LeakSanitizer: 40 byte(s) leaked in 4 allocation(s).
  0

  [leaks, error]
  $ ./git --no-pager show broken; echo $?
  ...
  SUMMARY: LeakSanitizer: 35 byte(s) leaked in 3 allocation(s).
  128

In theory you should be able to just add "log_path=/tmp/lsan/output" to
that, which should put all the logs in a convenient place (and stop the
extra output from confusing any tests which capture stderr). But I can't
seem to get log_path to do anything, contrary to the documentation.

Doing log_to_syslog=1 does work for me. I'm not sure if it's a bug or
I'm holding it wrong. But it does seem like it should be possible to do
what you want.
