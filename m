While figuring these things out isn't /hard/ it can be tedious and time
consuming for those who are not familiar with the particular tool set
(as evidenced, in my mind, by the poor dev support for Git for Windows
because of the need to understand two operating systems and their
awkward interactions) - those that are familiar and understand the/their
whole tool set are usually the x10 folks.

Is there a middle way, given that IIUC there is most benefit on the
Windows side, that on the git.git side the Makefile could contain a
suitable comment directing those interested in CMake to the relevant
part of Git-for-Windows. Is there a part that could hold, and track, the
matching changes to the primary Makefile?Â 

Are there tools that track and compare CMake and Make variants, or at
least indicate any divergences to help separately maintaining the CMake
series?
