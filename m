It kind of works on my Vista 64-bit system--I do not see the shell
extensions in the native Windows Explorer (which is 64 bit), but I do
see the shell extensions in an Explorer replacement I use (Xplorer2)
that is 32-bit.

I've seen other oddities in 32-bit vs. 64-bit programs--e.g. my alt tab
replacement (Joe), which is 32-bit, works great with 32-bit programs
but cannot remove focus from 64-bit programs (IE, Windows Explorer,
etc.). Ironically, very few of the programs I use are 64-bit, so I get
by with the alt tab replacement.
