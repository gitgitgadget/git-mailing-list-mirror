Hi,

I would like to request your participation in a survey on
    Open Source Organizational Culture, 
which will provide valuable insight into how Open Source projects are run, how their participants act, how they might change going forward, and how particular Open Source projects compare with one another and with traditional business cultures. The survey will take 10-15 minutes to complete.

    http://bit.ly/osocas2014


Why?
----
The survey will be used as part of my thesis on Open Source Organizational Culture at BI Norwegian Business School (www.bi.no/en, or www.bi.edu), but in true Open Source spirit the raw - but anonymized - results will be open for all. So, your Open Source project will be able to massage and dissect the results any way you wish, and see how you compare with other projects out there.

Up until now, most research in Open Source culture has been based on mining mailing lists to find out how people act, who they interact with, and how projects organize themselves.

In this research we would rather ask the participants directly about how a project is managed and what should change for the project to be spectacularly successful.

When?
-----

The survey is open now through May 1st.

Where?
------

The bit.ly address brings you to the following survey

     https://osocas.2014.sgizmo.com/s3/

Remember that you can save your progress at any time and come back to the survey at a later point when you have time to finish it.

Who are you?
------------
My name is Marius Storm-Olsen, and I am currently working on a thesis on Open Source Organizational Culture. I've been an active part of Open Source for years, most notably on the Qt and Git projects. Although I have my own experiences to draw on in the thesis, they do not qualify for the Open Source community at large, hence the survey.

How to help?
------------
If you want to help, feel free to forward this email to any Open Source project you would want to participate the survey. Once you have send the invitation, please either send me an email with the name of the project, or update the table shown on

    https://github.com/mstormo/OSOCAS/wiki


I do hope you can participate, and thank you for your consideration!


Best regards,
Marius Storm-Olsen
