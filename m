Git tries hard to prevent the same directory from being registered to
multiple worktrees, however, there is not much it can do to prevent a
person from shooting himself in the foot by making changes like this
outside of Git's control. Thus, this seems like a case of "if it
hurts, don't do it".

However, "git worktree" could possibly do a better job of helping you
recover from such a situation. In particular, I think it should be
reasonably easy to enhance "git worktree prune" to detect this
situation and automatically prune the non-main now-bogus worktree
entry.

It may be possible to special-case "git worktree remove" to detect
this situation and automatically prune the bogus entry too, but I'm
quite hesitant to suggest that sort of special case both because the
implementation would likely be ugly, and it could lead to a plethora
of additional ugly special-cases as people discover even more ways to
shoot themselves in the feet.

If you have ideas about how else the situation can be improved, please
feel free to share them, as such discussion may shed light on
possibilities which are not presently obvious.
