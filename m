Thanks a lot Andrew :)

I think I should follow the general contribution policies and work as
usual rather than as a GSoC student. Write code, ask for a general
review here, update code based on the review and iterate again and
again to get the task done and I hope somebody will find time to
review it and help me out. I am still awaiting to hear from Jakub who
helped me out in the beginning with some comments and reviews on code
I pushed to https://github.com/jaseemabid/git/tree/gsoc.

I'd also like to add that I'm a newbie to FOSS contribution and I have
no prior experience with this. Please tolerate mistakes :) All I can
assure is that will try my level best to make this work out well.
