Thanks for sharing your insight.

A more important thing is what you are going to do about it.

There are people in the project who track bugs and patches and they are doing an excellent job, but it's inevitable that the larger the project grows, the more bugs and patches sent to the mailing list. There is a real risk that some of them may get lost in the noise.

The project can use capable project secretaries, and these people may choose to use an issue tracking system to ease their job of keeping track of bugs and patches. "A bug tracker" is just a tool and you need to have real people behind it who are actively taking care of the system and looking at the issues. Are you volunteering to make a difference by becoming one of them, or are you merely adding useless noise to the list traffic to make it more likely for bugs and patches to be lost?
