General overview of the idea:
Reference https://git-scm.com/docs/git-update-index describes 
assume-unchanged and skip-worktree bits and should include clear 
information on whether they are propagated to remotes with git push or not.

What problem will this solve?
 From https://git-scm.com/docs/git-update-index it is unclear, how 
assume-unchanged and skip-worktree bits work in relation to remotes - if 
they are local only, or propagated to a remote as well.

 From other documentation - 
https://git-scm.com/docs/git-sparse-checkout#_sparse_checkout or 
https://git-scm.com/docs/gitfaq, it might be deducible, but it would be 
convenient to mention it in 
https://git-scm.com/docs/git-update-index#_notes as well.

Have I thought about other solutions?
Use Google - it's not easy to find the fact by Google
Search for the information by on-page search - 
https://git-scm.com/search/results?search=skip-worktree and 
https://git-scm.com/search/results?search=assume-unchanged top results 
are not helpful, but I admit that from the bottom ones it is deducible
Write a blog about it - 
http://blog.stephan-partzsch.de/how-to-ignore-changes-in-tracked-files-with-git/ 
already posted the information: But no matter which option 
(assume-unchanged and skip-worktree bits) you choose there is one point 
to consider: The chosen bit will not be propagated by git push.
