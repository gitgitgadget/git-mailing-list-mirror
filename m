I don't know if I like co-mentoring; I always had the impression that this 
does not work all that well.

Nope, that is just plainly incorrect.

The most successful GSoC project we had was Miklos' builtin-merge, but the 
code had to grow to a state that both him and me were comfortable with a 
submission to git@vger.

The _communication_ should be open, and much of it on the mailing list, I 
agree, but _only_ after the student is familiar enough with the aspects of 
her project (including some familiarity with the source code).

I will _not_ force a student to ask questions openly that he finds 
embarassing.

Ciao,
Dscho
