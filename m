Alas.

What do you think of making the validation disabled by default and
using a parameter (see "Running tests with special setups" in
t/README) to turn it on?  That way, it should be okay for it to take
10 minutes because this would only affect such specialized workers as
choose to set that parameter, instead of all of them.

GÃ¡bor, if we introduce such a parameter, do you think it would make
sense for us to set up a worker that passes it?

I kind of like the idea of a "make smoke" that runs some fast
probabilistic tests for interactive use, but for CI runs I prefer the
thoroughness of running the full testsuite.  So for the problem at
hand, I prefer making the test optional and reliable instead of fast
and nondeterministic.

That would make it hard to bisect to track down bugs, so I don't like
it as much.

I agree.

It sounds like the codegen approach would be a nice way to do that,
but that doesn't need to block this step in the right direction.

Thanks for your thoughtfulness,
