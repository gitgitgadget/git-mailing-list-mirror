I think that's syntactically invalid. At any rate, there are clearly
three options for setting a bit:

  1. In the section header (+include, or Ã†var's includeIf suggestion).

  2. In another key (which looks pretty clean, but does introduce
     ordering constraints).

  3. In the key name (maybePath or similar).

I don't have a huge preference between them.
