Dscho, that's just not fair.

The fact is, stating what you wish for *is* taking an action. Starting to 
complain about people stating their wishes (which you have done several 
times) is simply unreasonable.

You don't have to *do* what they wish for, but I really wish you stopped 
complaining about people bringing up their hopes for improvement.

Complain about it when somebody asks for something *stupid*. Explain why 
it would be wrong to do something like that. But don't complain about 
people having wish-lists, even if those people may not work on them.

Not everybody is a "doer". It's important to get input from people who are 
just plain users, or hope to be.
