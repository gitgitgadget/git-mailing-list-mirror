I am sorry if I haven't put my follow up question in proper place. It 
was on top. My question was

So these removed or replaced is done automatically or as I understood we 
do merge and and see conflict and do changes as per necessary?

i don't want to waste someone precious time but I am reading book and 
searching my own in internet to clear my confusion. That is not clear 
all time so that's why I am using this forum. I am reading all replies 
and trying to get basic concept as I go.

Thanks All
Anjib
