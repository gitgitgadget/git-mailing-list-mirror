It seems like you've buried the interesting part here. This isn't just
for cleanup, but a bugfix that the oids in our virtual commits might get
overwritten by subsequent actions.

It seems like that should be the subject and beginning of the commit
message.  And then the fix is to allocate, and by the way we can do so
easily with this nice new helper. :)

I don't think there is any reason to prefer FLEXPTR_ALLOC over
FLEX_ALLOC, unless your struct interface is constrained by non-flex
users (that's why it is necessary for "struct exclude", for example,
which sometimes needs to carry its own string and sometimes not).

Using FLEX_ALLOC saves a few bytes per struct, and avoids an extra
pointer indirection when accessing the data.

Since it looks like you touch all of the allocations here, I think they
would both be happy as a regular flex array.
