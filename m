I can only agree.

I'm not a git developer, I'm even not a _real_ developer, I only hack
for fun during my very poor spare time but web pages, wiki and
introduction offered by Mercurial are really a lot nicer to what git
is offering at the moment.

Perhaps is just a silly idea, but would be possible for OSDL to host a
web site (www.git.org) where we can host pages/wiki an so on?
