Then let's repeat it with a more eye-catching subject, and cc all of the
people who have said they would mentor so far.

For those just joining us:

The Google Summer of Code application deadline is this Friday (March 11)
at 23:00 UTC. They will be looking at our ideas page at:

    https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/SoC2011Ideas

If you have any ideas, please add them to the page! Whether you are
available to mentor the project, or simply think it would make a good
project and want to inspire others to mentor it, it's appropriate to go
there.
