You are right. Running an individual test and ending it early would
lead to these leaked handles. This assumes someone is aware of the
GIT_TEST_FSMONITOR environment variable, so they are at least
interacting with the feature directly to some extent.

This is the hope. It would be nice to get to that point.

When a directory is deleted from under Watchman on Linux, the watch
is removed...eventually. I'm not sure at exactly what point that happens.
At the very least, Watchman will receive and process the signals for all
of the paths being removed inside the directory. Running 'watch-del'
removes that overhead.
