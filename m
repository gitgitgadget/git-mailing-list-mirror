Ah, second attempt. Originally misread the original code, and didn't 
understand what it was doing.

I get it now.

A nasty trap I hadn't been aware of - I was under the impression NULL + 
zero length was generally legal, but the C standard does indeed not give 
you a specific out for NULL to library functions in that case.

As such, NULL checks can still be elided even with your change. If you 
effectively change your example to:

     if (nmemb > 1)
         qsort(array, nmemb, size, cmp);
     if (!array)
         printf("array is NULL\n");

array may only be checked for NULL if nmemb <= 1. You can see GCC doing 
that in the compiler explorer - it effectively turns that into "else 
if".  To make that check really work, you have to do:

     if (array)
         qsort(array, nmemb, size, cmp);
     else
         printf("array is NULL\n");

So maybe your "sane_qsort" should be checking array, not nmemb.
