Good catch, I did not look closely enough at this one - V1 definitely is 
buggy*. I've decided I'll add a new variable for the list in V2, but I 
also took the opportunity to rename the original list since I think that 
makes it more obvious where that list came from in the first place.

* However I also didn't run into any failures when running the entire 
test-suite with this change, so I'm guessing this codepath isn't being 
exercised by our tests. I'm hoping to try and investigate this in more 
detail when I find a spare moment.
