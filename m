John is one of the Linux Foundation staff members that are responsible
for the system administration of wiki.kernel.org (and kernel.org, and
bugzilla.kernel.org, etc.)  They are *not* responsible for the
contents of the *.wiki.kernel.org; someone from the project has to be
the wiki maintainer.

(Note: the *.wiki.kernel.org infrastructure was originally set up at
my request, and the first such hosted wiki was ext4.wiki.kernel.org;
the second was rt.wiki.kernel.org, for which I was also the primary
wiki administrator initially.  I'm confident the policy on this hasn't
changed since those early days because LF sysadmins (e.g., John and
Konstantin) do *not* have time to police the various wikis for
spam....)
