The commit is now 26b7b76329e03252c2738d7af90b5c18db3e98e1. As 'next'
and 'seen' are rebuilt on top of 'master', the commit id changes so it
might be better to just give the branch name, here "ua/t3404-cleanup"
for branches that are not yet merged into 'master'.

Here also the merge commit is now
ecd980f7eb8f24fa6ca85e35288d02909b1ba64a, so better just give the
'ua/atoi' branch name.

> Review the Current Patch Series
> --------------------------------------------
> 1. Examine the Patch: Thoroughly analyze the existing patch series
> submitted to the Git mailing list. Understand its design and
> functionality, focusing on:
>    -  How the OS information is gathered and transmitted.
>    -  Current configurations and their implications on data transmission.
> 2. Feedback Analysis: Collect feedback from the Git mailing list
> discussion regarding the patch. Identify key concerns, especially
> related to:
>     - Privacy issues.
>     - Default behavior expectations.
>     - Cross-platform compatibility.
> 3. Consider User-Agent Integration: Investigate the suggestion to
> integrate the 'os-version' data into the existing user-agent string
> rather than creating a new capability. Evaluate:
>     - The implications of combining this data with the user-agent.
>     - How this approach might address concerns about telemetry and user p=
rivacy.
>
> Implement Default Behavior for 'os-version'
> ----------------------------------------------------------
> 1. Modify Default Configuration: Adjust the implementation so that by
> default, only the OS name (e.g., "Linux" or "Windows") is sent during
> communications.
> 2. Impact Assessment: Evaluate how this change impacts existing users
> and any potential performance implications.
>
> Introduce a Configuration Variable
> ---------------------------------------------
> 1. Define Configuration Options
>     - Disable Option: Allow users to disable the 'os-version'
> capability entirely via configuration.
>     - Verbose Option: Enable a verbose mode that sends detailed OS
> information (e.g., the output of the uname -srvm command).

Shouldn't there be a config option corresponding to the default
behavior (which would be to show only the OS Name like "Linux",
"Windows", etc.) ?

Also what if users want something more customized, like perhaps "OS:
Linux, Arch: x86_64"?

> 2. Documentation: Improve the documentation outlining how to enable,
> disable, and configure the 'os-version' capability. Include examples
> for:
>     - Basic usage (default OS name).
>     - Detailed usage (full OS version information).
