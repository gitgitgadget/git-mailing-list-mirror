There was GitTogether'08 one month ago, see:

http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/GitTogether

Some material is available from the "Speakers" section of the page.
Other material may be available from the wiki (perhaps=20
http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/GitLinks).

But there is no conference organization.

Regards,
Christian.
