Git has been accepted to Google Summer of Code 2008, our second
year particpating in this exciting program.

  http://code.google.com/soc/2008/git/about.html

There is a nice categorized list of the other 175 accepted
organizations listed here:

  http://genmapp.org/gsoc/mentors_by_category.htm


Students interested in applying to Git for this year's summer of
code should look at the program FAQ, and especially the timeline:

  http://code.google.com/opensource/gsoc/2008/faqs.html
  http://code.google.com/opensource/gsoc/2008/faqs.html#0.1_timeline

Student applications are March 24th through March 31st.  But you
can start getting active now.


Interested students should take a look at our ideas page and
application template:

  http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/SoC2008Ideas
  http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/SoC2008Template

Students can directly contact a potential mentor by email or #git
on IRC, or to start discussing a project of interest on the mailing
list itself.  All Git related projects are welcome, so if you have
an interesting idea not listed on our ideas page, speak up!


Anyone who has been here a while and is interested in being a
mentor, please contact me off-list and I'll give you the details.
We want mentors who are passionate about the student project they
are paired up with, and who know that particular part of Git well
enough to help a student who is new to Git (and open source) do
something really exciting this summer.
