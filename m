Having for a long time been thoroughly annoyed by our strict umasks, I 
decided to write a little program to deal with it, and naturally I put 
it in a git repo. After the initial commit 
(c0fa1db09bad112f7271378d907bf33d74c06f6b) I published it to my git 
space on our development server and cloned it out again (to get the 
nifty remotes things set up for free).

Then I noticed I had rushed it, as I usually do with hacks involving a 
total of less than 200 lines of code, so I had to make a couple of more 
commits to make it work.

After having pushed the fixes to the public site I went to have a look 
at it in gitweb, at https://devel.op5.se/~exon/git/

I was quite surprised to find that 'master' was still pointing to the 
root commit. After the usual culprits were excluded (permissions, bad 
paths, whatnot), I decided to try to clone the repo again to a different 
location.

Here's what happened:

devel!exon:~$ git clone softpub/mkpub.git/ mkpub
remote: Generating pack...
remote: Done counting 17 objects.
remote: Deltifying 17 objects.

remote: Total 17 (delta 3), reused 0 (delta 0)
  100% (17/17) done
Resolving 3 deltas.

devel!exon:~$ cat softpub/mkpub.git/refs/heads/master
c0fa1db09bad112f7271378d907bf33d74c06f6b
devel!exon:~$ cat mkpub/.git/refs/heads/master

devel!exon:~$ cd mkpub/
devel!exon:~/mkpub$ git push

c0fa1db09bad112f7271378d907bf33d74c06f6b

(yes, the repo only has 4 commits)

And that's where I am now. Note that *cloning* from the repo actually 
works, although I can't for the life of me figure out why.

Any thoughts?
