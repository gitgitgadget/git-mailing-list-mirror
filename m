I agree that if we are creating a new (optional) chunk, then that gets
around our versioning issues and could store just the offsets to get
the "corrected commit date" option instead of the backwards-compatible one.
By including yet another version number at the beginning of that chunk,
we could present a way to update this "second reachability index chunk"
with things like your interval mechanism with very little cost.

I'm not a fan of the flag file idea. Optional chunks are a good way forward.
That _could_ mean the metadata chunk, whose length can grow in the future
if/when we add more fixed-width metadata values.

The incremental commit-graph format is newer than our previous tests
for generation number v2, which will be a big reason why that old code
cannot be immediately adapted here.

The simplest thing to do is usually right: if we try to write a
generation number version that doesn't match the current commit-graph,
then we need to flatten the entire chain into one layer and recompute
the values from scratch. While it is _technically_ possible to mix
the backwards-compatible corrected commit date with generation number
v1, it requires taking the "lowest version" when doing comparisons and
that may behave very strangely. Better to avoid that complication.

CDAT is required as it contains more than just generation numbers. It
has the commit date, parent int-ids, and root tree oid. The generation
numbers _could_ be left as all zeroes, which is a special case for the
format before generation numbers were introduced, but it would be better
to have values there.

I share these concerns but also the locality of the data within the file.
As we parse commits, we need the parent and commit date information out
of the CDAT chunk anyway, so it is not difficult to grab the nearby
generation number. If we put that data further away in a separate chunk,
then it can be more expensive to flip between the CDAT chunk and the
GEN2 chunk.

In terms of your prototyping for performance checks, it may be good to
have a number of "GEN<X>" chunks so you can compute one commit-graph
that stores all of the candidate reachability indexes, then use one
of the chunks based on a config value or environment variable. I think
that would only be appropriate for testing if you are evaluating which
to build, so if you are focusing entirely on backwards-compatible
corrected commit date, this is not worth spending time on.
