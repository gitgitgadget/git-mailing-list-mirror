I think we want to be checking for "not a tree" here, which is later
added with the fix. But either we should have the test_i18ngrep here
initially, or we should add both the redirect and the grep with the fix.

I disagree with that rule here. We're not testing "cat-file" in any
meaningful way, but just getting some stock output from a known-good
commit.

Heh, this was actually the subject of much discussion before the patches
hit the list. If you can write such a one-liner that is both readable
and portable, please share it. I got disgusted with sed and suggested
this perl.
