Google granted us 3 student projects this summer.  We had 18
applications this year, and at least 8 of them were really
quite good.  Our summer of code mentoring 'team' (Sam Vilain,
Johannes Schindelin, Petr Baudis, Martin Langhoff, Martin Waitz,
Brian Gernhardt, and I) were really hoping that Google would grant
us more projects, as we really wanted to accept them.

Google accepted over 900 students this year, from a pool of over
6000 applications.  Competition for slots was definately fierce.
Organizations received about 15% of their total applications
as slots; Those orgs that were more popular (and received more
applications) were given more slots than those that were less
popular.  I guess Git isn't very popular.  :-)

I'd like to thank our mentors for their efforts during the
application review process, and all 18 of our students for applying.
It really was a very difficult decision for us to pick just 3.

So with all that said, I'd like to welcome our students, and
encourage them to get in touch with their mentors.  Though I
think Dscho might be in the process of moving between countries
right now... so he might not be too responsive to email for a few
more days.
