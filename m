My name is Andrew Paul a lawyer with A. Paul & Associates.

I found your e mail contact through an electronic search conducted by my Law firm and it gives me greatest joy that you are the type of person that I can trust to handle this project with me.

I have contacted you to assist in distributing the estate left behind by my client before it get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank where this deposit valued at $18, 000,000 and I strongly believe you could execute this dael with me. 

Kindly get back to me for more Detail.

Best regards,
Mr Andrew Paul.
