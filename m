It is nowadays very easy to delete accidentally created remote branch
with

      $ git push origin --delete origin/master

This rule depends on push.default setting, but it is a very simple
rule.  Simple is good.  DWIM is usually not worth it, unless program
can guess what you meant, and what you meant is always the same.

Such push doesn't make sense (unless you have a quite unusual situation).

Note that 'origin/master', that is 'refs/remotes/origin/master' is a
remote-tracking branch, that is a ref that is meant to track position
of the 'master' branch ('refs/heads/master') in the 'origin' remote.
Thus it should always be the same as 'master' in 'origin', or be behind
if you didn't fetch.

> Does this seem reasonable?  I can try to work up a patch if so.

Thus I don't think such complication is reasonable.
