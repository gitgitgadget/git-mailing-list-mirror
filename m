It certainly would. It would be 2nd level domain, not a 3rd level one.

Note, that none of the other vcs' have a homepage at theirname.org --
subversion is svn.tigris.org, bazaar is bazaaz-vcs.org, mercurial is
www.selenic.com/mercurial, svk is svk.bestpractical.com, monotone is
monotone.ca. So git-vcs.org would be quite good.
