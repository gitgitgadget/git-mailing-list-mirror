Yes. I mentioned this on IRC but should really write it on the mailing
list - I'm looking forward for the GitTogether to resolve any remaining
issues anyone has with git-scm.com and make git.or.cz probably
essentially point to git-scm.com. Since the old threads died away long
ago, if anyone - especially who is not attending GitTogether - still
dislikes some things about the git-scm.com site, please follow up here.

I think this last sentence is where we differ - for (most of?) us the
Git developers, 'the community' pretty much _is_ this list (with the IRC
channel as its casual extension). But I'm very glad to see an
announcement from the GitHub people here and I hope we will see more of
them. Don't worry about the occasional flames, we all get hit by them
sometime. :-) (Um, I personally think *I* get flamed much less than I
would deserve. ;-)
