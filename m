GÃ¡bor covered the "what happened", so let me say a little more about
the motivation.

The "foo" symlink is being replaced by a "foo" directory containing a
"bar" file.  We're pretty far along now: we want to write actual files
to disk.  Using the index we know where we were going from and to, but
not everything in the world is tracked in the index: there could be
build outputs under "foo/bar" blocking the operation from moving
forward.

So we check whether there's a directory there.  Once we are writing
things out, there won't be, but the symlink confuses us.  Nice find.

The crucial detail here is that "foo" is going to be removed before we
write "foo/bar".  We should be able to notice that and skip the
dir_in_way check.

Just my uninformed guess --- I haven't tried it. :)

Thoughts?

Thanks,
