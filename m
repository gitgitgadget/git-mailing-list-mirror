Hi everyone,

I don't know whether this question has already been raised, but everything is 
in the title.

As a day-to-day hard git user ;), I also have to manage files with different 
licenses I need to track.
As git handles all those files in a very smart way, I wondered whether git 
could also handle that information, at least somehow.

That would greatly make my day, and I do think several other people could
have the same need, too.

Do you think this might be relevant?

Best regards,

Yohann
