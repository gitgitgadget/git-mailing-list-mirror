Please don't ignore your dream.

It's just that this is a relatively high-traffic list most of the time
(in my limited experience), so it does occasionally happen that your
patch gets "stuck" somehow; it's probably only more likely to happen if
you're trying to contribute to something non-core, like gitk in this
case (simply because there are less developers "available").

The only thing you should do is try to get attention -- usually just
sending an e-mail suffices, maybe preferably with some more useful
content than "Up!". If it doesn't, well, try again (according to my
accounting, you did it actually only once so far, definitely not six
times).

I'm sure your patch will get the attention and handling it deserves (I
experienced similar problem not too long ago), so -- please don't give
up!

Thank you!

    [who is just a reader of the list most of the time, so can't really
    help you more with this]
