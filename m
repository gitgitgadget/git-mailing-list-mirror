I *may* be able to help a bit in the coming weeks, given that it's
reasonably likely I'll be using git-subtree for professional reasons.

However I'm not clear from the above whether you're suggesting that
someone should take over ownership from David, or merely help him?

And in either case, what would be your criteria and process for
accepting patches, given that ultimately you're still in control of
the repository?

Thanks,
Adam
