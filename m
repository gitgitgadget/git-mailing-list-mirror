Sure, thanks for noticing.

Ah, I see. Yes, this definitely *does* forbid that. My thinking when I
decided to give this 'PARSE_OPT_NONEG' was that '--no-split' is
confusing for users: does it mean "don't split" or "unset any split
options"?

This probably would be ameliorated by your suggestion below, maybe of
'--split-strategy', specifically (I could probably go either way on
'--format=split', but it really depends on what Stolee has planned
long-term). Then, '--[no-]split' remains clear, as does
'--no-split-strategy' (although I suppose that you could make the
argument that '--no-split-strategy' sounds a little bit like letting the
machinery use its defaults, which may or may not be true depending on
how it's implemented.)

But, I'm not sure that it's all worth it to add another option here.
This sub-builtin has a plethora of options already, and I'm skeptical
that there are a lot of real-world uses of '--no-split' in the wild that
we'd be breaking.
