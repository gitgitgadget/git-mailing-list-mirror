It's not clear to me that the existing completion actually does a good
job with disambiguation anyway.

If I have a tag and a branch named "foo", then in theory doing:

  git log fo<Tab>

should present me with "heads/foo" and "tags/foo" as options. But it
doesn't seem to; it just completes "foo".

But even if it did, those don't _start_ with foo, I have to go to some
work to back up anyway. I think we are better off just completing "foo"
and letting the command complain that it's ambiguous.

So even leaving aside the performance tradeoff, that seems like a more
sensible behavior anyway. And AFAICT, that's the behavior you'd get with
your patch (we'd get two "foo"s, but the completion is presumably smart
enough to handle that.

This is nice, though I think faster ref storage is another way to attack
the problem. This is much simpler, though. :)
