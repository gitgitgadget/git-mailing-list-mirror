From the trace I found in perl, we have gone past sleep and are hung at 
          close($out);

Commenting out the close() does nothing because perl still hangs on an implied close resulting from the exception thrown by die(). See my other post on adding GIT_TRACE and the changes resulting from that.

Sadly, the fix does not change the results. In fact, it makes the hang far more likely. Subtest 6,7,8 fails here, at close()
