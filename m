This is a great summary. Thanks.

In case it's not apparent from what follows, I have a bias towards
SHA-256. Reasons for that, to summarize some of the discussion the last
time around[1], and to add more details:

== Popularity

Other things being equal we should be biased towards whatever's in the
widest use & recommended fon new projects.

I fear that if e.g. git had used whatever at time was to SHA-1 as
BLAKE2b is to SHA-256 now, we might not even know that it's broken (or
had the sha1collisiondetection work to fall back on), since researchers
are less likely to look at algorithms that aren't in wide use.

SHA-256 et al were published in 2001 and has ~20k results on Google
Scholar, compared to ~150 for BLAKE2b[4], published in 2008 (but ~1.2K
for "BLAKE2").

Between the websites of Intel, AMD & ARM there are thousands of results
for SHA-256 (and existing in-silicon acceleration). There's exactly one
result on all three for BLAKE2b (on amd.com, in the context of a laundry
list of hash algorithms in some presentation.

Since BLAKE2b lost the SHA-3 competition to Keccak it seems impossible
that it'll get ever get anywhere close to the same scrutiny or support
in silicon as one of the SHA families.

Which brings me to the next section...

== Hardware acceleration

The only widely deployed HW acceleration is for the SHA-1 and SHA-256
from the SHA-2 family[5], but notably nothing from the newer SHA-3
family (released in 2015).

It seems implausible that anything except SHA-3 will get future HW
acceleration given the narrow scope of current HW acceleration
v.s. existing hash algorithms.

As noted in the thread from last year[1] most git users won't even
notice if the hashing is faster, but it does matter for some big users
(big monorepos), so having the out of purchasing hardware to make things
faster today is great, and given how these new instruction set
extensions get rolled out it seems inevitable that this'll be available
in all consumer CPUs within 5-10 years.

== Age

Similar to "popularity" it seems better to bias things towards a hash
that's been out there for a while, i.e. it would be too early to pick
SHA-3.

The hash transitioning plan, once implemented, also makes it easier to
switch to something else in the future, so we shouldn't be in a rush to
pick some newer hash because we'll need to keep it forever, we can
always do another transition in another 10-15 years.

== Conclusion

For all the above reasons I think we should pick SHA-256.
