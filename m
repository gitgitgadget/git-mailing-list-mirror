I think we've had this discussion before, a while ago. Yes, returning an
integer error code is nice because you don't have pass in an extra
parameter. But I think there are two pitfalls:

  1. Integers may not be descriptive enough to cover all cases, which is
     how we ended up with the strbuf-passing strategy in the ref code.
     Certainly you could add an integer for every possible bespoke
     message, but then I'm not sure it's buying that much over having
     the function simply fill in a strbuf.

  2. For complex functions there may be multiple errors that need to
     stack. I think the refs code has cases like this, where a syscall
     fails, which causes a fundamental ref operation to fail, which
     causes a higher-level operation to fail. It's only the caller of
     the higher-level operation that knows how to report the error.

Certainly an integer error code would work for _this_ function, but I'd
rather see us grow towards consistent error handling.
