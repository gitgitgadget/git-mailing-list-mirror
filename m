That someone was I. I appreciate that people study t/README and do not
ignore the sentence.

However, it does not apply to the situation because the path to the editor
is not "generated by a git command and checked for by a test".

That said, it is not wrong to use $(pwd) with test_set_editor, it's just
unnecessarily slow.
