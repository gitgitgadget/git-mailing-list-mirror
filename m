Just a heads up I've got an initial import of the current wiki up at
http://git.wiki.kernel.org - some of it was quite a clean conversion,
some of it not so much.  Please note that user accounts were not carried
over but edit histories were.  I'll work on cleaning up the rest of if
tomorrow, assuming that there isn't any objections to Petr's e-mail
above.  If there is I'm more than happy to drop the wiki if need be, but
I figured plowing ahead was reasonably easy and it at least gets the
ball rolling.
