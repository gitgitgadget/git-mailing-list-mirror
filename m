  SOrry, *I* screwed up. I did not checked first if the archived had the
mails, and it had. So as I don't see the mails come, it's definitely a
problem in between, and is not necessarilly vger.kernel.org's fault, and
I apologies for the noise.

  So if anyone sent a mail to the list (without me in Cc) hoping that I
would get the mail and never answered, it's time to send it again :/

  That is also the reason why some of my mails have been sent many
times: because I thought they were eaten at some point. That should not
happen again, sorry about that.

Cheers,
