This direction looks good to me overall. It's not pretty, but I think
it's the least-bad option.

I guess you'd plan to do that like this in the caller:

  if (date->local)
	tz_name = NULL;
  else
	tz_name = "";

and then your strftime() doesn't do any %z expansion when tz_name is
NULL.

I was thinking that we would need to have it take the actual time_t, and
then it would be able to do the tzset/localtime dance itself. But since
I don't think we're planning to do that (if anything we'd just handle
the normal localtime() case), the complication it would add to the
interface isn't worth it.

Now we're doing two types of munging: sometimes handling %z, and
sometimes the extra-space hack. I had to read through it carefully to
make sure we handle all cases correctly, but I think it works.

In particular, I worried about us setting "fmt" to munged_fmt.buf for
the %z case, and then later adding the extra space to it for the
zero-length hack, which might reallocate, leaving "fmt" pointing to
unallocated memory. But it's OK because at that point we never touch the
original "fmt" again.

Good, documentation (the diff order put the implementation first so I
scratched my head for a moment before realizing you had already
described it).
