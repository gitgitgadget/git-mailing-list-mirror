I think we've been talking past another on this item. What I'm worried
about is a potential future where the default remote isn't called
"origin", but something else. I for example quite frequently rename the
remote right after cloning because I add a handful of remotes, and
"origin" would be too confusing. So there is a usecase that may at one
point in the future cause us to make this configurable at clone-time.

Which brings me to the issue with the current design: if the remote
dictates the names of additional remotes we basically cannot do the
above change anymore because we have to assume that no matter which
remote name is chosen, it could already be used by a promisor remote.
Our hands are bound by potential implementations of this feature by a
third party, which I think is not a good idea in general.

Now I'm not against advertising a name and storing it in our config when
we create the additional remote, for example by storing it as a separate
key "remote.<generated>.promisor-name". But the name of the remote
itself should not be controlled by the server, but should instead be
generated by the client.

It's not only about trust, as explained above. It's more about not
letting server operators dictate how Git can evolve in that context and
not taking away the ability of a user to configure their repository how
they want to.

Partitioning the Git userbase depending on the Git version they can use
doesn't feel sensible to me. We have been able to get by without
breaking backwards compatibility on the transport layer until now. So it
would be too bad if this new feature would break that.

Also, the argument with a corporate setup cuts both ways, I think. If
the administrators tightly control the Git version anyway they can just
upgrade it for all clients, and consequently all of the clients would
know how to handle the new capability and thus the server wouldn't be
overloaded.
