Oh, sorry, I didn't mean it in that way. Of _course_ they should have come 
to us with their issues.

So I don't think git was doing anything wrong there, I was just stating it 
as a neutral fact, rather than any criticism - the hg people were involved 
(and I think they were pushing it), and the git people weren't, because 
they never came to us.

Not a big deal. I actually think we'll be better off with some competition 
to keep us on our toes.
