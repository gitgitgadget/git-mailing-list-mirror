Good to know that there are differences. I used clang for my sanitize
runs for the past few years (because of issues I had with gcc's version
in the 4.8 era), but just switched a week or two ago back to using gcc.

My impression is that clang is the primary platform for sanitizer
development, and so it would probably produce better results. We _could_
force "CC ?= clang" when SANITIZE is set, but that's probably a bit
unfriendly to people who only have gcc.

FWIW, I just did an UBSan run with clang-5.0, and it comes up with only
the dir.c problem.
