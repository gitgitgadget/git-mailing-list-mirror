You can get the uncompressed and on-disk sizes with:

  git cat-file --batch-all-objects \
    --batch-check='%(objectname) %(objectsize) %(objectsize:disk)'

and then compare the sizes/ratios however you like. If you want just a
subset of the blobs, drop the "--batch-all-objects" and just feed the
object names or even "HEAD:filename" on stdin).

I don't know of a tool that does that, but I think a modest application
of perl to the cat-file output would produce it.
