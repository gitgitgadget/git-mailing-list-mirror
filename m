If I remember correctly that is what I did when "master" (and I had switch
to master to do "git pull origin") didn't contain gitweb.cgi -> gitweb.perl
rename. My proposed solution first overwrites generated gitweb.cgi by
tracked file (i'm not sure if this is feature or bug that git-checkout
with file specified (path limit specified?) doesn't need -f, and then
you can do git-checkout full branch without -f.
