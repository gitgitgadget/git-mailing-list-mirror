Ok. There are now the following topics together on the wiki:

 * Git GUI that even a designer could use (Git``Cheetah, AKA Tortoise``=
Git?)=20
(UI session?)
 * Git integration with IDE, RAD, and editors (UI session?)
 * New Git Homepage hammering-out (UI session?)

The second one is new. And "(UI session?)" was added at the end of each=
 of=20
them.

The following topics are now together on the wiki:

 * Linkable library for basic object access (libification or new librar=
y)=20
 * Scriptability, using git in other languages (using interfaces vs cal=
ling=20
plumbing vs reimplementting)

The second one is new.

If we want these topics to be discussed during the GitTogether, we need=
=20
someone who wants to talk about or at least introduce these subjects=20
though. (Hint, hint.)

Thanks,
Christian.
