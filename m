I agree that this is not a good direction to go. I created the patch
because I was curious how difficult it would be, and it is good to have
a record of the possible direction. However, it complicates the file
format and will have unpredictable effects on the entropy (or on the
performance of history for case-colliding paths).

It is good that we have the capability to extend the filter data in
the future if we really need to.

I'll make a TODO item for myself to try writing that detailed Bloom
filter format documentation as a follow-up. In the meantime, I'll try
to close this out by responding to the feedback we have so far.

Thanks,
