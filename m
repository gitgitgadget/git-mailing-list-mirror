I think the best examples we have to show are

- Sverre (even if his work is not in git.git; Junio thought that the 
  project could gain more visibility outside of Git, but that had rather 
  the opposite effect), who interacted with the Git community and with his 
  mentor rather well,

- Marek, who did a good job with the push support in JGit/EGit (even if he 
  did not communicate with the community frequently, he did often enough, 
  and listened to advice), and of course

- Miklos, who was already known on the Git mailing list before getting 
  really involved through the Summer of Code.

Ciao,
Dscho
