At first I wasn't sure if it would ever make sense to use "-1" here. The
"punt" that happens in earlier calls to commit_pager_choice() is there
because we might adjust our decision later. And this would generally be
the final decision, I would think. So I'd be surprised if we had
anything besides "0" or "1" in the "def" argument.

But thinking on it, the most plausible case is something like:

  setup_auto_pager("foo", -1);
  ...
  /* fallback to some historical compatibility name */
  setup_auto_pager("bar", 0);

And it's important for the "-1" there to be a true punt, and not do
anything in commit_pager_choice(). So it's probably worth documenting
the "-1" behavior as you did here as a possible value for "def".
