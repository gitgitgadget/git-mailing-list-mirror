I deal with stupid user tricks on a daily basis. Most people that I've
met that aren't very computer savvy (including a number of web
programmers) would interpret what he wrote to mean "I'm not going to use
the command-line tools, so I can delete them and free up space on my
disk" (despite the fact that I'm pretty sure all of us actually agree
that's not what he intended). Sating that "Gitbox requires the Git
command-line tools and other binaries," and that "I have included
version xxx with Gitbox for your convenience, but you may use any newer
compatible version as well," would be far more clear. (The key word is
"requires.") You'd be surprised (or, well, probably not in your personal
case) how many programmers would benefit from it being stated that
clearly.

I'm pretty sure that's what's going on as well. We've been copying him
this whole time so if he feels the need to speak up he can do so.
