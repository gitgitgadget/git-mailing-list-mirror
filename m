Dear Mr. or Ms.

Our records show that we haven’t yet received payment of $7,980 for Invoice #2334889, which is overdue by one week.
I would appreciate if you could check this out on your end.

If the payment has already been sent, please disregard this notice. And if you’ve lost this invoice, please let me know, and I’d be happy to send you another copy.
