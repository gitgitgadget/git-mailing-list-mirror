Hi Jose,
In my $DAYJOB, I do a lot of process and requirements work often involv=
ing git - so I'm more of an advocate than a representative. Although I =
cannot speak on behalf of the community as a whole, I would be happy to=
 have a preliminary discussion with you on the type of guidance you mig=
ht need. Please reply privately with contact info and I will try to hel=
p.
Regards,
Randall
