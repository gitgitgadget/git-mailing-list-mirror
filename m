I thought that at first, too, but I think we'd still scale with the
number of shown lines. We're talking about short-circuiting OR, so by
definition we stop the short-circuit because we matched the first half
of the OR.

If you stop short-circuiting AND, then yes, you incur a penalty for
every line. But I don't think --column would need to do that.

Although there are interesting cases around inversion. For example:

  git grep --not \( --not -e a --and --not -e b \)

is equivalent to:

  git grep -e a --or -e b

Do people care if we actually hunt down the exact column where we
_didn't_ match "b" in the first case?  The two are equivalent, but I
have to wonder if somebody writing the first one really cares.

I don't see it as a random result; short-circuiting logic is well
understood and we follow the user's ordering.

I think the place where it's _most_ ugly is "--column --color", where we
may color the short-circuited value in the second pass.

Yes, we actually discussed this kind of transformation. I think it's way
out of scope for this patch series, though. If we do anything more, I
think it should be to disable short-circuiting when --column is in use.
