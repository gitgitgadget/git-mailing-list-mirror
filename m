There used to be a problem (many years ago), so let's see...

You mean, "format fl[ao]wed" is not used when posting via NNTP? That
still wouldn't help with reply all.

I know, but that changes config (esp. wrap+flowed) for all e-mails. I
would be nice if using an external editor would turn off TB's mangling.

I know why we do that, but attachments are there for a reason (stable
transport), and sending attached patches would be much easier for many
MUAs. It just shows that for nowadays usage of e-mail (not withstanding
Junio's historic remarks), using in-line text as a stable transport is
really "very special", to put it mildly.

I'll definitely try, thanks.
