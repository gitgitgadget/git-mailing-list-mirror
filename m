Hi, thanks for your interest.  I don't know when it was you checked - it 
may have been during a brief network outage our admins needed to do 
(unfortunately utsl.gen.nz is on a grace-and-favour service arrangement 
with its hosts, Catalyst), but the gitweb 
(http://utsl.gen.nz/gitweb/?p=VCS-Git-Torrent) is currently running, and 
I hope you can see the current activity.

I announced before that I would be sending an update shortly after the 
mid-term deadline, and I still plan on doing this.  Please be patient 
and wait until that happens in a week or so.

Cheers,
Sam.
