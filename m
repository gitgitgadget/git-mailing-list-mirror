This makes a lot of sense to me. The "get path that is ready from filter" should
block until the filter has data that it is ready to send. This way Git isn't
wasting time in a busy-loop asking whether the filter has data ready to be sent.
It also means that if the filter has one large chunk that it's ready to write,
Git can work on that while the filter continues to process more data,
theoretically improving the performance of checkouts with many large delayed
objects.

In addition to the above, I'd also like to investigate adding a "no more items"
message into the filter protocol. This would be useful for filters that
batch delayed items into groups. In particular, if the batch size is `N`, and Git
sends `2N-1` items, the second batch will be under-filled. The filter on the
other end needs some mechanism to send the second batch, even though it hasn't
hit max capacity.

Specifically, this is how Git LFS implements object transfers for data it does
not have locally, but I'm sure that this sort of functionality would be useful
for other filter implementations as well.
