Thanks, this patch looks good to me.

I don't have an opinion on the "-1 / +1" thing mentioned elsewhere. What
I care much more about is that the comment explains what is going on,
and what you wrote here is easy to understand.

I think this hunk is worth doing. As Ã†var noted, we do sometimes have
pretty big stack variables elsewhere, so we might have been able to get
away with it here.  But running out of stack can be unpredictable and
annoying. Given how easy and low-cost it is to put it on the heap here,
I'm glad to just do it preemptively.

There's a "fail:" label just below here. But since it does not return,
and just calls die(), then I agree you don't need to worry about freeing
in that case (and there are no other returns from the function). So this
single free is sufficient.
