I'm still somewhat confused about how this breaks. If we move
".git/config" out of the way, then we have no version indicator and
presumably we should guess GIT_HASH_SHA1. Which is what's happening if
we fail to call repo_set_hash_algo(), no?  In other words, wouldn't
repo_set_hash_algo() always be a noop in that case?

I get why adding the code snippet above would cause that assumption to
break, but I am just not sure why we would add that code snippet. ;)

I also get why read_repository_format() doing this in patch 3 would be a
problem:

  +       if (format->version == -1) {
  +               clear_repository_format(format);
  +               format->version = -1;
  +       }

but doesn't that point out that clear_repository_format() should be
setting hash_algo to GIT_HASH_SHA1 as the default (and likewise "bare =
-1", etc, that is done in that function)?
