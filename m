Dear diary, on Wed, May 03, 2006 at 10:39:07AM CEST, I got a letter
where Paolo Ciarrocchi <paolo.ciarrocchi@gmail.com> said that...

I think this has time and someone might emerge naturally.

You can already find a similar (albeit a bit more low-level) document at

	http://kernel.org/git/?p=git/git.git;a=blob;hb=todo;f=TODO

but you can certainly add a link to it to the wiki. ;-)

I think it's explained somewhere in their forums (or mailing lists or
whatever they actually _are_).
