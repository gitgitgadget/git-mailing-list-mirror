Thanks. This definitely seems like an improvement. I verified that it
works in practice, and the patch itself looks obviously correct.

One of the things I had to double check is how to_skip is handled, since
we check it in the moved block. It's fine, but I wondered if the whole
thing would be easier as an if/else cascade with an early return. Like
the patch below (on top of your patch; try "diff -w" to quiet the
indentation noise).

But maybe it's not worth the churn (and if we pursue it at all, it
should not hold up your patch).
