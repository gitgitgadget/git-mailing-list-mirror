Subject: [PATCH] RelNotes/2.23.0: fix a few typos and other minor issues

Fix the spelling of the new "--no-show-forced-updates" option that "git
fetch/pull" learned. Similarly, spell "--function-context" correctly and
fix a few typos, grammos and minor mistakes.

One of these is also in 2.22.1.txt, so fix it there too.
