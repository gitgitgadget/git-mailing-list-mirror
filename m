Oh, you know, possibilities like:

- I'm sick of being googled and quizzed about every off-the-cuff
  remark I've ever made.
- My real name is not pronouncable by earthlings.
- My embittered ex joe-jobs me with porn spam whenever he finds a new
  e-mail address for me.
- My day job has licensed BitKeeper and I don't want hassles from
  His Larryness.
- I'm am illegal immigrant and I don't want to get noticed by la Migra.
- My name is Jamal Al-Gashey and it's *so* not worth it.

And I'm never sure if it's politer to use an obvious pseudonym or a
subtle one.
