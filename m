OK, that makes more sense: it's an input format error, because we only
take hex oids.

Do you care about complaining about:

  git rev-parse HEAD^{tree} | git commit-graph write --stdin-commits

? That's the case that's much more interesting, I think.

Right. I think there are two orthogonal questions:

  - whether to resolve arbitrary names to objects and how to handle such
    input if we don't

  - what to do with an oid (whether given as hex or resolved from a
    name) that isn't a commit-ish
