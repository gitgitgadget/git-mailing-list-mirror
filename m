Right.

Because mailsplit can read from a file, too.

I left it at that, because it is a rare case, the buffer has to be 
accessed with the trailing NUL anyway, and I think it is worth to have 
this function quite readable.  I, for one, am pretty certain that I 
understand what this function does, and how, in 6 months from now, without 
any additional documentation.

... except this is unreadable at best ;-)

Again, I think this is too cuddled.  You have to think about every second 
line, and that makes for stupid mistakes with this developer.
