I suspect it's just code in need of a cleanup. But let's cc the original
author of 1e16b255b (git-imap-send: use libcurl for implementation,
2014-11-09) to see if he has any comments[1].

[1] Bernhard, the whole series is at:

      https://public-inbox.org/git/38d3ae5b-4020-63cc-edfa-0a77e42798b8@morey-chaisemartin.com/

    The general idea is to make sure the original and curl imap-send
    implementations have feature parity, make the curl version the
    default, and then hopefully eventually drop the non-curl one
    entirely.
