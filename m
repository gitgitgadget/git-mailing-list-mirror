In my scenario I am tracking various upstream repositories, none of
which I have push permission for. This means I have set up a
`remote.pushDefault` [1] to the remote "my", which is mapped to my
GitHub repo where I can publish work (i.e. push).Â 

So when I push, I am pushing to "my" remote, but when rebasing, the
upstream is not that destination, and in a collaboration environment,
may not even be the place I first forked from (e.g. the distinction
between 'git.git' [git], 'git-for-windows.git' [gfw], and Junio's repo
[gitster], all with the same root). I can then either send PRs (if
acceptable) or send patches (cover letter link to my publish repo).

In the case where a user has set their remote.pushDefault, then it's not
clear that there should be a default at all, though I maybe
misunderstanding the approach here.
