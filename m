So this text is really dramatic and implies (to me, at least), that
parallelized coverage builds just don't work.  I've just run a
coverage build with this patch and my usual GIT_PROVE_OPTS containing
'-j4', and the tests went well and the generated report looks good,
too (I don't know how it's supposed to look, but at least I didn't
notice anything obviously wrong with it).  However, this might mean
nothing, because further digging turned up the follow paragraph in
901c369af5 (Support coverage testing with GCC/gcov, 2009-02-19):

    The tests are run serially (with -j1).  The coverage code should
    theoretically allow concurrent access to its data files, but the
    author saw random test failures.  Obviously this could be
    improved.

And in the related email discussion [1]:

  But even though the docs claim it [-j<N>] should be possible,
  I've been getting "random" test failures when compiled with coverage
  support, that went away with -j1.  So the tests still run with -j1, as
  with the first version of the series.

So it doesn't seem to be that bad after all, because it's not
"completely breaks" but "random test failures".  Still far from ideal,
but the original coverage patch is just about 3 weeks short of a
decade old, so maybe things have improved since then, and it'd be
worth a try to leave GIT_PROVE_OPTS as is and see what happens.
