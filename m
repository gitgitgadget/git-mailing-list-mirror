Do you have the script you used for this? It would be very interesting
as something we could stick in t/perf/ to test this use-case in the
future.

How does this & the numbers below compare to just a na√Øve
--max-pack-size=<similar size> on linux.git?

Is it possible for you to tar this test repo up and share it as a
one-off? I've been polishing the core.validateAbbrev series I have, and
it would be interesting to compare some of the (abbrev) numbers.
