Yes, that's the problem: it shows "started from branch", not "On
branch".  Conceptually a huge difference.

I do focus on the most common case: I'm on branch 'foo' built on top
of current master, when a bugreport comes in, and I start bisecting on
the range v2.12.0..v2.16.0.  It can not possibly be considered that
during the bisect I'm on the branch 'foo' during the bisection, they
are totally unrelated.
