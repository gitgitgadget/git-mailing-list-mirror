But that was my (and GÃ¡bor's) point: it is not future proof, because we
don't know whether it is a sufficient test until we actually see a
version of JGit with the correct support.

Not only that, but your proposed solution relies on having commits in
the repository, which is not something that a prereq should be relying
on.

We may or may not need the version check eventually, but my point is
that we should be punting on it until we know what is needed.
