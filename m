Hi,

I installed git for windows 2.14.2 (64bit) and was trying to clone a 
repository from a command terminal (cmd.exe):

git clone https://Netzeband@bitbucket.org/Netzeband/deep-speeddreams.git

First everything went well, but after the repository was downloaded the 
LFS download started. At this point the terminal window just closed and 
I was not able to see anything related on the terminal. There was no 
error message.
However several git processes (and git lfs) were running in the 
background and downloaded everything for the repository (all lfs files).

The same happens if I use the git-bash.

After switching back to 2.13.0 with the same settings during 
installation, this error did not occur again.

I'm using Windows 10 (b4 bit) which all current updates installed.

Best regards,
Andr√©
