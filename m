Thanks!

Ok, i did not actually check coding style yet. I could run it through a
tool, given there is a suggestion. Or i could address issues someone
points out in the review.
What i get from your comment is that it might be ok to leave the code
as is, others have introduces similar constructs before me.

Yes that is code that can not (should not) be reached. I agree that an
assert(0) is not very expressive and will fix that in v2.

I will pull the tests from patch 5 before touching that code and fix up
issues inbetween. The whole series saw a "make test" inbetween all
commits.

True, the two are almost the same and should be merged. Will do in v2.
