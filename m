This (and the patch) seems quite reasonable as a fix.

I actually think we could go further and drop the cd_to_toplevel
entirely. IIRC, the only thing it accomplishes[1] is that we can
consistently refer to the tmp directory as Documentation/tmp-doc-diff.

It would probably be fine to:

  - use "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/Documentation/tmp-doc-diff".
    In earlier iterations of the script, I think using an absolute path
    bled through to the resulting diff, but we later cleaned that up
    anyway.

  - just use a relative "tmp-doc-diff". I doubt anybody actually wants
    to do anything other than "cd Documentation && ./doc-diff" anyway.
    This breaks "./Documentation/doc-diff", but it is not like you can
    run "t/t0000-basic.sh" either.

[1] I think also in early iterations I had some notion of using the cwd
    to build things, but that quickly went out the window in favor of
    worktrees.
