Actually, there is one thing we should do. :)

Our ideas page is missing potential mentors for many of the projects.
This is useful information for coordinating GSoC, but I think is doubly
important for Outreachy, where applicants are encouraged to get in touch
with mentors early.

So would people who have proposed ideas mind going over the page at

  http://git.github.io/SoC-2016-Ideas/

and making sure they are listed under their projects? And likewise, can
people make sure they are listed with their preferred email addresses? I
do think we generally expect people to communicate on the list, but it
should be as easy as possible for them to cc the mentors.

If you have fixes to make, please feel free to push straight to "master"
of that repository (if you have access), or open a pull request or send
me a patch if you don't.
