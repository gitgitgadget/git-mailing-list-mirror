Well, but your argument above also applies here - gitweb does not allow
users to modify README.html or desrciption either. Who knows where ctags
may come from, they might even be autogenerated based on something.
I admit that the code could be a bit more resilient to invalid contents
of the files, but I do not see that as a major problem either (it is
possible to confuse gitweb by putting invalid stuff into other
repository files too).
