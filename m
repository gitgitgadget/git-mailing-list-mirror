Another one that a colleague of mine hit is:

	git checkout -b branch-without-file branch-with-file
	git rm some-file
	# Allow for some external changes on branch-with-file
	git pull . branch-with-file

One possibility for fixing this case is to make git-rm delete the file
by default, (that is, act as if the current -f option is
passed). There's no real safety concern unless the file is dirty,
(could require -f again for that case).

Fixing the behavior instead of adding configuration is definitely a
good plan.
