That's just another bug in gmail.

We did not even find a way to post patches via gmail's web interface, not 
without severely damaging the patches.  So I guess no, most of us avoid 
the web interface (unless absolutely necessary, in which case we resort to 
the less than brilliant solution to attach the patches).

I, for one, am totally opposed to this split.  All too often valuable 
_user_ discussions turn into _technical_ discussions, and thence into a 
throwing back and forth patches.

Ciao,
