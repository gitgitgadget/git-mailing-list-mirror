Other version control systems:
I think the list needs to be sorted alphabetically, it's really long.
(You could also reduce and offer a text field "other.)

Resources:
I wouldn't put git-scm.com and the pro-git book into the same item.
git-scm.com was supposed to be "the" git community website (and also
"the" reference on git), and the fact that it looks like a pro-git book
sales platform is a different matter.

An interesting question would be: "What is the first source you conside=
r
Git?", or even: "What is the Git homepage?"... Really, getting input on
what "the Git homepage" should be like would be nice, but not comparabl=
e
to previous surveys.

In any case, thanks for taking care of the survey again!

Michael
