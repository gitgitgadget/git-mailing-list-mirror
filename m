I'm not GÃ¡bor, but that is the sequence I think is best.

Between the die() and the ERR, the ERR packets are way more useful in
practice, since they actually go back to the client. I'd even suggest we
do away with the die() messages entirely (since they're either redundant
or go nowhere, depending on the protocol), but I think it would make
sense to wait until the raciness issues are fixed (until then, they
_might_ help in the redundant cases, which is what the test here is
relying on).
