To give them an idea about their _rights_.  Because they are entitled by 
the GPL to get -- in source -- the changes that were done to that 
particular distributions.

Speaking from experience, companies usually do not want to tell you about 
your rights with regard to free software.

And in this case, I have a personal interest.  I feel that my efforts to 
the msysGit project are not really rewarded.  People like to use it, but 
they hardly give anything back (you being a very notable exception).

Ciao,
Dscho
