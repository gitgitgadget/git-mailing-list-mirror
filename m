  ...please scratch the Git Wiki part, you would be supporting just
repo.or.cz - we are considering to move the Git wiki to wiki.kernel.org
MediaWiki installation and I would like to ask if anyone disagrees with
this. The motivation is that:

	(i) wiki.kernel.org is actually maintained! Thus, there should
	be less spam or upgrade issues and better support in case of
	problems.

	(ii) Also, I personally think MediaWiki is so much nicer than
	ikiwiki...

	(iii) ...and OBTW, no CamelCase!

  Of course, there will be compatibility redirects.


  P.S.: Sorry for such hasty mail, I just want to avoid extracting money
from someone on false pretenses. ;-) Let me know if you already sent
some money and wished to support just the wiki.
