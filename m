I've been speaking enough on oss conferences this year and feel I don't
have time to spend on making slides and preparing for another conferenc=
e,
but I'd love to attend and can almost certainly help out on the worksho=
p
if needed.

it

need from a git library so I can properly prioritize the different todo=
s
for libgit2.
