Dear diary, on Fri, Jul 15, 2005 at 02:46:42AM CEST, I got a letter
where Fredrik Kuivinen <freku045@student.liu.se> told me that...
> Hi,

Hello from a lazy reader who didn't actually try it,

> Git Commit Tool or gct is a simple GUI enabled Git commit tool. It

do you have any screenshots please? From the description it appears it
is actually not any more powerful than cg-commit. Does it let you see
the diff, actually prune the changes to be committed and such?
