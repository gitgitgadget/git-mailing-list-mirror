Thanks! No rush, as we are not even accepted yet, but you can create a
profile at:

  http://google-melange.com

and ask to join the "git" project as a mentor.

You may also want to add Windows-specific ideas to the page at:

  https://github.com/git/git.github.io/blob/master/SoC-2015-Ideas.md

Even something high-level like "helping move programs to builtins to
help Windows" will let students know that it's a potential direction.
