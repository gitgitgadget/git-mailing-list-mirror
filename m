Interesting.  I just tried it on my POSIX testsuite and unfortunately
it failed a number of simple tests including the case statement and
segfaulted on quite a few occasions too.  I've included one of the
segfault scripts here.

Dash is already used in busybox where it has been linked with ulibc.
So it can't be that hard to make it work with klibc.

Perhaps you could use dash for your project as well?

Cheers,
