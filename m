This is one of those cases in which "cd full" while in subshell,
rather than using "-C full" repeatedly, would perhaps make the code a
bit less noisy, but it is, of course, subjective and what you have
here is good enough.

This works because an earlier test created "new-idx", and it created
it directly in the trash-directory rather than in the "full"
subdirectory where it used to reside before this patch. Okay.

Prior to this patch, "commit-graph-backup" was placed in the "full"
subdirectory and test_when_finished() removed it from that location.
As of this patch, "commit-graph-backup" is placed in the top-level
trash-directory and cleaned up from there. Okay.
