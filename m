Thanks for the review and suggestions for additional changes. See a

Good idea, though this could just go atop this series.

I intentionally left HEAD as-is because it consistently lacks quotes
in this document, and I didn't feel strongly about it being quoted or
not. Such a change could easily go atop this series.

I did see and consider adding backticks around "index" here but
likewise didn't feel strongly about it at the time. But upon
reconsideration, as a literal filename, you're right that it ought to
be typeset specially.

I missed this one.

And this.

Ditto.

In addition to the grammo you spotted, the quotes around
worktreeConfig should be backticks.

I'll think go ahead and re-roll, adding a couple new patches,
respectively, for the linkgit:'s you pointed out and typesetting
`HEAD` specially.
