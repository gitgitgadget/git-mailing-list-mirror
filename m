I think you have "is was" here.  You probably want one or the other.

I generally write my name in lower case, but I think typically we prefer
to omit Cc lines in patches (unlike LKML), so it may just be better to
remove these lines.

Patch 1 looked good to me.  Your explanation here makes sense, but I
must admit that I still don't understand this code, so I can't give an
outright approval.  I do appreciate that it comes with a test, though.

I haven't tested, but I expect this series will make Dscho's patch
unnecessary, so I'll drop it in my reroll unless one of you tells me to
keep it.
