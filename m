Thanks for the patch. I think this is going in the right direction, but
I have a few minor comments.

These headers are redundant with what's in your email headers and can be
dropped.

This is definitely an improvement, though I wonder if we should mention
that we default to core.abbrev (which in turn defaults to the "auto"
behavior).

It looks like there are a few other mentions of "7" with respect to
"--abbrev": git-branch.txt, git-describe.txt, git-blame.txt. Those
should probably get the same treatment.

There are a few other "--abbrev" options (e.g., ls-files and ls-tree)
that don't mention "7". But while we're fixing the others, it may be
worth giving them all consistent text.
