Sounds good. It looks like you might have had some further thoughts a
little bit lower down in the thread, so I'll respond to those shortly
just to make sure that I didn't miss anything before readying a 'v3' for
submission.

Yeah, I agree that the use of "allow" is a little funny for these
reasons. That said, I don't think that it's in dire need of changing,
and so since we agree that it's outside the scope of this series, I'm
happy to ignore it for now.
