As a human user, I would very much like to see this feature :) It helps 
much to visually distinct things, but `git diff` sits way to deep in my 
muscle memory to remember my alias. Also, we have a configuration system 
to set configuration options for many things.

I wonder though, how many other configuration options we already have, 
that potentially break 'random scripts' because the user has set it ...
