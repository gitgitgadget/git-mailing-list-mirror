This version looks to be in really good shape, for the most part. I feel
the need to point out that this is a very mature submission, and it covers
many of the bases we expect from a quality series, even at only the second
version.

My comments deal with some high-level "patch series strategy" considerations,
mostly. There are a few concerns about correctness in the complicated cases
of mixed commit-graphs with or without the GDAT chunk, and how we could
perhaps test those cases. The best way would be to update the 'verify'
subcommand to check the GDAT chunk. That's a good feature to have, but would
be unnecessary bloat to this series. Depending on timing, we might want to
hold this series in 'next' until such an implementation is submitted. (I
expect that Abhishek's GSoC internship would be over at that point, so I
volunteer to send those patches after this series stabilizes.)

Thank you for your careful work on such a complicated subject!

Thanks,
-Stolee
