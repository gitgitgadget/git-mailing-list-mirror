I know this suggestion comes a bit late but would it make sense to let
the repository owner overwrite the core.abbrev setting?

One possible way to implement this would be adding .gitconfig support to
repositories with a very limited set of whitelisted variables allowed in
there (could be core.abbrev only to begin with). Or some entirely
separate mechanism like .gitignore.

With such a mechanism, we could keep the default of 7 which works fine
for most projects. Linus could bump the default to 12 for linux.git. If
some users are not happy with that, they can still overwrite it in their
local Git config. Anybody starting a project could change the initial
value to a suitable value in one of the first commits -- provided they
already have an idea how much the project will grow. That way, hashes
will be "long enough" even for early commits, before any heuristics
could guess that the project would become large.

Opinions?

Regards,
Lukas
