Actually, the docs are quite confusing. The LSan "exitcode" option
defaults to 23, and that is the exit code you get. So I think it
probably is interpreted as the code to exit with, or 0 for "use the
original exit code".

For hunting a particular trace, I think you have to walk up the list of
called functions and see where the pointers go out of scope. I'm not
sure how to make that easier (in theory a compiler-instrumentation like
LSan could do it by performing a leak-check when pointers go out of
scope. But it would also need to know about copies you've made of
pointers, so I imagine it would be extremely slow to run).

But at least on the topic of "how many unique leaks are there", I wrote
the script below to try to give some basic answers. It just finds the
first non-boring entry in each stack trace and reports that. Where
"boring" is really "this function is not expected to free, but hands off
memory ownership to somebody else".

You can use it to do:

  perl leaks.pl /tmp/lsan/output.* | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head

to see places that leak a lot. These are either boring calls that need
to be annotated, or are high-value targets for de-leaking.

I notice ref-filter.c has quite a few high entries on the list. I'm not
sure yet which case it falls into. :)

The other interesting thing is seeing how many "unique" leaks there are:

  perl leaks.pl /tmp/lsan/output.* | sort -u | wc -l

I get a bit over 800 with a run of the test suite. Which is a lot, but
fewer than I expected. And I'm sure quite a few of them are really
"duplicates" that can be eliminated in chunks.

So I don't know how useful any of that will be, but it at least should
give _some_ metric that should be diminishing as we fix leaks.
