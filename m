Here are the two topics I plan on bringing:

  - Git / Software Freedom Conservancy yearly report. I'll plan to give
    a rundown of the past year's activities and financials, along with
    some open questions that could benefit from community input.

  - The git-scm.com website: who runs that thing, anyway? An overview
    of the site, how it's managed, and what it needs.

I plan to send out detailed emails on both topics to the list on
Wednesday, and then follow-up with a summary of any useful in-person
discussion (since obviously not everybody will be at the summit).

I'd encourage anybody with a topic to present to consider doing
something similar.
