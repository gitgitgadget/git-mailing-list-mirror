I think it would be a good idea to send it on the list once before we go 
ahead with it.  This way other people who are interested can take a 
look.  They might not necessarily pay enough attention to the threads to 
notice the GitHub link.  And there is, as you mentioned, the added 
benefit of having it on the mailing list archives.
