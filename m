Hi all

It's pretty clear that code stored in a Git repository isn't considered a derived work of Git, regardless of whether it is used in a commercial context or otherwise.

However, I'm unable to find this stated in any authoritative and unambiguous manner.

For example, http://www.sitepoint.com/public-license-explained/ has a pretty nasty disclaimer at the end.

Would it be possible to make an unambiguous, authoritative statement on your website, or something like that, that would make commercial adoption more appealing?

Thank you!

Jonathan
