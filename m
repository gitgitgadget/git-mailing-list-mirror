Thanks.

I had a moment of panic over my week off that the new code wasn't using
the right hash for non-SHA-1 repositories. But we check that the hash
version the file was written with matches 'the_hash_algo' at runtime,
and we use 'the_hash_algo->rawsz' to determine the end of the contents,
so we're all good here.

I would definitely appreciate some more comments, but I have only
sporadically been keeping up-to-date with this series. Ã†var sent some
suggestions which I've been replying to today as I catch back up, but
they appear mostly cosmetic (at least, the ones that I've read so far).

I think at this point I'd want a deep review from somebody familiar with
bitmaps before re-rolling. Peff and I have both looked over the series
exhaustively within GitHub, but the clean version submitted here should
definitely be checked before merging.

I'm not in a big hurry to merge this, but there are some other good
topics that are built on top (and it makes working on other bitmap
related things kind of a pain since there are two choices for what to
base it on).

Thanks,
Taylor
