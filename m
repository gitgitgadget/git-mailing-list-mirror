Can you add this to Documentation/Makefile as well, so that an HTML
version will appear once this is merged?  See
https://public-inbox.org/git/20180814222846.GG142615@aiede.svl.corp.google.com/
for an example.

I like the idea of more structured logs for tracing, monitoring, and
diagnosis (see also
https://research.google.com/archive/papers/dapper-2010-1.pdf on the
subject of tracing).  My main focus in looking over this initial
contribution is

 1. Is this something that could eventually merge with our other
    tracing APIs (e.g. trace_printf), or will they remain separate?

 2. Is the API introduced here one that will be easy to work with
    and adapt?  What will calling code that makes use of it look like?

I'm not sure what to make of this section.  Is it a historical
artifact, or should I consider it part of the design?

Thanks for the example!  I'd also be interested in what the tracing
code looks like, since the API is the 'deepest' change involved (the
tracing format can easily change later based on experience).

My initial reaction to the example trace is that it feels like an odd
compromise: on one hand it uses text (JSON) to be human-readable, and
on the other hand it is structured to be machine-readable.  The JSON
writer isn't using a standard JSON serialization library so parsing
difficulties seem likely, and the output is noisy enough that reading
it by hand is hard, too.  That leads me to wish for a different
format, like protobuf (where the binary form is very concise and
parseable, and the textual form is IMHO more readable than JSON).

All that said, this is just the first tracing output format and it's
easy to make new ones later.  It seems fine for that purpose.

Does it write with O_APPEND?  Does it do anything to guard against
interleaved events --- e.g. are messages buffered and then written
with a single write() call?

The natural question would be in the opposite direction: can and
should trace_printf be reimplemented on top of this feature?

nit: trailing whitespace (you can find these with "git show --check").

I wonder if we can structure events in a more hierarchical way to
avoid having to special-case the toplevel command in this way.

Especially for tracing and monitoring applications, it would be
helpful if more of the information were emitted earlier instead of
waiting for exit.  Especially if I am trying to trace the cause of a
hanging command, information that is only printed at exit does not
help me.

The main missing bit in this doc is a sketch of the API.  Looking
forward to finding that in the header. ;-)

Sorry for the slow review, and thanks for your thoughtful work.

Sincerely,
Jonathan
