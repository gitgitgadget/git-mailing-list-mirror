Thanks for your attention here. I've been thinking a lot about this 
heuristic and have concluded the following two things are true:

(1) When we return 1, the order that we explore the 'from' commits does 
not change the explored set of commits.

(2) When we return 0, the order that we explore the 'to' commits will 
change the explored set, but it is difficult to say that the heuristic 
helps more than it hurts.

Item (1) is contrary to what I had thought when I first created the 
heuristic.

The details are tricky, but essentially each DFS starting at a 'from' 
commit may be short-circuited due to a prior walk, but swapping the 
order of those two 'from' commits would lead to the same set of commits 
to be explored (with the short-circuit happening in the other commit). 
The only change is that we can terminate early if we fully explore a 
'from' commit and do not find a commit marked with 'with_flag'. In this 
sense, it would be best to explore the commits that are "closest" to the 
generation number cutoff first, as we can maybe find a negative answer 
earlier in the search.

In this sense, we could remove the sort entirely and probably not have 
much performance hit. But since the set of 'from' commits is probably 
much smaller than the set of commits to explore, the sort is likely 
inexpensive.

In conclusion: I cannot say that this sort is super-important. As for 
the potential benefits in (2), I'll leave that to people who run git as 
a server who may have telemetry around fetch negotiation. How often do 
we actually say we need more rounds of negotiation? What kinds of data 
shapes matter there?

Thanks,
-Stolee
