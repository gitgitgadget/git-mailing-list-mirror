But @Vimal Thiagaraj has confirmed that the repositories size limit depend upon the remote TFS databases and not the server itself. Is there a limit on these databases or on how much changes can a git commit contain?

Can you confirm the operating system versions and Git versions for the 
machine doing the push and the server attempting the receiving? 
Especially are either of them Windows systems which currently have a 
32bit size limit (which is sizeof(long)..).

I have a patch series in review on the Git-for-Windows Github repo 
(#2179) that should allow objects and packs greater than 4Gb. However..

This may still be a limit on the 'transfer' process (100Gb could take a 
long time, have time outs, break internal virus checkers that monitor 
the feed, etc).
