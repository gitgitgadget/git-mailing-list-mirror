That makes sense, I guess. In the CI system I'm using there's no such
distinction, and I just do:

    tar -x && make -j64 test && exit 0
    echo "Failing tests:"
    echo "--------------"
    grep -l '[^0]' t/test-results/*.exit |
    while read failed; do
      base=${failed%.exit}
      name=${base#t/test-results/}
      echo "==> $name"
      cat "$base.out"
    done
    exit 1

There's no folds there at all, but we could of course do our own. It may
not be worth messing with, though, if you've shaken all the problems out
of the existing setup.

I'm surprised we get that much benefit out of a 3-way parallel run, but
I'll believe you if you measured it. I guess it's because a lot of the
really long tests are right at the end, numerically (especially if svn
tests are enabled). I wonder if "--shuffle" would yield similar
benefits.
