I agree that 162 is wrong. Its interpretation is 128+signal, which clearly does not happen in this case. On the platform, if the perl script is via stdin, 162 or 169 are returned. If via file (perl file.pl), 255 comes back. The port has issues. I have an opened a bug report with the platform developers. Usual non-Open Source timeframes to fix apply. â˜¹

Choosing 1 is an option. I can try that, but I'm not sure it's going to help the test situation more than choosing 255 to replace 162.
