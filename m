Part of this is due to outputting too many refs from for-each-ref, but
part of it is that for-each-ref is not good at limiting the refs it
looks at internally. I have a patch for that, but it's not all that
helpful without Michael Haggerty's mmap-packed-refs work, so I'll get it
included there.

So that makes this change doubly important. You get the immediate
speedups, and then you'll get another one when that work is merged
later.

Working on the aforementioned patch, I noticed that for-each-ref's
matching is a little tricky due to its path semantics. So I wanted to
double-check your patterns. :) I think these should do the right thing.
