Hallo,

I have accounts on dozens of wikis and i am an admin on a few of them.
I opened an account on https://git.wiki.kernel.org/ , created a user
page and put there a link to my blog. That's always the first thing i
do on wikis to which i plan to contribute, because that's the easiest
way to tell the world who i am before i start changing pages that
other people wrote. It's not so different from filling in the
"website" field on the profile page on GitHub, Twitter, LinkedIn or
any other website and it's pretty normative.

On the Git wiki, however, the user page i created was deleted for
"link spam" and my account was blocked for "Spamming links to external
sites". I asked on the deleting admin's user talk page what is wrong
about putting a link to my blog. The admin didn't reply, but deleted
my question with the comment "Inappropriate abuse of the Wiki as a
messenger, as well as abuse of the admin". On all the wikis i know the
whole point of user talk pages is sending messages between users and
with all seriousness i just can't understand how what i did
constitutes "abuse of the admin".

It is possible, of course, that this wiki has different rules. For
example, you may want nothing but technical pages and no personal
content whatsoever. Although it is quite contrary to the wiki idea, it
is legitimate, but you should at least write it somewhere. Wikis
usually have a "Help" or a "Community portal" page - i couldn't find
anything like that on yours. And if you don't want user and user talk
pages to exist, just don't allow people to edit them in the first
place.

I would be glad to have my account, Amire80, unblocked. I can open
another one, but i happen to like this user name.

Thank you,

--
