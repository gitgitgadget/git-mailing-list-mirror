Thanks for the review.  I'm not an English major so appreciate the 
feedback on my attempts to document the feature.

I understand the unintuitive comment but the other such options in the 
code base are just above the fsmonitor options as it is modeled on how 
'assume-unchanged' and 'skip-worktree' work.  Consistency is certainly 
helps the intuitiveness as once you have learned the model, it applies 
in other places.

For better and for worse, I choose to be consistent with how the options 
work (especially the untracked-cache option immediately above).  This is 
one weakness of reviewing patches via email - you don't see the patch in 
context with everything around it.

I'm going to sound like a broken record here. :) The description favored 
consistency with the untracked cache feature immediate above this entry. 
  It is literally a copy/paste/edit.

This is based on the assumption that the text had already been reviewed 
and found to be acceptable.  This also means if you have figured it out 
for one option, when you read the next, you're understanding can carry 
forward speeding up your comprehension.
