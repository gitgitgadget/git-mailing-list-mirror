The scenario I had in mind was three or more threads simultaneously
dying, each incrementing dying counter by one and before any of them
have a chance to say "called many times, error or racy threaded
death!", because they all observe three (or more).  

But I was incorrectly reading the code---in that case, as long as
dying is small enough, we'll return 0 and let at least one of the
caller give a chance to give a message that came in "err" from their
invocations of die()'s.

So I do not think it is worth worrying about too deeply.

Thanks.
