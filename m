How about using `MAKEFLAGS`? I ran a quick test:

	MAKEFLAGS='CC=blub' make -C .. git.o
	make: Entering directory '/usr/src/git/wip'
	    * new build flags
	    CC git.o
	/bin/sh: blub: command not found

In other words, you could add something like this to the ci/ script:

	MAKEFLAGS="${MAKEFLAGS:+$MAKEFLAGS }CC=$CC"
	export MAKEFLAGS

Ciao,
