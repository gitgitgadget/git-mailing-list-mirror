I'm not sure that's necessary; most of the traffic seems to come
from /git/MESSAGE_ID/ links posted by others.  So it's
probably more inside-out exposure than anything.

As for other projects, I'm not aware of anybody else using it,
yet.  I have some small projects using it, but most of those are
one-off throwaways and I'm not comfortable promoting those along
with public-inbox.  I admit: I'm not comfortable promoting
anything I do, really.

I do wish more people would start using the .onions, though...
