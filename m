I am very happy to be considered a key developer in your list, but it seems 
unfair for both Johannes Sixt and Simon Hausmann as they have a higher commit 
count than I have. So you should perhaps add them too. Or did you count lines 
of code?

About affiliations, I did practically all of my work on Git at home during my 
free time, so I have none. But I would happy to have one in the future, if 
some company would be willing to pay me for working on Git or Git related stuff 
(hint, hint! ;-)

Thanks,
Christian.
