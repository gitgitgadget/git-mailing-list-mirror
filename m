A few other hints on getting a good application:

What is expected here is a _convincing_ application, ie. have enough
arguments to convince the future mentor and the administrator of the
organization that if the project is accepted, then it will be a success.
Don't write your application as "I'd like to do this", but more as
"Here are proofs that if my application is accepted, then the project
will go smoothly".

There are two important points:

* Technical skills: a typical application shows that the applicant
  already looked at the code, understands the ins and outs: what code
  needs to be changed, how will it be tested, ...

* Interaction with the community: we like to discuss and iterate over
  our contributions. You (Elena) already saw this kind of discussion
  happen for your microproject, but we expect similar discussions for
  applications. For examples of such discussions, see:

    http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/289700/focus=289869
    http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/289299/focus=289407
    ...
    (this one is for GSoC, but it's very similar to Outreachy)
