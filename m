Thanks, this looks good to me. I fixed the system headers in xinclude.h,
but didn't think to check for individual C files including them.

I did a quick grep for similar cases, and didn't find any that I think
would be problematic. There were a few cleanups, below.

There are still some other system includes, but they are mostly one-offs
that we wouldn't expect git-compat-util to cover (e.g., threading stuff
in thread-utils.[ch], openssl stuff in hash.h). So I think with your
patch, plus the patches below, there's nothing left to clean up.

  [1/2]: verify-tag: drop signal.h include
  [2/2]: wt-status.h: drop stdio.h include
