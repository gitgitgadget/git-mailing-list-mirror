This is my understanding. We focus on the data we just wrote to see
if anything went wrong at a lower level (i.e. filesystem or RAM
corruption during the write process) instead of the data "at rest".

Right. And we want to keep the amount of work to be very small in most
cases, amortizing the cost of the big merge operations across many much
smaller runs. Perhaps a later change could introduce an option to drop
the '--shallow' option and check the entire chain, for users willing to
pay that price.

Back to the point of your comments: I'm not sure this second paragraph
is required at all in the documentation. The first paragraph already
says:

	...then verifies that the written data is correct.

This "written data" _is_ the top layer of the chain. There is probably
no reason to dig deeper into _why_ we do this in this user-facing
documentation.

So, I propose just deleting this paragraph. What do you think?

Thanks for keeping a close eye on documentation changes! I updated
my local branch to include the '+' problem from your other reply.

Thanks,
