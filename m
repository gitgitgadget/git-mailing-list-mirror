I actually think word choice and politeness is only a small part of it,
and one that I live without.  It is not just _how_ something is said,
but _what_ is said. And sometimes what is said does not lead in a
productive direction. I found Thomas's comment here:

  http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/227053

sums up the core of many of the conflicts I've seen on the list.

I am less interested in people's feelings than I am in discussions
trying to reach a productive position of agreement, rather than turning
it into a point by point debate that may no longer have any use for the
project (sometimes individual points need to be refuted or discussed, of
course, but it is easy to lose sight of the purpose of an email).
