Hi!

When running on Windows XP (no matter which language of the OS I had 
installed), git-gui and gitk (msys) would show up in the language I had set 
up as my primary language in the Control Panel (Swedish).

I am now running Git on the Windows 7 RC, and I cannot get it to work, I get 
English in all cases. I have set all locale settings in the Control Panel to 
Swedish, and even installed the Swedish Display Language Pack and set the OS 
language to Swedish.

Does anyone know if there is something else I need to do to get git-gui/gitk 
to display in Swedish?
