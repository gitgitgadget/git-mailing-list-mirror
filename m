Hi Sverre,

Sorry. I should have removed the statement about the mail being confidential. It's not confidential. It's definitely public!

You will need to register and create a Jazz.net account to be able to access the page. https://jazz.net/pub/user/register.jsp 
Note: I am not trying to promote RTC or Jazz in any way.

I posted this information to this list because there may be others with an interest in adding functionality this to RTC, in which case we may have some common ground. I am not sure that the Git development community would need to be involved in this at all. So you can treat it as being for information only, if you wish ...

Hope this explains it.

Regards

David

What does this mean? Is this something the git community can help with? I can't even access that page...

Why are you sending a Confidential email to a public list?
