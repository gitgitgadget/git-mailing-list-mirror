Thanks for splitting this out. The default setting is definitely
orthogonal to allowing the config.

I've been running with this default for several years now (using the
patch I showed in the earlier thread you linked). It _does_ occasionally
annoy me, but I think overall it's an improvement. So it seems like a
good thing to try, and we can see how people respond as they try it out.
