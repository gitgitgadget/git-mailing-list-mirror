During the initial stage of the struggle, the oppressed, instead of
striving for liberation, tend themselves to become oppressors The very
structure of their thought has been conditioned by the contradictions of
the concrete, existential situation by which they were shaped. Their
ideal is to be men; but for them, to be men is to be oppressors. This is
their model of humanity.
