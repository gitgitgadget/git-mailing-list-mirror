All right.  Though I would say that if it makes the function more
readable, then it might be worth it.

I was actually just wondering.

Actually the default behavior if SIGPIPE is not ignored (or if the
SIGPIPE signal is not blocked / masked out) is to *terminate* the
writing program, which we do not want.

The correct solution is to check for error during write, and check
if errno is set to EPIPE.  This means that reader (filter driver
process) has closed pipe, usually due to crash, and we need to handle
that sanely, either restarting or quitting while providing sane
information about error to the user.

Well, we might want to set a signal handler for SIGPIPE, not just
simply ignore it (especially for streaming case; stop streaming
if filter driver crashed); though signal handlers are quite limited
about what might be done in them.  But that's for the future.


Read from closed pipe returns EOF; write to closed pipe results in
SIGPIPE and returns -1 (setting errno to EPIPE).

Well, at least try it and check if it makes code more readable.

I don't understand your reasoning here ("make it harder to understand the
protocol").  If you choose good names for function writing header, then
the main function would be the high-level view of protocol, e.g.

   git> <command>
   git> <header>
   git> <contents>
   git> <flush>

   git< <command accepted>
   git< <contents>
   git< <flush>
   git< <sent status>

Don't use C++ one-line comments (that's C99-ism).

That would be nice.

That's good, because we have quite a few of those constructs. 
And I think the compiler would inline it, so there is no penalty.

What I meant here (among other things) is that you uselessly use
'cat' to copy files:

    +		cp ../test.o test.r &&
 
>>> +		echo "test22" >test2.r &&
>>> +		mkdir testsubdir &&

I assume that this large file is binary file; what matters is that it
includes NUL character ("\0"), i.e. zero byte, checking that there is
no error that would terminate it at NUL.

I'll end here for now.
