This looks OK to me aside from the one caveat below.

`deactivate_tempfile()` is O(N) in the number of active tempfiles. This
could get noticeable for, say, updating 30k references, which involves
obtaining 30k reference locks. I think that code adds the locks in
alphabetical order and also removes them in alphabetical order, so the
overall effort would go like O(NÂ²). I'm guessing that this would be
measurable but not fatal for realistic numbers of references, but it
should at least be benchmarked.

There are three obvious ways to make this O(1) again:

* Make the list doubly-linked.
* Make sure that all significant callers remove items in the *reverse*
order that they were added, in which case the item to be removed would
always be found near the head of the list.
* Change this class to keep track of a tail pointer and add new items at
the end of the list, and ensure that all significant callers remove
locks in the *same* order that they were added.

The second and third options might be easy or difficult (depend on how
much current callers need to be changed) and certainly would be easy to
break again as new callers are added in the future.
