Perhaps, but even with =true it would equally be useful, as the
point of this setting is to future-proofing.

Not very close, but just too much information without crucial detail
(i.e. log N times what constant???).  I'd drop it.

It may not be technically wrong to say "This changes it to O(1)",
but I think to most people it is more understandable to say "This
changes it to zero" ;-)

    Setting this variable to false makes Git not to validate the
    abbreviation it produces uniquely identifies an object among the
    current set of objects in the repository.  Depending on the
    value of `core.abbrev`, we may be printing abbreviated hashes
    that collide.  Note that setting this variable to true (or
    leaving it unset) does not guarantee that an abbreviated hash
    will never collide with future objects in the repository (you
    need to set core.abbrevLength to a larger value for that).

would be sufficient to clarify, and also nuke the following
overly-detailed paragraph.

Yeah, it goes to too low level a detail, especially with the "try
running" part.  I'd remove everything but "On linux.git in June ..."
if I were writing it from the above.

Yes, but still overly verbose; I think rolling it in the single
paragraph description like I showed above would be sufficient.

Likewise.  If we were to keep it, then s/object ID/object name/.
