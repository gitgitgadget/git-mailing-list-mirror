I'd be willing to be a backup mentor for the project. Even if I'm not 
officially doing any project management and paperwork for it, I'd like to 
be officially supposed to be asked questions about it; I've noticed that 
GSoC students are often shy about asking non-mentor developers to review 
their designs, and I'd like to review this before it's all written and 
under the end-of-summer crunch.
