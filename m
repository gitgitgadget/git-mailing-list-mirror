Yeah, the int types are bit of a mess, but I'd like to defer that to
another series.

There are several things going on here as you point out.

(1) 'int len' for the length of a pathname buffer.  This could be fixed,
but the odds of Git correctly working with a >2Gb pathname doesn't make
this urgent.

(2) 'int i' is signed, but should be unsigned -- but elsewhere in this
function we use 'int pos' which an index on the same array and has
double duty as the suggested insertion point when negative.  So we can
fix the type of 'i', but that just sets us up to hide errors with 'pos',
since they'd have different types.  Also, since it is really unlikely
for Git to work with >2G cache-entries, I think this one can wait too.

I don't mean to be confrontational, but I think these changes should
wait until another series that is focused on just those types of issues.
