=46rom my inspection, StGit works just fine in its "standalone SCM"
role, but falls over somewhat if using it as an additional tool
alongside git itself for a few reasons:

* There's a two-world-view problem with extra commands just to
  translate back and forth (assimilate, commit, uncommit, etc.)

* The new references that StGit introduces can lead to collisions, (it
  happened to me anyway---I ended up having to rm -r .git/refs/bases
  or whatever just to make the ambiguity go away and let me get work
  done with git again).

So, for use as something separate from git, StGit might be just
fine. Otherwise, for being just another tool for users of "git" the
command-line tool, I agree that the current StGit design is a mistake.

I'd much prefer to have a minimal set of new "git" sub-commands that
introduce the new functionality without a separate command namespace
and several sub-commands with redundant functionality compared to
existing git sub-commands.
