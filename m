So basically I have been trying to secure a venue that would be nice
to do this in during October and I've had a horrible time doing it.
I've enlisted the help of someone in Berlin now, since all the places
I personally know and have contacted are sold out or have unreasonable
requirements.

Since I've let it get so close to the original proposed time, I'm
going to push it back until early next year and we can do two
conferences close to each other around Feb or March - 1 in the EU
(Berlin) and one in the US (probably in the SF Bay Area).  I'll get a
website up and running with details asap so people can start planning.

If you would like, I would love to get you in contact with the
GitHubber in Berlin who is helping to secure a venue there so you can
help.

I'm sorry about the opaque communication here, I'll try to be better
about keeping the list up to date on what the current GitTogether
situation is.  Right now it's moved back to early next year so
everyone has enough time.

If people are going to be in town for the Google Mentor Summit,
however, we would love to throw another drinkup in Mountain View for
the Git devs that are here for that, and the Gerrit guys too.

Scott
