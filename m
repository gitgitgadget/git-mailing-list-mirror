Anything's possible, I suppose. But I don't think I'd want that feature
turned on myself.

I was thinking of a tool that could run a series of checks on the
repository and nag about potential problems. One of them could be doing
a round-trip repo->clean->smudge for each file.

Another one might be warning about files that differ only in case.

The idea being that users could run "git lint" if they suspect something
funny is going on. I dunno. It may be a dead-end. Most such
oddities are better detected and handled during actual git operations if
we can. So this would really just be for things that are too expensive
to detect in normal operations.
