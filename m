I think that GSoC2007 was quite nice for us.  And with what we learnt, we 
would do even better in 2008.

However, I simply do not have the time to serve as primary contact.  I am 
willing to be mentor again, though.

As for projects, I imagine that Gitorrent, further builtinification and 
Windows support would be good candidates.

Ciao,
Dscho
