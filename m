I think it is also racy as the renaming breaks the use of mkdir erroring 
out if the directory already exists. One solution is to have a lock 
entry in $GIT_COMMON_DIR/worktree-locks and make sure the code that 
iterates over the entries in $GIT_COMMON_DIR/worktrees skips any that 
have a corresponding ignores in $GIT_COMMON_DIR/worktree-locks. If the 
worktree-locks/<dir> is created before worktree/<dir> then it should be 
race free (you will have to remove the lock if the real entry cannot be 
created and then increment the counter and try again). Entries could 
also be locked on removal to prevent a race there.

Best Wishes

Phillip
