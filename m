I don't like this test ;)

I only intended it as a "here is how to reliably reproduce the
segfault without all the clutter of the full git.git repository" that
I wrote way past my bedtime.  But I think that:

  - it shouldn't have the CASE_INSENSITIVE_FS prereq.  Yes, that
    segfault could only be triggered on a case insensitive filesystem,
    but the given sequence of commands should succeed in a case
    sensitive file system just as well.

    (Have no idea why I added that prereq in the first place; as I
    said above, it was way past my bedtime...)

  - it's in the wrong test script; it would be better among other
    tests checking what 'git checkout' should or must not overwrite
    when switching branches, but not sure which test script that is.

    (I think I added it to this test script, because it stood out a
    bit when grepping for case insensitive fs in the test suite; I
    play the "past my bedtime" card again :)

  - it's already satisfied by 'git checkout master' not failing, but
    it doesn't check whether the resulting contents of the worktree
    are as expected.

  - it still bothers me why that additional subdir was necessary to
    trigger the segfault.  Did you look into it?
