I agree with Eric that we should first and foremost consider the
user-impact of any changes we make to Git.

I think in reality there must be a balance between the two. We should
make reasonable decisions when presented a trade-off between supporting
users and making the lives of Git developers easier. For instance, if
there is some change we could make which would involve a manageable
amount of additional effort, but would somehow benefit the lives of many
users (e.g., supporting more versions of a dependency, improving
performance, fixing a widespread bug, etc.), then we should do that
thing.

On the other hand, if we are bending over backwards as developers to
support a small portion of the user-base (e.g., by maintaining some
ancient version of a dependency that is no longer reasonable because we
can assume that 99.99% of users have a newer version), then we should
consider our options and investigate. What are the ongoing costs to
maintain that minimum version? What features are we missing? How many
users would be affected by dropping support for that version, etc.?

I am not entirely sure whether the jump that brian is proposing is
reasonable or not. The current minimum version of Perl, for example, is
from 2003, but the proposed new minimum is from 2017. While the new
version is certainly not new, I am not sure how many users would be
affected by dragging the minimum version forward by some 14 years.

I do not think it is our responsibility to force people to upgrade their
systems. But OTOH we should not bend over backwards here either to
support ancient versions of dependencies when there are compelling
reasons *not* to use those versions.

I agree with your earlier comment that there is a balance between
thinking about this abstractly and applying it to the real world. But at
some point we have to throw our hands up and stop spending effort
supporting ancient/insecure versions of dependencies.

Indeed. Let's not worry about it for now.
