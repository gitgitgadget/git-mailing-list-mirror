Oops, I don't know how I managed to miss these in my initial commit. It
definitely was not intentional. :)

They were present in the initial patch in 2018:

  https://lore.kernel.org/git/20180817190310.GA5360@sigill.intra.peff.net/

but when I later posted it as part of a series in 2020:

  https://lore.kernel.org/git/20200813150017.GE891370@coredump.intra.peff.net/

they were gone. I guess I must have made some mistake in rebasing it
forward over time. I'm not sure how, though.

Anyway, this is clearly the right thing to do. Thanks for noticing.
