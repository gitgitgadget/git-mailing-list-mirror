It's non-symmetric, yes, but it's what I would personally like. It's
not an essential aspect of the proposal, so it could go either way as
the git crowd decides.

To explain my personal preference, I like the notion of all files
being "untracked" until I inform the system about their
existence. After that, I'd like the system to take care of them and
notice when they get modified, or when they get deleted.

The ability to configure --implicit-delete and --implicit-add to
git-commit seems good. They're long enough arguments that

This case is already under debate in a separate thread. There "git
commit files", (which really is commit-working-tree-content already),
currently errors out in this case, but the proposal is to allow it to
proceed with the commit, (thereby "losing" the intermediate staged
content).
