I think much of the perceived malignancy stems from the fact that the
git list has a high ratio of developer-to-luser mailings on it, being
by nature a developer tool most of the time. When the unaware user
appears on the list with demands rather than polite requests, they're
treated that much harder. Especially by the developer who happens to
be, as it were, the butt of the request.

Personally, I've only ever found Dscho being anything but friendly on
this list, and even then, I really didn't find it offensive. If viewed
in a happy mood, it matches quite nicely with a swedish sketch whose
theme is "men ja ente bitter". It's often quite funny, really :-)

Considering the successes of the wars on alcohol, poverty, drugs and
terror, I think we should give some serious thought to declaring war
on peace.
