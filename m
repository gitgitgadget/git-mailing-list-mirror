OK. Looks like this should keep the same port numbers for all of the
existing tests, which I think is good. As nice as choosing random high
port numbers might be for some cases, it can also be confusing when
there are random conflicts.

I've also run into non-random conflicts, but at least once you figure
them out they're predictable (the most confusing I've seen is that adb,
the android debugger, sometimes but not always leaves a daemon hanging
around on port 5561).

This part is what made me think a bit more about conflicting with
dynamically allocated ports. Arguably the http parts of t0410 ought to
be in a much higher-numbered script, but I don't know that we've held
over the years very well to the idea that scripts should only depend on
the bits from lower numbered scripts.

The patch itself looks good to me.

The quotes in the eval'd variable assignment aren't necessary. Usually I
don't mind them in a simple:

  FOO="$bar"

even though they're redundant (and there were a few instances in the
prior patch, I think). But here the escaping makes it harder to read,
compared to:

  eval port=\$$var

It might be worth simplifying, but I don't feel strongly about it (we'd
run into problems if $var contained spaces with either variant, but I
don't think that's worth caring about).
