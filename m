Indeed I realize that I did not grasp correctly how things are
supposed to fit together.  Reading the code and experimenting, I see
that:

- as you say, send-email completely ignores any pre-existing
In-Reply-To and References header (it does keep the Message-Id's,
though)

- send-email simply adds its own In-Reply-To and References headers.
That IMHO does not make any sense, and the behaviour of such a thing
is likely to vary among MUAs (if it even does not violate the
standards, which I did not check)

- even when --no-thread is specified, and format-patch was run with
--no-thread as well, it still adds In-Reply-To and References headers,
and I must say I do not see what in the code causes this behaviour.

Looks like we should clarify things first, and possibly fix things,
before we can start to document them - or did I miss some point that
would seem obvious to others ?
