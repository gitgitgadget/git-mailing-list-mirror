Yes. I updated it to a relatively recent version just the other week.

Sure, we have been discussing doing that recently.

I need to cleanup how I set up the repository for it tho.

Also probably there are one or two patches that should be pushed back t=
o you.

Ah, I'm not generating it with a separate cgi script, I just replaced
the call to git-archive to be a call to my own tool.

I think that there is some interest in doing that and likely over time
there will be more. It has come up at least a few times in our
discussion forums. I think you could easily make a public call for
support on places like Perlmonks to get more action tho.

A better git api toolset for perl would make things a lot easier.
Especially an XS one.

Sure.
