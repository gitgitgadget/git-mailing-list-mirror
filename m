I am the only one?  I quote from your reply to my original contribution
in this thread:

So here you are telling Jakub off as discourteous and the "only one on
this list apparently not able to use a proper email setup".  And when I
explain that I have been in the same situation with a different account
of mine and that this has nothing to do with discourtesy, the heat turns
over to me.

And, again, this is declared an absolutely isolated phenomenon
restricted to a single person.

I am afraid that I am too stupid to understand what goal is supposed to
be achieved by this sort of behavior.  I don't see anything except
annoyance for everybody involved.
