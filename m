The patches I have sent to the list have all been sent using

   git format-patch something
   $EDITOR *.patch # remove mbox header, and add To:
   for file in *.patch ; do sendmail -t < $file ; done

as every attempt I have done to send them through Alpine or other MUAs have 
failed horribly.

I haven't minded having to edit the patch files manually (since I have also 
visually inspected the patch files in the process), but being able to add 
the To: line for the list automatically for each of the patches lessens the 
risk of misspelling or missing it completely when fixing the patches up.
