I think the overall direction is good. A few small comments below.

It might be worth giving an example of the syntax, like:

  the port number if one was specified (e.g., "example.com:8088").

So we are losing the bit about overriding. I think that is OK, as we'd
like to avoid suggesting that is a good idea, and we may even remove the
feature in the future.

The word "generated" confused me a bit. Maybe something like:

  ...and if the URL doesn't specify a hostname (e.g.,
  "cert:///path/to/file"), the credential will contain a hostname
  attribute whose value is an empty string.

Makes sense.
