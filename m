Well, the goal of this patch was to avoid full tree diffs if possible,
not to avoid rename detection :)

Anyway, I wonder how does 'git log -L1:your-evil-path --no-renames'
fare as a baseline?

Yeah, actual renames are only one of the possible causes that trigger
rename detection.  Surprisingly (well, to me, at least), in git.git
rename detection in line-level log is most often triggered by the
subtree merges of gitk and git-gui, not by actual renames.

Line-level log doesn't do '--full-history', though it does seem to
compute more diffs than a simple 'git log -- path'.

I applied the following diff on current master to add a bit of ad-hoc
tracing to see how many and which commit-parent diffs are computed:

diff --git a/line-log.c b/line-log.c

  $ ./git log --full-history v2.23.0 -- builtin/rev-list.c >/dev/null 2>FH

  $ wc -l P FH LL

    70842 FH
    25995 LL
   114067 total

So line-level log clearly computes a lot less diffs than
'--full-history', though still about 50% more than a regular
pathspec-limited history traversal.  Looking at the commit-parent
pairs in the output, it appears that the difference comes mostly from
merge commits, because line-level log compares a merge commit with all
of its parents.

The number of processed commits is close enough, though:

  $ cut -d' ' -f1 P |sort -u |wc -l
  17164
  $ cut -d' ' -f1 LL |sort -u |wc -l
  17894

It seems there is still more room for improvements by avoiding
commit-non_first_parent diffs when the first parent is TREESAME, and
doing so could hopefully avoid triggering rename detection in those
subtree merges or in case of your evil path.

Erm, no: we always parse the pathspec, even if we DO detect renames.

This condition made 'git log -L... --no-renames' fast.

Renames (and subtree merges, etc.) are rare, so the paths rarely
change, and clearing and parsing pathspecs involves 2-3 memory
allocations and frees per path, so it's worth checking first.  It had
a slight but measurable performance impact, about 2% in the Linux
repository.
