Well, everybody knows who wanted to have that question in the survey, and 
everybody knows why.

My experience is that people come here, ask questions, and get served.  
Often to stay.  So it cannot be that bad.

That is the problem of most surveys.  Usually you can see that after 
50-75% of the questions, people are too bored, and just stop the survey 
right then and there.  Or, if forced, give stupid answers because they are 
annoyed with them.

Given that only one answer hinted at that AFAIR (it was something along 
the lines "I already wasted too much time on this survey, so I cannot work 
on git" or some such), I think you did a good job, though.

Again, thanks for all the work that you did/will do.  I know how tedious 
it is to evaluate such surveys, especially the free form answers.  Must 
have taken you days of real effort.

Ciao,
Dscho
