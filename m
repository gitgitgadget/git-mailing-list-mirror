Interesting, I have a pretty format alias that looks almost like this,
except that I carry a patch locally allowing me to say %as for short
date format :)

What I sometimes wished for is a pretty format specifier for 'git
describe --contains', which would make it convenient to cite commits
like this: v0.99~954 (Initial revision of "git", the information manager
from hell, 2005-04-07).  It's better than the abbreviated object name,
because it will stay unique, assuming that the chosen tag is never
deleted, and it carries extra information for humans (the first release
containing the referenced commit), while the abbreviated object name is
completely meaningless.

The obvious drawback that makes it a non-solution for the problem at
hand is that this format can only refer to commits that are reachable
from a tag and can't be used for commits that are descendants of the
most recent tag, e.g. when fixing a bug introduced after the last
release.  Oh, and the user has to fetch the tag first to be able to
make sense of such a reference.
