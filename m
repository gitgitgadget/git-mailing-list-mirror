Thanks. Student applications start on March 16th, but students may be
looking at our ideas page before then. So if you have been considering
adding entries to the ideas list, please do it soon.

If you are a potential mentor and would like to help evaluate
applications, please create a profile at:

  https://google-melange.com

and connect with the "Git" organization.
