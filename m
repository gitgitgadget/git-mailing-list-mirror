Committing oneself to being on IRC is a time commitment, isn't it?
:-)

IRC time is difficult for me; I do hang out there more often than
I used to now that the community is doing the same, but I spend
a good part of my week working from a network where IRC access
isn't allowed.

Anyway, people did step up (thanks Pasky, Dscho, Brian, Martin,
Martin!) and now most projects have more one mentor.  This is
exactly what I was hoping would happen.
