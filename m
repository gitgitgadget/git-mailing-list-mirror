Er yeah, sorry, I meant to say "aren't".

Yes, that's what I was thinking of.

Ideally, yes. Though thinking on this more, it's racy even today,
because we rely on the in-memory packed_git list. We usually re-check the
directory only when we look for an object and it's missing. So any new
packs which have been added while the process runs will be missed when
doing short-sha1 lookups (and actually, find_short_packed_object does
not even seem to do the usual retry-on-miss).

A normal process like "checkout" isn't writing new packs, but a
simultaneous repack could be migrating its new objects to a pack behind
its back. (It also _can_ write packs, but only for large blobs).

Given that we are talking about finding "unique" abbreviations here, and
that those abbreviations can become invalidated immediately anyway as
more objects are added (even by the same process), I'm not sure we need
to strive for absolute accuracy.

> Can we trust object directory time stamps for cache invalidation?

I think it would work on POSIX-ish systems, since loose object changes
always involve new files, not modifications of existing ones. I don't
know if there are systems that don't update directory mtimes even for
newly added files.

That would still be a stat() per request. I'd be curious how the timing
compares to the opendir/readdir that happens now.
