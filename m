Until now. :)

No, they're not.  And I don't think they should be; HEAD itself is *not*
transient, as a detached HEAD can reference valuable non-transient
objects.

In an ideal world, HEAD and all other such refs would live somewhere
under refs, to avoid the special case.

Why pester at all?  Just leave them, and if the user has large objects
they don't care about and wants to decrease the size of the repository,
they can follow the advice from the git-gc manpage: "If you are
expecting some objects to be collected and they arenâ€™t, check all of
those locations and decide whether it makes sense in your case to remove
those references."  (Where "those locations" will need to expand to
mention "*HEAD".)

(Also, I'd suggest "*HEAD", possibly limited to characters matching
[-_A-Z], rather than "*_HEAD".)
