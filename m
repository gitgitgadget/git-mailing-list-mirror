Speaking of libgit2:

Git provided the libgit2 project with a slot each of the last three GSOC.
The contributions made by the former students (Disclaimer: one of them
speaking) have been quite important for libgit2 and all three students
are still involved. Each project was an important push towards building
a new, feature complete Git library.

Thank you!
