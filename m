Ah, thanks for that, I had not realized "lock" was relevant here as I
have never used it.  That explains some of what seemed to me like a very
strange usage model.

Okay, I see that use case now - I hadn't realized there was an
intentional design decision here, and honestly that's anything but clear
from the *code*.  It's surprising, for example, that my patches didn't
break a single test case.

Okay, will fix.

I don't disagree, but I didn't want to move stuff into an exposed API if
I didn't have to, and that seemed like an appropriate enough header.  I
can do it the other way though, no problem.

Sure thing.

Okay, so just for clarity, when you say there's a deliberate design
decision, which behavior here are you talking about?  If you mean making
"lock" work, I don't have any issue with that.  If you mean not cleaning
up when we do other commands, then I don't see why that's a concern -
after all, that's exactly what "lock" is for.

Assuming it is the "lock" behavior we're talking about, I don't think I
actually have any intention of breaking this design decision, just
making my workflow (without "lock") nag at me less for what seem like
pretty trivial issues.

I can easily accommodate "git worktree lock".  What bugs me though, is
that using worktrees basically means I have to replace fairly regular
filesystem activities with worktree commands, and it doesn't seem to be
*necessary* in any way.  And I'm going to forget.  A lot.

To me, there doesn't seem to be any reason these need to behave any different:

$ git worktree add foo foo
$ rm -rf foo
vs
$ git worktree add foo foo
$ git worktree remove foo

And in fact the only difference right now, aside from some very
minuscule storage requirements that haven't gotten cleaned up, is the
first one leaves an artifact that tells it to give me errors later until
I run "git worktree prune" myself.  

I'll send another revision of this patchset as a reply to this mail,
which should clear up some of our differences.
