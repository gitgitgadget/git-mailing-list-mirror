Yeah, I think that reasoning makes sense.

OK, we can drop this line snice it's now the default. Good.

After this patch, the documentation seems to end abruptly with "The only
practical reason to run". I think we need to either delete those lines,
too, or complete the thought.

I do think they are saying something useful, which is: in "check" mode,
you should always use "--immediate" since the point is just to find
scripts which aren't labeled correctly. But I think that is true whether
you are using the leak log or not. Your log will be incomplete, of
course, if you used "--immediate", but the point is to see whether we
find even one.

This adds back in the test_failure fix from 47c6d4dad2 (test-lib: fix
GIT_TEST_SANITIZE_LEAK_LOG, 2024-06-30), but in a different way. I think
we'd want to build on top, and then you just need to update the messages
on either side of that final elif/else.

I'm not sure why we need to touch this block. The "if
GIT_TEST_SANITIZE_LEAK_LOG" just below it I assumed would go away. But
all of this has to do with "check" versus "true", etc? There might be
new refactoring / simplification opportunities opened up by getting rid
of the LEAK_LOG variable, but we should do those on top.

I guess what's happening is that you've rearranged it so that:

> -	if test_bool_env GIT_TEST_SANITIZE_LEAK_LOG false
> -	then
>  		if ! mkdir -p "$TEST_RESULTS_SAN_DIR"
>  		then
>  			BAIL_OUT "cannot create $TEST_RESULTS_SAN_DIR"

...when this conditional goes away, the existing body is still in the
"else". But even though it would make the diff noisy to reindent, I
think we are better off doing so to make it clear what the actual change
is.

OK, this final elif is responsible for complaining when you set LEAK_LOG
but don't have an actual leak-checking build. But once it goes away,
there's no need to complain. Makes sense.
