Thanks, this looks obviously correct. The problem was introduced by my
6bdb0083be (daemon: detect and reject too-long paths, 2016-10-22).

I don't think it's that big a deal in practice, since we'd always be in
a worker process handling a single request, and will exit immediately
after returning from the function. So you could not, say, convince a
long-running git-daemon to leak a bunch of memory over time.

But definitely still worth fixing.

A common mistake in these kinds of fixes is that the variable to be
freed is used to generate an error message in the early-return path.
Here we put "interp_path" in the message instead. That does mean the
error message shows the truncated name rather than the full one. That
may be a hidden feature, though. :)
