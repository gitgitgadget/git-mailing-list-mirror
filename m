As you can see in 'name-hash.c', 'index_file_exists' and there by
'cache_dir_exists' work using the 'name_hash' stored in the index. If
you look at the flow of 'lazy_init_name_hash', you'll see how
'name_hash' gets initialized and populated despite the value of
'ignore_case'. OTOH, dir_hash is populted only when 'ignore_case' is
true. So, it seems to be that only 'cache_dir_exists' depends on the
value of 'ignore_case'.

To me that appears to be the only way forward other than spawning a
call to ls-files as was done in one of the earlier versions tat was not
sent to the list. Anyways, I'm not the best person to answer this
question. So, I've CC-ed a couple of people who might be able to shed
some light for us.

The above doesn't handle all cases. In particular, we want to handle
the case of tracked files when `force` is not given
(directory_exists_in_index certainly doesn't handle that). We also need
to handle directories with tracked contents when force is given (we
already know cache_name_pos is not sufficient to handle them). So, I
think we would want something along the lines of the following:

        if (read_cache() < 0)
                die(_("index file corrupt"));

        cache_pos = cache_name_pos(path, strlen(path));
        if (cache_pos < 0 &&
            directory_exists_in_index(&the_index, path, strlen(path)) == index_directory) {
                directory_in_cache = 1;
        }

        if (!force) {
               if (cache_pos >= 0 || directory_in_cache)
                        die(_("'%s' already exists in the index"), path);
        }
        else {
                struct cache_entry *ce = NULL;
                if (cache_pos >= 0)
                {
                        ce = the_index.cache[cache_pos];
                }

                if (directory_in_cache || (ce && !S_ISGITLINK(ce->ce_mode))) {
                        die(_("'%s' already exists in the index and is not a "
                              "submodule"), path);
                }
        }

After seeing this, I'm starting to think it's better have this in a
separate helper function instead of making the `module_add` function
even more longer than it already is.

I'm guessing you're looking at it in a more general sense of the
command workflow. I was speaking only about the following snippet of
the shell script which we're trying to emulate now:

        if test -z "$force"
        then
                git ls-files --error-unmatch "$sm_path" > /dev/null 2>&1 &&
                die "$(eval_gettext "'\$sm_path' already exists in the index")"
        else
                git ls-files -s "$sm_path" | sane_grep -v "^160000" > /dev/null 2>&1 &&
                die "$(eval_gettext "'\$sm_path' already exists in the index and is not a submodule")"
        fi

When sm_path is an empty directory or a directory that has no tracked
contents the 'ls-files' command would fail and we apparently will *not*
get an error stating the path already exists in the index. The command
might fail in a later part of the code but that's not what I'm talking
about.

A few other things I noticed:

> +       strbuf_addstr(&sb, path);
> +       if (is_directory(path)) {

I remember mentioning to you that the 'is_directory' check is
sufficient here and the 'is_nonbare_repository_dir' is not necessary
here as 'resolve_gitlink_ref' already takes care of it. Unfortunately,
looks like without the 'is_nonbare_repository_dir' check we get the
following unhelpful error message when the path is a directory that
_exists_ and is ignored in .gitignore:

   $ git submodule add ../git-crypt/ Debug
   fatal: 'Debug' does not have a commit checked out

   The shell version did not have this problem and gave the following
   appropriate error message:

   $ git submodule add ../git-crypt/ Debug
   The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:
   Debug
   hint: Use -f if you really want to add them.
   hint: Turn this message off by running
   hint: "git config advice.addIgnoredFile false"

      So, we should check whether the given directory is a non-bare
      repository before calling 'resolve_gitlink_ref' to be consistent with
      what the shell version does.

      For the note, this isn't caught by the 'submodule add to .gitignored
      path fails' in t7400 as the corresponding directory doesn't exist
      there. So, our 'is_directory' check fails and we don't call
      'resolve_gitlink_ref'.

Using 'die' to print an already formatted error message of a command
results in an additional newline which looks ugly. For reference, here
are the output from the shell and C versions of the command:

-- 8< --
$ # Shell version
$ git submodule add ../parent/ submod
The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:
submod
hint: Use -f if you really want to add them.
hint: Turn this message off by running
hint: "git config advice.addIgnoredFile false"
$ # C version
$ git submodule add ../parent/ submod
fatal: The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:
submod
hint: Use -f if you really want to add them.
hint: Turn this message off by running
hint: "git config advice.addIgnoredFile false"

$
-- >8 --

So, it would be nice if we use 'fprintf(stderr, ...)' or something like
that so that we don't get the additional newline.
