Subject: [PATCH 0/2] routines to generate JSON data

From: Jeff Hostetler <jeffhost@microsoft.com>

This patch series adds a set of utility routines to compose data in JSON
format into a "struct strbuf".  The resulting string can then be output
by commands wanting to support a JSON output format.

This is a stand alone patch.  Nothing currently uses these routines.  I'm
currently working on a series to log "telemetry" data (as we discussed
briefly during Ã†var's "Performance Misc" session [1] in Barcelona last
week).  And I want emit the data in JSON rather than a fixed column/field
format.  The JSON routines here are independent of that, so it made sense
to submit the JSON part by itself.

Back when we added porcelain=v2 format to status, we talked about adding a
JSON format.  I think the routines in this patch would let us easily do
that, if someone were interested.  (Extending status is not on my radar
right now, however.)

Documentation for the new API is given in json-writer.h at the bottom of
the first patch.

I wasn't sure how to unit test the API from a shell script, so I added a
helper command that does most of the work in the second patch.
