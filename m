There are a number of commits from me that actually count.  A few old
core performance ones might have actually have affected my carbon
footprint noticeably.  The one currently in pu will probably not be
called often enough for that but will at least have practical
consequences.

Putting aside my code contributions: Git is a comparatively small
project, so if the main project you are working on with Git is Git, your
experience is limited.  So yes, input from people who are _not_ heavy
Git developers is important, since the heavy Git developers do not get
to see the heavy Git use cases a lot.

More like if they are around, they are worth getting plastered with your
frustration.
