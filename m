When a transition to static pages happens, an important aspect is that
external links that point into git-scm.com must not be invalidated.
There are many such links in Stackoverflow answers, for example.

I checked one link:

https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase#Documentation/git-rebase.txt--r
https://git.github.io/git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase#Documentation/git-rebase.txt--r

and it is looking very good. Thank you! I assume that keeping links
working is not just a happy accident, but part of the plan.
