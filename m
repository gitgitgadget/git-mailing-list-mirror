Please I would like you to keep this proposal as a top secret and delete it if you 
are not interested and get back to me if you are interested for details as regards to
 the transfer of $24,500,000 to you. this money initially belongs to a client who died 
and had no next of kin in his account-opening package. in other to achieve this, I shall 
require your full name, and telephone number to reach you.Most importantly, a confirmation 
of acceptance from you after which I shall furnish you with the full details of this transaction.
