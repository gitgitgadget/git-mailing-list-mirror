Dear diary, on Wed, Oct 18, 2006 at 04:52:25PM CEST, I got a letter
where Linus Torvalds <torvalds@osdl.org> said that...

Took me exactly an hour from mkdir cogito-bundle to cg-push to
kernel.org. :-)

cogito-bundle is an example on how to create third-party addons or
plugins adding own commands to Cogito and using Cogito's infrastructure.
It's not _that_ easy currently since you have to replicate large part of
the build infrastructure locally; that could be fixed by installing some
"library makefiles" and asciidoc toolkit to /usr/share or something, if
there would be a real demand for such an addon API. cg-help and the cg
wrapper will pick up the newly installed commands automagically. The
only thing missing is updating cogito(7) to list the addon commands,
which would take a bit more work.

Though it's an example, it's actually supposed to be useful, by doing
exactly what is outlined above - l - it lets you exchange commits over
mail by so-called "bundles", similar to e.g. Bazaar bundles - basically,
it is like push or fetch, but over email, and the commit ids are
preserved when transferred in bundles (if you just send patches, the
commit ids will end up different).

The provided cg-bundle and cg-unbundle commands are rather crude and
don't support many things - they don't actually include a diff, only a
diffstat, etc. The uuencoded bundle is inlined in the mail, which I
suspect isn't very useful; perhaps it would be more practical to just
attach it binarily. Feel free to send patches (or bundles ;).

An example bundle is available at

	http://pasky.or.cz/~pasky/cp/example-bundle.txt

as generated by

	cogito.master$ cg-bundle -r v0.18 -m"Subject is this" \
		-m"And some body now..." --stdout

and cogito-bundle is available at

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/cogito/cogito-bundle.git/
	(gitweb http://kernel.org/git/?p=cogito/cogito-bundle.git)
