Thanks, Matthieu, for keeping our GSoC activities moving forward. And
thank you to all of the folks who have been helping review microprojects
and proposals.

If there are any other long-time community members who want to read and
comment on the proposals, you can sign up through
https://www.google-melange.com and request to be a mentor for git (you
do not have to mentor, but that is the access level where you get to see
the proposals).
