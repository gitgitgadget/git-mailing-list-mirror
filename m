Hmm. I think it really might be just network latency. Here's my fetch
time:

  $ git config remote.origin.url
  git://github.com/gitster/git.git

  $ time git fetch origin
  real    0m0.183s
  user    0m0.072s
  sys     0m0.008s

14 of those in a row shouldn't take more than about 2.5 seconds, which
is still twice as fast as your parallel case. So what's going on?

One is that I live about a hundred miles from GitHub's data center, and
my ping time there is ~13ms. The other side of the country, let alone
Europe, is going to be noticeably slower just for the TCP handshake.

The second is that git:// is really cheap and simple. git-over-ssh is
over twice as slow:

  $ time git fetch git@github.com:gitster/git
  ...
  real    0m0.432s
  user    0m0.100s
  sys     0m0.032s

HTTP fares better than I would have thought, but is also slower:

  $ time git fetch https://github.com/gitster/git
  ...
  real    0m0.258s
  user    0m0.080s
  sys     0m0.032s
