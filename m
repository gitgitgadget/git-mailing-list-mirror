Yeah, it's likely we'll need to just match the output of "jgit
--version". Since their support is hypothetical at this point, I think
it makes sense to go with your original patch. It does mean we'll later
have to remove the SHA1 prereq from those tests, but that's OK. It's not
very many tests, and your commit message clearly explains what is going
on.
