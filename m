I don't think we want to integrate them, but I'd suggest that
SANITIZE_LEAK_LOG should be the default/only option.

Without it, you are potentially missing leaks in programs whose failing
exit codes do not trigger a test failure. So there is no point in
running PASSING_SANITIZE_LEAK=check without also checking the logs. But
it is still useful to set SANITIZE_LEAK_LOG just for normal runs to look
for leaks.

I don't know of any reason we couldn't always check the logs (for a
leak-checking build), and I didn't see anything in the history. I think
it was written that way only because there is otherwise no affirmative
action by the user to say "and btw, look for leaks" (and if we are not
looking for leaks, there might not be any logs!).

But really, if you have done a leak-checking build, then every run of
the tests is looking for leaks, whether you check the logs or not. So we
should able to just check that $SANITIZE_LEAK is set. And then there
would be one less thing for people checking for leaks to remember to
set.
