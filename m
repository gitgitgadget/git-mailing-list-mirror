Hi,

Exactly.  But it seems a concept hard to understand to some people.  It 
also seems that VCS geeks like scripting, and assume everybody else does, 
too.  Not so.

Most people hate to know the internals.  They buy the car, and never want 
to look inside the motor compartment.  They buy wine, and never want to 
know how it is made.  They buy an iPod and never want to know who 
assembles it, and how, and in what environment.

You cannot teach those people to be more interested/interesting by showing 
them how things work internally.  But you can give Git a bad reputation in 
the process.

This, amongst other reasons, was why a company I worked at had a policy to 
never _ever_ have presentations or tutorials by technical staff.  Never.

Ciao,
Dscho
