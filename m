We could, but it would be an incompatible syntactic change, which we've
so far managed to avoid.

I had a similar thought, but it's quite difficult because of the way
that default values are structured in git. Most code uses initialization
of C variables (including structs) to set up default values, and then
overrides them if it sees relevant config.

So there is no central code to ask "what is the value of X if I don't
provide any config"? It literally requires dumping a bunch of variables.

One thing we could do is move all of those defaults into an "internal"
config that is baked into the executable, and then parse that at the
lowest-priority level of config. And then "git config --list
--show-origin" could presumably just dump it.

But that would mean parsing it at run-time in every program (which is
probably not _that_ much overhead, but does feel wrong). I'd also
suspect there are a few cases whose defaults are expressed in code,
rather than as single variable assignments, and couldn't be represented
as config at all.
