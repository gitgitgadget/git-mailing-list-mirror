It was the same in C99. I think this is one of those cases where we need
to worry less about what the standard says and more about what the real
world does. As long as we're ready for C25 or whatever to add "strvec"
and we accept that we'll need to change the name then, I'm not
particularly concerned. A compiler that starts warning about "str"
functions in the meantime would be impractical I think (forget strbuf,
stuff like strip_extension() would be illegal).

So I almost sent a rant about Coccinelle along with this series. :)

Debian unstable now ships coccinelle 1.0.8, and it's unbelievably slow
compared to 1.0.4. Running "make coccicheck" is currently at 80 minutes
of CPU time running each script in parallel, with none of them down.
They're also all consuming 6GB of RAM each, so I'm killing them all.

I got somewhere similar when I was working on this series, got fed up,
and then just did the whole thing with grep, which was easier. I'm open
to the idea that a slower transition might have helped topics in flight
catch up, but it also would have prolonged the pain. So I dunno.
