Yeah, this paragraph is just a bit of background about how the current
situation came to be and what recent change made the switch possible.

Yes.

Now that you mention it: no.  It would have been possible to install
gcc-8 only in the 'linux-gcc' build job even via the apt addon, namely
by removing the two Linux build jobs from the implicit build matrix
and adding them as two independent build jobs in the 'matrix.include'
section of '.travis.yml'.  The drawback is that all the extra packages
used in both build jobs would have to be duplicated.

Basically yes (though I think it's not about not bothering; I don't
know about others, but it just occured to me that it would have been
doable, however, even if it occured to me earlier, because of the
duplicated list of common packages I wouldn't have done it).

Doing it in good old shell is indeed easier and the common packages
are then only listed once.

Oh, "more reusable" indeed, that's a more eloquent way to put it.
