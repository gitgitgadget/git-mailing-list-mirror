OK, I did a little more editing.  A couple more changes to consider:

At

http://code.google.com/p/google-summer-of-code/wiki/AdviceforMentors

they suggest that smaller completed projects are easier to pick up than
larger unfinished work,  Makes sense to me.  That might suggest a
slightly different approach here:

	"In the unfortunate event that a student abandons and does not
	complete his/her GSoC project, the Git community will try to
	pick up and continue the work without the student.  This is one
	reason why we will require frequent publishing of project
	materials to repo.or.cz."

But I'm not sure what exactly--maybe say something about encouraging
small incremental steps?

Also they suggest that "students should not be forced to do anything
that other contributors do not do, so if the student wants to blog, let
them do so, but do not force them."  So maybe we should ditch the
"weekly project updates" requirement.  Those might not end up being very
substantive anyway.  Maybe replace that with some sort of private
communication with the mentor?  (And the irc office hours thing sounds
like a good idea too--might be worth mentioning.)
