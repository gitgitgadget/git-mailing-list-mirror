Hi Josh

If possible it would be good to be able to run individual test programs 
without a harness as we can for our integration tests. For running more 
than one test program in parallel I think it is fine to require a harness.

I don't have a strong preference for which harness we use so long as it 
provides a way to (a) run tests that previously failed tests first and 
(b) run slow tests first. I do have a strong preference for using the 
same harness for both the unit tests and the integration tests so 
developers don't have to learn two different tools. Unless there is a 
problem with prove it would probably make sense just to keep using that 
as the project test harness.

We have .cirrus.yml in tree which I think gitgitgadget uses to run our 
test suite on freebsd so we could leverage that for the unit tests. As 
for NonStop I think we'd just have to rely on Randall running the tests 
as he does now for the integration tests.

These changes all sound sensible to me

The trimmed down table is most welcome. The custom implementation 
supports partial parallel execution. It shouldn't be too difficult to 
add some signal handling to it depending on what we want it to do.

It sounds like we're getting to the point where we have pinned down our 
requirements and the available alternatives well enough to make a decision.

Best Wishes

Phillip
