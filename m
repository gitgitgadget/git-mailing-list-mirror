This series replaces ds/commit-graph-file-v2, and I'm using the same
gitgitgadget PR to continue the version numbers and hopefully make that
clear. This is a slight modification on patches 1-11 from the incremental
file format RFC [0].

The commit-graph feature is growing, thanks to all of the contributions by
several community members. This also means that the write_commit_graph()
method is a bit unwieldy now. This series refactors that method to use a
write_commit_graph_context struct that is passed between several smaller
methods. The final result should be a write_commit_graph() method that has a
clear set of steps. Future changes should then be easier to understand.

 * Patches 1-4: these are small changes which either fix issues or just
   provide clean-up. These are mostly borrowed from
   ds/commit-graph-format-v2. 
   
   
 * Patches 5-11: these provide a non-functional refactor of
   write_commit_graph() into several methods using a "struct
   write_commit_graph_context" to share across the methods.
   
   

Updates to commits previously in this thread:

 * "commit-graph: remove Future Work section" no longer says that 'verify'
   takes as long as 'write'. [1]
   
   
 * "commit-graph: return with errors during write" now has a test to check
   we don't die(). [2]
   
   

Ã†var: Looking at the old thread, I only saw two comments that still apply to
this series [1] [2]. Please point me to any comments I have missed.

Thanks, -Stolee
