The last article from preed on this topic was equally fun.

Interesting to see the comments on the bottom of the article;
apparently a large number of Git fans have commented about how the
Windows community didn't get involved in development, and are now
pissed that Git isn't equally available for their platform.  ;-)

There's a lot of truth in that - Windows users (that I know
anyway) just want something to work.  Even if they are themselves
a programmer, they don't want to write X, they want someone else
to give them X for free, in a fully functional state.

Which is an attitude that I never see from Linux users...
