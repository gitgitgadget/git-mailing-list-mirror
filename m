I think you're looking for something does not exist because it is platform and environment dependent. There are two ways to configure git to work with 'less' on NonStop and neither is identical to Ubuntu or Windows. Don't even get me started on what less does in a TSO/ISPF environment where everything is some single colour on black unless your emulator supports 3279 emulation.

Nobody, perhaps, knows how to do this on every platform in the known universe ðŸ˜Š. There is no "one way" to do this consistently everywhere.

In addition, there are many different terminal emulators that end up interacting with git and many do not support vt220 colours. So again, I'm not really sure what can be done.
