I don't see much point in introducing include.requiredPath. It might be
useful for people who want to be extra-careful with their includes, but
it would not really help users who simply made a spelling error and
didn't know how to debug it.

So switching the default for include.path and providing an escape hatch
seems like the more useful path (if we indeed want to do one of these;
adding better debugging like GIT_TRACE_CONFIG is yet another option).

As far as deprecation, it depends on what the new behavior is. If it is
simply that include.path will generate a warning on a missing file, I
don't think there is any point in a multi-step dance. The endgame is a
warning, which is no different than the deprecated-stage behavior. :)

If the endgame is to die(), then I'd agree that there should be a
warning in the middle.

Between all those things I mentioned (or simply leaving it as-is), I
really don't have a strong feeling. I hoped people who did would
generate a patch to give something concrete to review.

The thing that #2 buys you is that multiple such bits could be combined.
If we imagine that later there is another choice to make in interpreting
include.path with two options, "foo" and "bar", then we would be stuck
with:

  include.maybeFooPath
  include.maybeBarPath
  include.fooPath
  include.barPath

and of course it only gets worse with a third one.  Whereas with
independent options, you can do:

  [include]
  warnOnMissing = false
  otherPreference = bar
  path = ...

I dunno. The combinatorics might not be too bad if we document the
required order, and actually code the parsing side like:

  if (!skip_prefix(key, "maybe", &key))
	warn_on_missing = 0;
  if (!skip_prefix(key, "foo", &key))
        other_pref = "foo";
  ...and so on

It's kind of hacky, but it does encode the bits into the name. As long
as they remain bits, and not, say, arbitrary strings.
