The stanza-based format of the porcelain output was chosen with the
specific intention of being easy to parse _and_ to allow extension
such as the introduction of new attributes. It is unfortunate that the
documentation you quoted, as well as the description of the porcelain
format itself, does a poor job of (or utterly fails at) conveying that
intention. (Had I been around to review the later iteration(s) of the
series which introduced the porcelain format, I likely would have
pointed out these shortcomings, however, Real Life had other ideas,
and I didn't manage to review it until weeks after the series had made
it into an actual release.)

I'm not convinced, though, that we're locked into exactly the few
attributes shown only in an example in the porcelain section of the
documentation. That documentation is so woefully underspecified --
indeed, it doesn't even talk about what attributes are available, but
only gives a single example showing some of the (possible) attributes
-- that it effectively makes no promises about what will or will not
appear in a stanza. (The only thing is says strongly is that stanzas
will be separated by a blank line -- despite the intention all along
being that each new stanza would start with a "worktree" attributes,
and that blank lines, if output, were to be ignored.)

So, I am of the opinion that we are not prevented from adding new
attributes, such as "locked" and "prunable".

Yep, I believe my thinking at the time was that the lock reason and
the prunable reason would be escaped if needed. So, for instance:

    worktree /blah
    branch refs/heads/blah
    locked Sneaker-net removable storage\nNot always mounted

> I would say that this is beyong the scope of this patch series :)

Oh, I wasn't suggesting that this series do anything of the sort.
Instead, I was merely responding to the point in the commit message
that the porcelain format was lacking information about the lock, and
to say that it could (eventually) be solved by extending the output.
