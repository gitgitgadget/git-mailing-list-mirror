I was going to say that I do have CI set up[0] to run the subtree
tests on Windows, and was going to ask for assistance in figuring out
how to set up CI's Windows to match the behavior that you're seeing
with Cygwin.

However, upon closer inspection: Because of how run-test-slice.sh
works, it wasn't actually running the subtree test on Windows.  Oops.

Now, that CI setup was just on my personal copies and hadn't been
submitted upstream, since I wasn't sure if it was welcome[1].  I never
really got a reply to that part, but but now that we've got buy-in
from Ævar for running the tests in contrib/,[2] I might spend some
more time on it and try to get that submitted.  That is, if Felipe
doesn't beat me to it[3].
