Nobody can qualify to become a WSEAS Reviewer without proper academic qualifications 
(i.e. recent publications in SCOPUS and ISI). 

Reviewers whose review work is not 
thorough or who are not longer active are immediately removed from our reviewers' list:
http://www.wseas.org/wseas/cms.action?id=5321
Therefore, our list only includes active reviewers. 

The names of all conference reviewers are also published in the WSEAS post-conference reports.
See:  http://www.wseas.org/wseas/cms.action?id=87

Additionally, WSEAS is the only academic publisher with open access journals 
(public PDF on the web plus hard copy), where the authors do not pay any article processing fees.
See: http://www.wseas.org/wseas/cms.action?id=43
