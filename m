Yeah, this makes sense. The primary benefit of $TEST_SHELL_PATH was to
get better support for special testing options (like using bash's
trace_fd with "-x"). But based on recent patches I guess you were
wanting to test the behavior of an unusual shell. And if we're testing
how the test framework runs, certainly using TEST_SHELL_PATH is the most
sensible thing.
