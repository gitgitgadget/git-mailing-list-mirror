In case one of my other mails didn't arrive, the Git version is 1.7.8.

There is no session transcript because I use TortoiseGit and I'm not
going to add a screencast here.

Well, I am very confused. Starting from git-scm.com, the only support
site is a mailing list, and the hyperlink on that word sends me to Gman=
e
which says I am in a newsgroup called "gmane.comp.version-control.git".
Since I don't have access to the news system, I need to use the Gmane
website. I don't know exactly what it is. I know mailing lists, but tha=
t
doesn't look like one at all. There's not even a subscription page or
address. For users of the modern web who are not familiar with 70s nntp
technology and cannot use a mailing list by merely knowing its address,
this is very support-unfriendly. I almost would have considered that th=
e
official Git website doesn't want to offer any support at all. In that
case I would likely have searched for an alternative and switched right
away. Assuming I could have extracted the remainders of my source code
from the broken Git repository.

So am I now subscribed to that "git@vger.kernel.org" mailing list and d=
o
my posts show up there? I have no idea what's going on, neither in my
repository, nor in this mailing list. Confusing and intransparent.
