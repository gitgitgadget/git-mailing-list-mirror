since this is a Ruby on Rails site, could the 'five links' that have been 
bothering people be randomly selected? if every time you go to the site 
you get a different list of projects it show how broadly git is used. it's 
not as 'in your face' as managing to select five that cause people to say 
"wow, they're using this", but different people will react to different 
sites.

if this table gets populated by GitHub, kernel.org, and a couple other 
sources it should be vendor independant enough (and we need a table like 
this anyway for the 'list of projects that use git', so it serves two 
purposes)
