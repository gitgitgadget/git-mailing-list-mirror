Dear diary, on Wed, May 03, 2006 at 09:21:54PM CEST, I got a letter

Then who will keep it in sync (BOTH ways)? That would be quite a lot of
work, I think.

That said, having the documentation in a wiki is not a bad idea per se,
but you need to keep things consistent and converging. And I believe
(and hope) that killing Documentation/ directory is no option - I hate
it when documentation of software I installed just tells me "look at
this URI" (which documents a different version anyway, and it's all very
useful when I'm sitting in a train with my notebook).

Right now I am having amnesia and deja-vu at the same time.  I think
I have forgotten this before.
