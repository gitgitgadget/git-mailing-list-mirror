Yes, this is known. The commit dates are used as a proxy for graph
height (or generation numbers, if you prefer) so that we avoid having to
walk all the way down to a merge base before producing any output. But
it can give the wrong answer in the face of clock skew.

We walk back five extra commits more than we need to in order to avoid
small runs of skewed commits, but obviously you can have arbitrary-sized
runs.
