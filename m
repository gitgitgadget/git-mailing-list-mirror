OK, so that's just one pack (with a few million objects, which is
expected).

Now that surprises me. However, I can reproduce the issue with a fresh
clone of gcc:

  $ git clone https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc
  $ cd gcc
  $ git diff --quiet ;# works!
  $ find . -type f | xargs touch ;# dirty the index entry for each file
  $ git diff --quiet
  fatal: mmap failed: Cannot allocate memory

There are ~100k files in that repo. If we mmap each one as part of
diff_populate_filespec(), we're going to end up with too many maps.

So we can easily reproduce this case without having to download the huge
gcc repo:

  git init repo
  cd repo
  for i in $(seq 70); do
    mkdir $i
    for j in $(seq 1000); do
      echo "foo" >$i/$j
    done
  done
  git add .
  git commit -m 'add a bunch of files'

  git diff --quiet
  git ls-files | xargs touch
  git diff --quiet

That is curious, and I can reproduce it here.

In the non-quiet case, we queue each filepair that we find to be
stat-dirty. And then we call diffcore_skip_stat_unmatch() from
diffcore_std() on the whole list. We load each file singly, see that
it's not really a change (the index entries are just stat-dirty because
of our touch), and then discard it.

Whereas in the --quiet case, we hit this code in diff_change when
queuing each:

          if (options->flags.quick && options->skip_stat_unmatch &&
              !diff_filespec_check_stat_unmatch(options->repo, p))
                  return;

          options->flags.has_changes = 1;

That code is trying to make sure we accurately set the has_changes flag
in quick/quiet mode (because we can stop diffing as soon as we see a
single change). Since none of these changes is interesting (they're all
just stat-dirty entries), we have to keep going and look at each one.
But this code leaves the populated filespec in the queue. Doing this
makes "diff --quiet" succeed in this case:

diff --git a/diff.c b/diff.c
index d1ad6a3c4a..2535614735 100644
--- a/diff.c
+++ b/diff.c

 	options->flags.has_changes = 1;
 }

But that's only because these aren't "real" changes. If we swap out our
"touch" for:

  git ls-files | while read fn; do
    echo bar >$fn
  done

then we have real changes. Our --quiet case will exit immediately once
it sees a change, so it's OK. But now the non-quiet one will fail,
because it's going to load each file to confirm that it's an actual
change, but leave the mmap in place for when we do the actual
content-level diff.

So I think in general we do have problems diffing more than 65k working
tree files in a single process because of this limit. It may still be
worth doing something along the lines of the patch above, though,
because it seems more likely for somebody to have 65k stat-dirty files
than 65k actual changes.
