This is missing the point slightly. If you ask a question on this  
list now it will be read by a lot of people who know git intimately  
and will help in very short order. These are the people who come to  
the list for other things (development discussions, patches, etc). If  
you split the group these people will not see your questions so they  
won't get answered. How does that help the community or make it  
stronger? It might well fracture the community into two groups: One  
that is now free to get even more development done, and one that  
never gets any of its questions answered!

That said, this list is very high traffic. If you want to reduce that  
why not filter out all mails with things like "[PATCH", "[BUG]", etc  
in the title and you'll just about have your git-users list!

Cheers,
Rob
