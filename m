My point was that we already had the confusion of mental models, with
both sides essentially thinking they had an "exact rename", hence my
thought was to add a rather distinct technical name which reflected the
Git mind-shift. Without something to bring folks up short they'll
continue, erroneously, with their prior mental models.

I'd agree that BLOBSAME is new, but we should be proactive in ensuring
folk do have the mind shift from the old centralised VCS misunderstandings.

Isn't that what I thought I'd said?
Hash A = Hash A => identical content;
Hash A != B => different content.

true, the terminology hasn't kept up with the methodology for blob
content, and the independent meta-data. In previous 'ort' discussions I
didn't really understand what the '1/2' renames (and other
nomenclatures) really meant with respect to paths, filenames, content
and the ours / theirs / base distinctions.

definitely easy to get confused on these cases...

Thanks for the insights.
