There are already are multiple mechanisms (e.g., http.* config). So that
ship has sailed. ;)

I did create the way git credential matches repo urls. And I do not
think your proposal is a good idea. The credential system is about
interacting with a remote URL, and creating a commit object is a local
operation. That mismatch leaks through when you work with multiple
remotes, since it is not clear which URL we would match against when the
operation does not involve a remote at all.

If you want to have per-repo name/email for creating commits, right now
your option is to have conditional config based on the local filesystem
path.

Elsewhere in this thread[1] Ã†var suggested having conditional config
directives based on the presence of a remote. I'm a little hesitant
there because it requires the config parsing to depend on the value of
another key (introducing subtle timing dependencies). But aside from
bizarre corner cases (e.g., including config for remote.* via a
conditional include on the remote.* config), I think it would do what
you want and would be generally useful.

That seems like a more fruitful direction to me.
