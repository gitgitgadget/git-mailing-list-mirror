Remarks:

- I find the visual layout of footnotes to 10 ("What do you use to edit contents under
  version control with Git?  What kind of editor, IDE or RAD you use working
  with Git?") a little distracting. Could those at least be seperated by a newline?


- I'm not sure if question 16 ("How often do you use the following forms of git
  commands or extra git tools?") isn't a little too much. At least I got scared by looking
  at all questions in there and I imagine that people get easily bored answering them.

- The same might be true for question 17 and 18.


Overall, I like the survey.
