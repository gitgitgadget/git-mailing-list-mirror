Hello everyone,

I applied for the project "Use JavaScript library / framework in
gitweb" which sadly didn't get a slot this year's GSoC. I would love
to work on this project in my summer vacation as nobody else got the
project and is working on it now. It would be great if someone among
you can spare some of your time for me and be a mentor to help me out
in this task. I am planning to stick to the GSoC schedule and finish
it as early as possible in a good manner.

I have my university break coming soon and will be able to work on
this from 2nd May to 20th July investing as much as time this
requires. Its quite sad that I have to do this without the GSoC tag or
money, but I really want to finish something I started already. I hear
by see this as an opportunity to   contribute back to a tool which I
heavily use on a day to day basis.

Any sort of help would be greatly valued.
