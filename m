No worries. I will push on with trying to get asciidoc to build so that I can generate the man pages. That probably won't happen soon, so I'll keep MacGyvering. I do get generating is the better solution, but I would rather focus my own efforts on keeping up with git (that ports fairly easily and is essential to work life) than burning off $DAYJOB hours on asciidoc and/or xmlto.

Cheers,
Randall
