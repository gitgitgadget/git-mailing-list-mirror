Very nice. All the patches look good to me.

The "from" and "to" variants of the options are a little awkward; these
are really properties of the actual endpoints. It would be nice if we
had some fixed syntax that defined the whole state, like:

  ./doc-diff asciidoc:HEAD asciidoctor:HEAD^

or something. But I think as you introduce new options (like the
header/footer cutting) that syntax would get pretty unwieldy. So
probably the separate options is the best way forward.

I think what's here is fine for now. This is our own internal script, so
if options become useless later on, we can always cull them.

Yeah, mine too.
