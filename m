Great, thanks for testing!

Re-reading what I wrote about end-of-file above and thinking about the
conversation with Ã†var elsewhere in the thread, I suspect it _is_ easy
to get overlapping writes if the processes are receiving signals (since
clearly the TERM signal caused a partial write).

My experiment doesn't simulate that at all. I suppose the parent process
could send SIGUSR1 to the child in each loop, and the child would catch
it but keep going.

Hmm, that was easy enough to do (programs below for reference), but
surprisingly it didn't fail for me (except for the normal end-of-file
truncation). It's like the OS is willing to truncate the write of a
dying program but not one for a signal that is getting handled. Which is
great for us, since it's exactly what we want, but makes me even more
suspicious that a non-Linux kernel might behave completely differently.

I still think we're fine in practice, as I'd expect any kernel to be
atomic under the page size. So this was mostly just for my own
edification.
