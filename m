No.  I will not do it, because the marginal cost of getting to
know not only git but also its source is too high for my precious
time ATM.  Maybe next year.

Will you do it for me if I buy you some beer?  If I promise to
(continue to) proofread git documentation for a couple of months?
If I do more audit of git's shell code, searching for nonportable
constructs?  Or if I promise to try to help you with any autotools
issue you might have?  Or would money be needed?  This:

> Implementing that feature would be a piece of cake [...]

doesn't sound like it, but I would understand very well if it
needed that.

Please consider that division of work really can be advantageous
and that not all git users want to be or can be developers at all
times.

Cheers,
Ralf
