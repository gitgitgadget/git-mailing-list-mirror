I think those numbers are pretty meaningless seeing as GitHub =20
encourages people to publish "forks" of other projects. Rails, for =20
example, has about 270 forks at the time of writing. If I scan the =20
list of popular projects I see fork counts like 129, 105, 78 and 78 =20
(again). Are all the forks counted in that figure of 10,560 that you =20
count? How many "real" projects are hosted there?

I'd like to see the "official" Git homepage as distanced as possible =20
from GitHub. They've taken Git (free as in speech, free as in beer) =20
and built a closed-source commercial product on top of it -- curiously =
=20
for something which you can do for free yourself anyway -- and as far =20
as I can tell from observing this mailing list and watching the =20
commits going into git.git, haven't ever contributed _anything_ back =20
to the community. At least within the niche that is the Ruby/Rails =20
community, GitHub has basically done a hijack job and managed to =20
become synonymous with Git, supplanting it, and it's a trend that I =20
wouldn't like to see continue.

Just my personal opinion, but GitHub doesn't provoke any warm fuzzy =20
feelings here. Quite the contrary. I actively dislike it.

Cheers,
Wincent
