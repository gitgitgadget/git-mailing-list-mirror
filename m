I can accept that argument.

With "fix" I was referring to the backwards-compatibility problem,
(that I don't have a way to give branch checkout instructions to users
that will work for both 1.5 and pre-1.5 versions of git). As is, if
I provide instructions that don't match the version the user has, then
the user will see a rather confusing message:

	git checkout: updating paths is incompatible with switching branches/forcing
	Did you intend to checkout 'origin/8801' which can not be resolved as commit?

[And perhaps the message above is evidence for too much DWIM in the
interface already---that checkout will accept either a revision
specifier or a path name and do fairly distinct operations depending
on which it gets.]

If my tail-matching-for-remotes idea won't fly, are there any other
suggestions for a way to provide instructions for this step that would
work across both 1.4 and 1.5 versions of git?

Well, ideally git would explain the ambiguity with something like
this:

	There are multiple "proposed-fix" remote-tracking
	branches. Please specify which you would like:

		origin/proposed-fix
		something-else/proposed-fix

And I would think that this would not even be surprising since the
user would not get into this situation by default, but would actually
have to have added an additional something-else remote before being
able to get this kind of ambiguity.

But, like I said, I'm glad to accept that the tail-matching idea is a
bad idea. Feel free to drop that on the floor. I'm more interested in
the compatibility issue.

-Carl
