The recent thread about the git-scm.com website raised some discussion
about money, and a lot of people offered financial assistance. As I said
in that thread, we _don't_ have a dire need for money to keep hosting
the site.

But we do sometimes need money for other things (like conference
travel), and we rely on services (like accounting and legal advice)
provided by the Software Freedom Conservancy which are free to us, but
funded ultimately by donations.

I went into detail on our project activities and finances recently at:

  http://public-inbox.org/git/20170202024501.57hrw4657tsqerqq@sigill.intra.peff.net/

If you are interested in contributing financially, you can either donate
to the Git project (10% of which goes to Conservancy's general fund, and
the rest ends up in Git's account):

  https://git-scm.com/sfc

Or you can donate directly to Conservancy's general fund:

  https://sfconservancy.org/donate/

They also have an annual Supporter program, which includes the
all-important t-shirt:

  https://sfconservancy.org/supporter/

Through February 13th, there's an anonymous donor matching all Supporter
signups and renewals, so any donation you make before then will go twice
as far.
