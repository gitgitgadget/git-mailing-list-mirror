No worries.  Regarding disabling the advices for disabling the advice 
messages, maybe it would be better to have only one configuration knob 
for that purpose, e.g. "core.verboseAdvice", as a boolean knob.  That 
way, fishing for the right knob for some advice message wouldn't turn 
itself into an issue, and the users would be able to turn the additional 
"advices about advices" on and off easily, to be able to see what knobs 
actually turn off the advice messages that have become annoying enough 
to them.
