Those were never supposed to work. I'm mildly surprised that they did.
It looks like the username/password check here is what prevented us from
matching an empty line against a very broad pattern:

          while (strbuf_getline_lf(&line, fh) != EOF) {
                  credential_from_url(&entry, line.buf);
                  if (entry.username && entry.password &&
                      credential_match(c, &entry)) {
                          found_credential = 1;

And there was no such thing as a comment character. E.g., a
"commented-out" url like this:

  $ echo "#https://user:pass@example.com/" >creds

would still be matched:

  $ echo host=example.com | git credential-store --file creds get
  host=example.com
  username=user
  password=pass

I guess I'm not really opposed to adding this as a feature, but I think
the justification should be "because it is somehow useful" and not
because it's a bugfix.

q_to_cr is a little weird here, as we wouldn't expect there to be CRs in
the file. They do get removed by strbuf_trim(), even in non-comment
lines. But perhaps "sed s/Q//" would accomplish the same thing (making
the whitespace more visible) without making anyone wonder whether the CR
is an important part of the test?
