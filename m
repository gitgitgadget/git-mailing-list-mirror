Oh, I think that's a great idea. I had proposed cutting the WANT list
down to a single commit, but I wasn't clever enough to think to also
cut down the HAVE walking to solve the problems that would have been
introduced by shallow clones.

And I think the resulting behavior is quite reasonable. I think one
can argue a sort of zero-one-infinity rule here. With history, either
you don't care about any of it, or else you really should care about
all of it.
