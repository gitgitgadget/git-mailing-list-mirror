Try to join the Software Freedom Conservancy and retain the funds
for Git's use?  Maybe you can slide in before the Dec 31st deadline.

I know a few users of Git have said they can't contribute code, but
they would like to throw $25-50 towards a developer to say thank you.
This would give them an easier vehicle to do that.

I'm not saying we should actively seek donations, we have virtually
no expenses and don't need them.

But we do sometimes have these GitTogether things, or one of us is
going to a Linux Plumbers conference or something to give a talk
promoting Git.  Having $500 from a handful of donations available
to defray Git related travel costs for some of our more active
developers is more useful than having a user send something from
an Amazon wish list [1][2].

At worst, if we collect a bunch of money and realize "Oh, wait,
we have like $8000 USD and we haven't spent any of it in the past
5 years!" we can have the SFC do a big donation to FSF or something
and say "thanks for GCC!".

If joining the SFC proves too difficult, just donate the $500 to
the FSF.  That's what we did the first year we were in GSoC.


[1] At least, to me.  My apartment isn't big enough for the crap
    I already own, I don't need more crap shipped to it.

[2] This remark is due to a user on #git the other week wondering
    why I don't have an Amazon wish list, as he wanted to send me
    something to thank me for some feature I wrote eons ago.
