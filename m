Sorry for the delay.  I've finally looked at fixing this.  It turns out
that dash's behaviour is actually correct and POSIX compliant.

It's correct because dash treats all single quotes within double
quotes (except those within command substitutions) as literals.
This interpretation is also supported by POSIX.

In fact the rationale (C.2.2.3) in the POSIX document explicitly
disallows the aformentioned usage as it violates the rule that an
even number of single quotes if any can occur in an ${...} expression
enclosed by double quotes.

So the correct and portable expression in this case would be either

echo "${foo%\}}"

or

brace=}
echo "${foo%$brace}"

Cheers,
