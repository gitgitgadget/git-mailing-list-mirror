FWIW, I think this should be open to all. Most of the time I first look 
at a few posts of a list before joining, just to get an idea if the list 
is actually what I'm interested in. Restricting topic visibility to 
group members only makes doing that impossible. In fact, that's just 
what I did before writing this email. I wanted to see what kind of 
messages are on the list/group before making up my mind if I want to be 
a part of it.

So unless there's some strong reasons to keep it member-only, I vote for 
opening it up.

This I agree with. If you're looking for mentorship, or are providing 
mentorship, you should at least join the group :)
