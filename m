Right, it fails for me, too. But only on the new test "noop
filter-branch complaisn". The old one "filter commands are still
checked" should pass after my patch.

Correct. We usually die when we see a null sha1. So this only kicks in
when GIT_ALLOW_NULL_SHA1 is set, which basically means when
filter-branch is running. And of course there it only kicks in when you
actually have a null sha1, which is a rare error case (and you must be
removing it with your filter, or write-tree will barf anyway).

I don't think it's producing them. It's just that the check in
write-tree isn't triggering for some reasons. If I run t7009 with
GIT_TRACE=1, the failing test shows:

  trace: built-in: git 'read-tree' '-i' '-m' 'e3ed0c3a94f05540151bd8cb9ac647b8777964a6'
  error: invalid object 160000 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 for 'broken'
  warning: cache entry has null sha1: broken
  trace: built-in: git 'cat-file' 'commit' 'e3ed0c3a94f05540151bd8cb9ac647b8777964a6'
  trace: built-in: git 'write-tree'

That last write-tree _should_ barf, but it doesn't. I suspect the reason
is that in the read-tree step, we do not properly strip the cache-tree
when we see the null sha1, so it just gets reused later. But I couldn't
reproduce it when running t1601, which does roughly the same steps.

If I instrument it like this:

diff --git a/read-cache.c b/read-cache.c
index 15a4779f2..4d9482092 100644
--- a/read-cache.c
+++ b/read-cache.c
@@ -2268,9 +2268,10 @@ static int do_write_index(struct index_state *istate, int newfd,
 		if (err)
 			return -1;
 	}
+	warning("drop_cache_tree = %d", drop_cache_tree);
 	if (!strip_extensions && !drop_cache_tree && istate->cache_tree) {
 		struct strbuf sb = STRBUF_INIT;
-
+		warning("reusing cache tree");
 		cache_tree_write(&sb, istate->cache_tree);
 		err = write_index_ext_header(&c, newfd, CACHE_EXT_TREE, sb.len) < 0
 			|| ce_write(&c, newfd, sb.buf, sb.len) < 0;

then I see:

  trace: built-in: git 'read-tree' '-i' '-m' 'e3ed0c3a94f05540151bd8cb9ac647b8777964a6'
  error: invalid object 160000 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 for 'broken'

  trace: built-in: git 'write-tree'

So we end up in do_write_index twice, and one time we copy the cache
tree. I don't know how cache-tree works with the split index. Is it
possible that we write the cache-tree covering the entry for "broken"
into a separate index than the "broken" entry itself? That would explain
what I'm seeing.

I couldn't reproduce here, but it looks like it comes from Ren√©'s new
SWAP macro. It doesn't detect a noop swap, and we may call memcpy with
identical src and dst parameters. That's _probably_ fine in practice,
but we may want to exit the function early.

I'll ping separately in that thread.
