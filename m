That muddiness of that statement is a consequence of my recent 
encounter[1] in which the assumption (that the prefix(refs/heads/ always 
exists) of that code failed. I had a little suspicion, when I wrote that 
commit message, that there might be other cases in which assumption 
might fail. The issue has been resolved only in 3/4 of 
jc/branch-name-sanity but that was only after I wrote the commit message 
initially.  So, it does make sense to remove that muddiness now. Thanks 
for noting that.

Makes sense. Of course, only if there aren't any code paths that lead to 
a state where the expected prefix doesn't exist. Hope, there's none!

Nope.


Footnotes:
[1]: Note the 'warning: ' message in the following mail. That ugly '|ï¿½?' 
was a consequence of the assumption that the 'prefix' always existed!
