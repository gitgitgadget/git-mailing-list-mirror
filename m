you are right. It is exactly what I was looking for. I just saw it some
minutes ago, when I pulled the latest git tree. However to make an old
GCC 2.95 happy, the attached patch is needed.

I am not sure if it is fully working. It deletes a lot of old packs, but
in case of the linux-2.6 tree it leaves on additional behind.

.git/objects/pack/pack-4d7682fb8230fef33eb518fa8e53885ec675795e.idx
.git/objects/pack/pack-4d7682fb8230fef33eb518fa8e53885ec675795e.pack
.git/objects/pack/pack-b3c6fbdfa36a326815de6358885c7a570a986b1b.pack
.git/objects/pack/pack-b3c6fbdfa36a326815de6358885c7a570a986b1b.idx

The 4d76... is the current pack, but the b3c6... is an old one that is
not needed anymore.

Regards

Marcel
