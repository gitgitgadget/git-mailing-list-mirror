Actually, every time I've met Theo in person (which isn't all that often, 
mainly at Usenix), he's been quite nice.

I just suspect that he's even more opinionated than I am (yes, it's 
possible), and thinks that everybody who disagrees with him is wrong by 
definition.

Now, admittedly I do that too, so maybe the difference isn't that big 
after all (and if somebody calls me "difficult", I'd think he's trying to 
be polite too ;).

I think I'm more likely to have areas that I don't care about, and will 
say "whatever" to than Theo. That may be the _real_ difficulty with him: 
anything he doesn't care for, he says "no" to.
