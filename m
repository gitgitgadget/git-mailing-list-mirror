I agree.  Unfortunately though it seems only 3 of us out of 855
current subscribers to the git mailing list have anything to say
on the subject in the past couple of days. :-\

I'd be willing to do it again, as well as mentor a student.  I found it
very interesting last year.

Yea, Gitorrent would be cool.  Especially since send-pack is
somewhat heavy on the server's resources and there are some very
popular projects offered in git format (hello Linux kernel!).

I'd love to see new features added to git-gui, but I'm being selfish.
Ditto with jgit and egit, though I think Robin has done a stellar
job with them thus far.  I can still want them to grow.

pack v4 (or maybe v5?! a student could have better ideas then we
have thus far come up with) would also be interesting.

My list could probably go on for a bit.
