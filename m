Hey all,

As you may remember, we did not have a GitTogether last year.  Since I
miss drinking and talking Git nerdiness with all of you, I'm going to
try organizing some face time on a semi-regular basis.  I would like
to try to do a small Git conference in the US and the EU each year.

We're starting off in Berlin, May 9-11th.  GitHub has secured
conference space at the Radisson Blu Berlin for those days.  I have a
smaller room for the first day so we can get 30-40 Git implementors
together to talk about the future of Git and whatnot.  The second day
will be a user day where many more people can come in and talk about
how they use Git, what they would like to do with it, stuff they've
built on JGit or libgit2, issues they have, etc.  The third day will
be a hack day where I can hold some training sessions for newbies and
all you hard core guys can hack on stuff in person.

There will be a dinner for implementors the first night and a drinkup
open to the public the second night.

It's going to be a really fun event, I hope you can make it.  I set up
a website for the event here:
