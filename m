I beg to differ (of course, since I always know precisely what I do, and 
like you, my code never has bugs).

Seriously though, the trg_entry has not to be protected at all.  Why? 
Simply because each thread has its own exclusive set of objects which no 
other threads ever mess with.  They never overlap.

No.  Once again, it is impossible for two threads to ever see the same 
src->data at all.  The lock is there simply because read_sha1_file() is 
not reentrant.

For now it is, but I wouldn't say it really needs significant work at 
this point.  The latest thread patches were more about tuning than 
correctness.

What the threading could be doing, though, is uncovering some other 
bugs, like in the pack mmap windowing code for example.  Although that 
code is serialized by the read lock above, the fact that multiple 
threads are hammering on it in turns means that the mmap window is 
possibly seeking back and forth much more often than otherwise, possibly 
leaking something in the process.

Linus, please pay attention to the _actual_ important issue here.

Sure I've been tuning the threading code in parallel to the attempt to 
debug this memory usage issue.

BUT.  The point is that repacking the gcc repo using "git repack -a -f 
--window=250" has a radically different memory usage profile whether you 
do the repack on the earlier 2.1GB pack or the later 300MB pack.  
_That_ is the issue.  Ironically, it is the 300MB pack that causes the 
repack to blow memory usage out of proportion.

And in both cases, the threading code has to do the same 
work whether or not the original pack was densely packed or not since -f 
throws away every existing deltas anyway.

So something is fishy elsewhere than in the packing code.
