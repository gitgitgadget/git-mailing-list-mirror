I think that's reasonable, especially as we grow. However, one of the
valuable things (for me, anyway) in previous GitTogethers is throwing
all of these people together to some degree. I'm not terribly interested
in day-to-day Gerrit issues, but sometimes the discussions start from
some minor Gerrit annoyance, and we end up realizing that the right
solution involves changes at a more fundamental layer, and all of git is
better as a result. I'd hate to lose that developer/user interaction.

Maybe we can be segmented for part of the conference, and then bring
everybody together for other parts. I dunno. I guess that involves
predicting which parts will be useful for everybody to be together.

I assume we'll keep largely to the un-conference format, though, so
these are issues that can be ironed out in the first hour as we see
which topics people are interested in discussing.
