This raises some of the same questions as the previous one on whether
hex_to_bytes() is the ideal abstraction. But as before, I'm on the
fence.

Now that this is one big conditional for "is this a valid object
filename", I think we could get rid of the "continue" in favor of:

  if (...looks like an object...)
          ...call obj_cb...
  else if (cruft_cb)
          ...call cruft_cb...

Not a big deal, but it may make the flow more clear (the original had to
use a continue because there were multiple independent steps to
determining it was an object file, so we had to "break out" from the
inner conditional).
