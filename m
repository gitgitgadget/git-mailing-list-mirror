So I think it's been covered elsewhere that single quotes aren't a thing
in git's config format. I will say that this was actually a minor
surprise to me, after a decade of working with the format. ;)

I don't know if it's worth changing now or not It would be
backwards-incompatible, but I wonder if we could do it in a sane way.
E.g., with a rule like:

  - if the first non-whitespace character of the value is a
    single-quote, assume the value is quoted and apply normal shell
    rules (i.e., no backslash escapes until the ending single-quote)

  - otherwise, single-quotes are not special at all

That would allow things like:

  [diff "foo"]
  textconv = some_shell_hackery 'with quotes' | foo

to continue working, but make:

  [some]
  path = 'this has "double quotes" in it!'

do what the user probably intended. It would be a regression for anybody
who literally has a value that starts with a single-quote, but that
seems like it would be pretty rare. Or I dunno, maybe people do it on
Windows to try to protect path-names that get interpreted by the shell.

That sounds like a bug in git bash, if it is not treating single quotes
in the usual shell way. But I'd also expect such a bug to cause loads of
problems in all of the shell scripts. Are you sure it wasn't cmd.exe or
some other interpreter?
