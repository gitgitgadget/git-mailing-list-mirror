Yes, I think if it's tractable that's the best path forward. It's not
clear to me how many of the things valgrind reports are false positives
(and in what way). Certainly the lock_file patch I just posted seems
like something worth addressing, even if we _tend_ to only leak a small
number of such structs per program invocation. It's not a problem now,
but it's a sign of a bad pattern.
