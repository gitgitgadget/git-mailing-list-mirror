I think the logo should be a tortoise.  Why?  Because it's somewhat ironic.  
One of Linus' complaints about SCMs in-general and one of his praises of 
BitKeeper was performance/speed.  The tortoise is typified as being a slow 
and cumbersome animal.  Also, the hare, the tortoise' competition, is 
typified as being quick and possessing fecundity (things that you'd want to 
identify with "git"... and the job of any decent C programmer is to obfuscate 
meaning when possible J/K).  

Oh, and there's a picture of a tortoise named "git.gif"...

Perhaps not.  Hah
