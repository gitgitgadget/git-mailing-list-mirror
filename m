Thanks for thinking about this. In general, yeah, allowing "-1" as
"unlimited" is a sensible thing for many options. But for these two
variables, I don't think "unlimited" is ever a good idea:

  - for --window, it makes the amount of work quadratic in the number of
    objects in the repository (and likewise, memory usage equivalent to
    the uncompressed contents of the repo). Going beyond about 250 or so
    gives diminishing returns.

  - for --depth, going beyond about 50 provides diminishing space
    returns, and makes the run-time performance of accessing the deltas
    horrible.

So certainly INT_MAX or the max allowable by OE_DEPTH_BITS is a very bad
idea in both cases, and the use would probably be happier if we just hit
a die() instead. :) We _could_ make "-1" mean "the maximum sensible
valuable", but I think there's a lot of wiggle room for "sensible"
there. I much prefer using and advertising the actual values there (as
we do for "gc --aggressive").
