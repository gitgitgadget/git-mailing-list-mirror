I think you would get at lot less argument if you weren't so damn self
righteous about it.  If you'd just said "it's a matter of taste and
hard tabs 8 spaces wide are the way we prefer to do it and that's the
way we want to keep doing it" I'd not have any problem with it.

But when you start claiming that there are no reasons to use all
spaces, and that it doesn't solve any problems (it definitely does),
and that all editors work with hard tabs at 8 (which they don't), at
least I get a bit frustrated with you.  It's very non-respectful of you
to claim that everyone is stupid that doesn't agree with you and is
just asking for silly arguments.  Yes, I know, you're an opinionated
bastard and proud of it, but maybe you should tone that down a bit.

(At least I got quite insulted by your Git talk at Google. People
are not stupid just because they don't agree with you, most of the time
they just have different preferences or different goals.)
