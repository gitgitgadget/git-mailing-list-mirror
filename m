A wild bikeshed question: Is HEAD itself protected as a branch name e.g.
that HEAD could contain `ref: HEAD` or `ref: refs/heads/HEAD`? (or maybe
the nullÂ  oid

It sort of feels that we may already have some sort of protection for
the first self reference - i.e. exists, but not defined (self-reference).
