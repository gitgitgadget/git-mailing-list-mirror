Yeah, that makes sense. As Ã†var noted, we did write it such that people
passing in values would be unaffected. But we couldn't help anybody
_parsing_ the old format. This was a risk we accepted, because it's an
undocumented internal format.

So the "right" thing to do would be for the receiving side to pull the
value out with "git config" (which, presumably running the same version
of Git as the generating side, would do fine). I understand why a
program like git-cinnabar wouldn't want to make a bunch of awkward and
expensive git-config calls. But it's a problem that comes with using the
(also undocumented and not recommended) libgit.a as an interface.

So I am sad to have created headaches, but I also think it should not be
a far-reaching problem.

(I also wondered whether something like libgit2 or jgit might have been
parsing GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS, but neither seems to).
