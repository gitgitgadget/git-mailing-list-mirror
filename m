It would have been nice if you had said earlier on this list/thread
that Google chose to host a Gerrit user summit instead of the
traditional GitTogether.

Thanks for the information. I think it is indeed interesting to know about it.

Before I posted what you wrote on the Gerrit mailing list, the only
information people had on this list/thread was about a GitHub proposal
to organize 2 different GitTogether: "the developer-centric one in
Berlin
in early October (a few weeks before the Mentor Summit this time) and
the user one in January or February of next year."

Gerrit users/admins are probably Git users/admins too. But anyway, it
is ok of course for Google to organize whatever it prefers.
I hope GitHub will do as good a job running a GitTogether as Google did.

Thanks,
Christian.
