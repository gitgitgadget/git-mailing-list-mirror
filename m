Hello Marc, 

This is definitely not a spam message. We usually award some of the most popular
software we consider as being famous and we also download, install, test and
then write the following things for the awarded software:

- write a review focused on the "fame" reasons of that software;

- write a tutorial

- create few polls

- create few frequently asked questions

- write an article

- take a short online interview to the publisher, of course if that would be
possible.

All the things above are free of cost and we do them only for the software we
consider as being famous.

Thank you very much for your interest in our website.
