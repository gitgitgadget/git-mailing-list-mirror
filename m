Alrighty then.

I think I can deal with it on my own. But if you're
curious, it's right here:

https://github.com/a-random-lemurian/randstuff

Mostly random generators, like random ascii and hex.

> From experience I learned that, when talking about prejudice, it is better to shut up, pay attention to the conversations in the room and see who is being denied their humanity, who has the power in the situation and who is trying to prop up an emotional response from others. Most of the time, those who are being denied their humanity, those who are restrained in their response, those who have no power or say in the conversation and those who are more emotional than trying to prop emotions are the marginalized in the conversation.

Alrighty then. I'm also worried about prejudice in say,
machine learning. We humans are biased, so who's to say
the AI training data isn't biased?

In fact, I might be biased right now and I probably
would not realized it.


> Now, out of curiosity, are you named Lemuria because of Lemurs? You know, the little primates from the Madagascar island?

Indirectly. I named myself after the lost continent. It was a
decent name, which is why I use it as my psuedonym on most of
the internet.

And the lost continent in turn was named after... lemurs.
