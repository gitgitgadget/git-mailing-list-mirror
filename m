An interface requiring callers to allocate can be used to implement a
wrapper that does all allocations for them -- the other way around is
harder.  It can be used to avoid object duplication, but duplicates
functions.  No idea if that's worth it.

The xstrdup() here would have to go.

It would fit in with the rest of the API -- we have string_list_append()
as a wrapper for string_list_append_nodup()+xstrdup() already.  We also
have similar functions for strbuf and argv_array.  I find it a bit sad
to reimplement xstrfmt() yet again instead of using it directly, though.
