Nope. The culprit is

use lib (split(/:/, $ENV{GITPERLLIB} || "/Library/Perl/darwin"));

The latter, /Library/Perl/darwin comes from making "instlibdir" in perl/, 
which in turn is generated by "perl Makefile.PL". Calling the latter with 
PREFIX set does not change the output of "instlibdir" in any way.

This (from Makefile.PL) is already sufficient:

# We come with our own bundled Error.pm. It's not in the set of default
# Perl modules so install it if it's not available on the system yet.
eval { require Error };
if ($@) {
        $pm{'private-Error.pm'} = '$(INST_LIBDIR)/Error.pm';
}

What patience? Ah yes, I understand: irony.

Seriously, I still believe that proof-of-concepts in Bash or Perl or even 
Python are fine. But they are not for real work, so one of my long-term 
goals for git is to get rid of them.

Ciao,
