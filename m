I am against the feature as you describe it, because it has the
potential to break `git rebase --autosquash` with shared fixups if two
people are using a different prefix.

However, it sounds like Travis will recognize "[ci skip]" anywhere in
the commit message.  Would a feature to allow autogenerated content in
fixup/squash commit message bodies work?

In fact, this can already be achieved with a prepare-commit-msg hook
like this (untested, but shows the principle):

-- >8 --
#!/bin/sh
case "$(head -n 1 "$1")" in
"fixup! "*|"squash! "*)
	cat >>"$1" <<-\EOF

	[ci skip]
	EOF
esac
