Elsehwere in the thread, I responded to some feedback by suggesting
that perhaps I should flip it around, and instead add a 'refname'
sub-command, and have it default to 'refs/tags/{tagname}'

So the stream

    tag foo
    ...

would create a tag at "refs/tags/foo" that says "tag foo".  And the
stream

    tag bar
    refname refs/alternate-tags/baz

would create a tag at "refs/alternate-tags/baz" that says "tag bar".

Grepping for "refs/tags" in fast-export.c and fast-import.c, I think
that would fully address this concern.
