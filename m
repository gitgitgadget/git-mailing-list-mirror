I think this is _better_, but it's still kind of a funny interface.

The root of the matter is that the revision-walking code doesn't clean
up after itself. In every case, the caller is just saving these to clean
up commit marks, isn't it?

Could we instead have an interface like:

  revs.clear_commit_marks = 1;
  prepare_revision_walk(&revs);
  ...
  finish_revision_walk(&revs);

where that final function would do any cleanup, including clearing the
commit marks. I suspect there are other small bits that get leaked
because there's not really any "destructor" for a revision walk.

It's not as flexible as this whole "make a copy of the pending tips"
thing, but it keeps all of the details abstracted away from the callers.

Alternatively:

What if we just got rid of this function and had callers do:

  object_array_copy(&old_pending, &revs);
  prepare_revision_walk(&revs);
  ...
  clear_commit_marks_for_object_array(&old_pending);

That sidesteps all of the memory ownership issues by just creating a
copy. That's less efficient, but I'd be surprised if it matters in
practice (we tend to do one or two revisions per process, there don't
tend to be a lot of pending tips, and we're really just talking about
copying some pointers here).
