I've occasionally run into these failures on my local box, too. I'm
happy somebody is looking into it (I have before, but eventually threw
up my hands in disgust).

That's a reasonably clever solution. One thing I wonder, though: are we
always guaranteed that the log entries are written _at all_ before we
look at them?

I.e., could we have a situation where we make a request, the client
finishes, and then we look at the logs, but nothing has been written by
apache yet?

We could probably eliminate DST issues by consistently using UTC for the
timestamps. Leap seconds are probably infrequent enough not to worry
about. More likely is something like clock adjustment due to ntp. Those
adjustments are usually small enough not to matter, but if we're talking
microseconds, it could trigger.

What if the test script provides the in-order expectation, but we check
only the unordered version (by sorting both actual and expected output
on the fly)? That would give us a more relaxed check most of the time,
but somebody digging in to a failure could run the ordered diff (or we
could even show it automatically on failure instead of just using
test_cmp).

It's definitely bugged me. I'd be happy to see some solution. I've been
close to suggesting that reading apache logs is simply not robust, and
we should focus our tests on the git-visible state changes (e.g., seeing
successful requests, updated refs, etc).

A side effect of that is that it would become a lot easier to support
other webservers in our test scripts (though that may still be a fool's
errand just due to the amount of custom config we seem to carry).

I strongly suspect bitrotting. It looks like most of the "< 2.4"
directives are from 5 years ago (when Debian switched to 2.4 by
default), so even long-term stable systems would generally have it by
now (though I'm sure there's probably some RHEL version without it).
