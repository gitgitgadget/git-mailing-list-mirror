autodie has been around for a long time, but it only became part of the
perl core in v5.10.1 (according to Module::CoreList). I think the code
in perl/ requires only 5.8, but whenever we unconditionally use perl
without respect to NO_PERL (like in the test scripts), we usually shoot
for even antique versions of perl like 5.005.

So by those rules, we should avoid "autodie" here, though I wouldn't be
surprised if it takes a while for people to complain in practice (most
modern systems will have a recent enough perl, but it seems we go
through cycles where every few years somebody posts a bunch of patches
for ancient versions of IRIX or some other platform, cleaning up all of
these sorts of portability problems).
