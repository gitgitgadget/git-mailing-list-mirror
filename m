This all makes sense, and I think your fix is going in the right
direction.

But...

I also wonder about this. For refs, we already catch these cases at a
low-level and BUG(). That's better than a segfault, and I suspect we
should be doing the same here in oid_object_info_extended(). But that
just shifts the segfault to a BUG().

For the refs code, we've generally tried to catch things at a high-level
and report a more human-friendly error explaining the situation. So
doing the same thing here would mean adding code to ls-remote. But I
think the plumbing gets pretty tricky, since it has no way to ask
ref-filter "hey, are we doing to need to look at objects?".

That's a thing that I think ref-filter _should_ support (it knows it
after having parsed the format string). But it probably ought to come
along with other refactoring, and shouldn't hold up this fix.

So this probably _is_ a reasonable place to check it. However...

Would we perhaps want to give the user a hint that the object is not
really missing, but rather that we're not in a repository? E.g.,
something like:

  if (!have_git_dir())
	return strbuf_addf_ret(err, -1, "format specifier requires a repository");
  if (oid_object_info_extended(...))
	return ...;

?
