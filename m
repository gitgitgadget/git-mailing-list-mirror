I am currently facing some challenges in one of Linux subsystems where a rename
of a set of folders and files would be the perfect scenario for future
development, but the suggestion is not accepted, not because it's not correct,
but because it makes the maintainer life harder in backporting bug fixes and new
features to older kernel versions and because it is not easy to follow the
renamed file/folder history from the kernel.org history logs.

Like nature shows us, the ability to adapt is the key for survival, so Linux
would gain a lot with some new features in git that can make maintainers life
easier. Assisted-backporting would be an excellent feature for them.

Did you ever thought about optimization backport operations through git or by an
add-on to it?

I am available to help if this feature makes sense for git users.

Thanks,
Joao
