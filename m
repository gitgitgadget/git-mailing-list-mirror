I agree with this. I do think we should participate again, and I think
we should try to address the issues I brought up (and you mentioned
in your email) about project size and community involvement.

My email was meant to be a "maybe it's not too late if people really
want to work on the project ideas page". But I haven't seen anything
happening there, and we really are running right up to the deadline[1].
I think at this point it makes sense to wait a year and try to approach
it sooner next year.

[1] I know my email didn't give much time for action; the deadline snuck
    up on me, too.
