It looks to me an attempt to optimize (instead of starting from a
value that is too big to be minimum, pick the first value and start
from there, and all the "found even smaller one, so let's replace"
later would work the same way) that went wrong (just that the "first
one" was written incorrectly), but it is not absolutely necessary to
find out why the code was written in a particular way that happened
to be buggy.

Thanks for digging.

This nicely explains what goes wrong.

Yeah, if we really want to avoid INT_MAX we could use another "have
we found any value yet?" boolean variable, but the caller in
get_correspondences() does not even worry about integer overflows
when stuffing diffsize to the cost[] array, and the other possible
value that can go to cost[] array is COST_MAX that is mere 65k, so
it would be OK to use INT_MAX as sentinel here, I guess.
