Perhaps because you are actually wrong.

In the words of Tyrion Lannister: "Why do you want me to shut up? Am I
starting to make sense?"

Questioning our own ideas is the hallmark of a rational person.

You start the side-stepping the moment you say "I don't like your
tone", which is precisely why one should concentrate on the argument
being made, and not *how* it's being made. I'm not the only one that
things that way, read the extremely useful article from Paul
Graham[1].

It is you the one that is against concentrating on the technical
points of the discussion.

If you are suggesting punitive measures, let me remind you that any
modern society follows principles established in the Magna Carta eight
hundred years ago. Before being punished by the state, every person
has the right to a speedy trial, and the trial of course has to be
based on *the written law*.

If we don't have by-laws, you cannot be blamed to have violated them,
and you are even against guidelines, so on what basis are you going to
determine that somebody has acted in an illicit way? The opinion of a
single dictator? Mob rule?

It doesn't matter how you cut it, that would not be the rule of
law[2], a concept that has been in the civilized world even longer,
for thousands of years.
