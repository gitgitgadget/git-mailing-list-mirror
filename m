Not entirely useless though. It serves as an indication of who to
contact for permission to copy. It's not as good as it should be
("which of the 35 L.Torvalds in the phonebook does this mean?").
Copyright law reform proponents do sometimes talk of a central
database with contact details for copyright owners and other measures
to facilitate brokerage of licenses.

It also serves as a reminder of the need for a license, though legally
it's not required. Just like a lock in the door, while often easy to
pick or crack open and definitely not required, reminds people that
trespassing is a crime.

Bah, social mores, laws and other vices of humanity...
