I don't know either.  Maybe it seems a bit early still considering the
numbers we have: 

   $ git grep -l PASSES_SANITIZE_LEAK=true t/t[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]-*.sh | wc -l
   678
   $ git grep -L PASSES_SANITIZE_LEAK=true t/t[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]-*.sh | wc -l
   329

BTW, perhaps we want to do this:

Subject: [PATCH] t: do not mark tests as no-leak-free

The mark TEST_PASSES_SANITIZE_LEAK=false and the absence of it mean the
same thing: the test triggers leaks.  However, explicitly declaring that
the test leak, with TEST_PASSES_SANITIZE_LEAK=false, can suggest there
is some special consideration for it, which is not the case.

Looking back at the history of the tests we're modifying in this patch,
we see that both were marked as "leak-free", but later started
triggering leaks and had to be re-marked accordingly as "no-leak-free".
Instead of removing the mark entirely, it was changed to "false".

It doesn't seem to have much historical value to keep the mark for this
reason, and removing it reduces the confusion that it has some special
meaning.

Do it so.
