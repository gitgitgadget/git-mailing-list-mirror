I think these are two separate questions. In my case the first is
(swiss) german, the second is english. I don't like localized software
too much, I always have to think what a certain german term might mean
in english to understand computing-specific texts.

That being said I think that the first question is irrelevant for the
git survey. Maybe we should use the term 'internationalization' or
'localization' somewhere to make clear what we are talking about. While
these terms might scare newbies away we can reasonably expect that they
are known by git users.
