Anybody who wants to refer to a file or memory size would want that. We
have a few cases in pack-objects already, but they use OPT_MAGNITUDE()
instead. Which makes sense. Anything we expect to be that gigantic would
want to have the shorthand to say "4G" or whatever.

(As a side note, I notice that OPT_MAGNITUDE uses "unsigned long", which
probably needs to be adjusted for Windows. Dealing with all of the
void-pointer type-punning fallout from that will be fun. :) ).

Looks like this found a lot of the same issues my "intp" conversion
found. My recollection is that mine found more, but it might just have
been that the compiler's warning output is rather verbose. TBH, I didn't
carefully catalog them; as soon as I saw the problem, I went to bed in
disgust. ;)

I avoided relying on the python interpreter for previous cocci patches,
since some builds don't have it (IIRC, the one in Debian experimental
doesn't, but that one has not graduated even to "unstable" after several
years, so maybe it's not worth worrying about).

If we do start using python, we might want to revisit 4d168e742a
(coccinelle: use <...> for function exclusion, 2018-08-28), which
describes a faster python alternative in the commit message.
