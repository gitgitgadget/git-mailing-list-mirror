Of course, I would be fine if this list here would be simply defined as
the "git development centric list" and a new, more usage-centric list
could be started (git-users ?).

I wouldn't consider myself a complete newbie (given my DVCS knowledge I
already have from my involvement in the Mercurial and TortoiseHg
projects -- I contributed code to both of them).

I was just interested in using git, not (yet) developing. This includes
also advanced uses and problems advanced users may have with git
(helping me to get a better understanding of git).
