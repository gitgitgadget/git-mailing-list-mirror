I think it depends on how you define "anonymous". I don't know
gitzilla's legal name, and nor do I care. But I have seen the reputation
he or she has established through postings on the git list over the past
few years, and that gives the statement non-zero value.

And I don't know who _you_ are, even though you are presumably using
your real name (probably because this message is cross-posted, and you
have some reputation on users@kernel.org, with which I am not familiar).
