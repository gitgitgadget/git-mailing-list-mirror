Hello there, I sent you an email yesterday with a proposal that I think is going to be of mutual benefit but I did not receive a response from you yet so I am sending you this follow up to confirm if you actually received my email yesterday.

Please let me know if you did not receive my proposal so that I can resend it to you. Use the email below to contact me.

Regards,
Dean
