You left out this part of my commit message:

"In practice, I've only encountered this issue when rebasing commits
that were generated by git svn."

Which is exactly what I was doing. I'm rebasing commits from this repo:

http://src.chromium.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=3Dchromium.git

The rebase operation is munging the address and transforming an author =
of

  user@chromium.org <user@chromium.org@0039d316-1c4b-4281-b951-d872f208=
7c98>

into

  user@chromium.org <user@chromium.org>

Regardless of whether the address is valid or not, rebase shouldn't mun=
ge it.
