Yep, exactly. I really wish we could use typeof(); there are a couple
things that could be made less error-prone and ugly. But it's not even a
matter of C99; it's a GNU-ism, so I don't think we are even close to
having support for it everywhere.

Oh, I think it's worth keeping forever, if only because it makes the
macro interface have one fewer gotcha. Spending a line of code on that
is OK with me.

Looks good. Thanks for following up.
