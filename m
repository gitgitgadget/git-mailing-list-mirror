There is a `contrib/rerere-train.sh` script in git's repository,
that can recreate rerere resolutions from existing merge commits.

Extending the options Eric outlined, a collaborative conflict
resolution workflow might thus be:

  * developers do test merges on temporary branches between their
    feature branch and the main development â€“ or other feature
    branches if necessary (maybe create test merges on a regular
    basis to minimize the new conflicts)
  * these temporary branches get pushed, but not merged to other
    branches
  * the branch manager fetches these branches and uses
    `rerere-train.sh` to fill the local rerere database with
    conflict resolutions from the test merges
  * the temporary branches get deleted
  * the recorded resolutions get reused when needed (keep in mind
    rerere's gc config, see gc.rerereResolved and gc.rerereUnresolved)

The last discussion on rerere-train.sh on this list was here:
