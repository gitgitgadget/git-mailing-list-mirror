Thank you so much for the careful review of the series.

That's unexpected - I wrote the commands within single quotes in the pull
request. Since backticks are rendered as "code-tags" on Github, let me 
try single quotes.

I think that's useful context for someone wondering whether we continue
to take the performance hit with topological levels or have abandoned
topological levels or chosen some another alternative altogether.

Yes. The plaintext in pull request description reads as follows:

  Thus, the need for generation number v2 was born. New generation number
  needed to provide good performance, increment updates, and backward
  compatibility. Due to an unfortunate problem [1], we also needed a way
  to distinguish between the old and new generation number without
  incrementing graph version.

  [1]: https://public-inbox.org/git/87a7gdspo4.fsf@evledraar.gmail.com/

I have been reviewing other pull request descriptions to match their
style (and hope the cover letter renders correctly) and Dr. Stolee in
his patch series to "add --literal value" option to configuration has
written:
  
  As reported [1], 'git maintenance unregister' fails when a repository
  is located in a directory with regex glob characters.

I think it is better to indicate the rareness of overflows.

Since the improvement can be applied to both 
`write_graph_chunk_generation_data_overflow()` and 
`write_graph_chunk_extra_edges()`, I am planning to cover this in a
followup.
