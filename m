You can set a different default remote for "git pull" for each branch by 
setting an upstream branch with "git branch --set-upstream-to" which 
sets "branch.<name>.remote" and "branch.<name>.merge" or 
"branch.<name>.rebase". You can also set a different remote to push to 
by setting "branch.<name>.pushRemote" - see the "git config" 
documentation. Would that help?

Best Wishes

Phillip
