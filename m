I'll take you on that when announcing start of "Git User's Survey 2009"=

I think that this year I would leave project's mailing list alone

Last year I contacted Petr Baudis about putting announcement on=20
repo.or.cz, IIRC J.H. 'Warthog9' about git.kernel.org, and appropriate
admins for GitHub and Gitorious.  Last year Sourceforge didn't have,
I think, support for git; do you know who to contact about putting
announcement there?  I tried also to contact Assembla and Unfuddle,
without success.

I can try again to contact LWN.net; what other places we can put
announcement?
