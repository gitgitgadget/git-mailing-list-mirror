That's the normal response from tech-savvy people. They usually dislike
translations because they think it cannot convey the same ideas as the
original.

However, for a lot of less techy people, having to use software and
read documentation in a non-native language *is* a big hurdle for using
computers. That is especially true when it comes to complex software,
such as Git.

I would very much like to see the core git commands translated. The
command-line svn client already talks Swedish to me (cvs does not,
though), and I would be very happy to teach git the same. I already did
translate git-gui and gitk, which was as much for my own benefit as
others.
