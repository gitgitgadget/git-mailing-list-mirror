What you explained was the reason I mentioned that. Because some users 
were wrongfully trying to remove decorations by trying to exclude the 
starting points. But I agree this adds little value and can generate 
further confusion. I will remove that section.

That's a nice explanation that fits the current "--decorate-refs" behavior.

I wanted to allow exact patterns like:
"--decorate-refs=refs/heads/master" and for that I disabled the flag 
that adds the trailing '/*' if no globs are found. As a side effect, I 
lost the shortcut.

Is adding a yet another flag that appends '/*' only if the pattern 
equals "refs/{heads,remotes,tags}" a good idea?

Because changing the default behavior of that function has implications 
on multiple commands which I think shouldn't change. But at the same 
time, would be nice to have the logic that deals with glob-ref patterns 
all in one place.

What's the sane way to do this?

I believe the same explanation mentioned earlier fits nicely here too.

This would be what a sane person would do. This detail went over my 
head. Will move it to load_ref_decorations()

I will make the corrections. Thanks for the feedback.
