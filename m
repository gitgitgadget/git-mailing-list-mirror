Yes, Brian, what you're sharing makes total sense when things are setup
this way, but this is not the case with the project I'm contributing to.
This one is setup, commit first, review later, due to having too few hands.

And I have already setup a CI to detect misconfigured systems. It'll
catch RPs in time, and everything else post-commit. Let's hope the
developers will watch the status of their commits and will react quickly
to fix their setup and mend the broken commit, when they see their
commit broke things. That's as good as it can get in this particular
situation I understand.

Thank you, Brian and Ã†var for your support and very helpful suggestions.
