You can contact GitHub support. The usual procedure is:

  1. Find out if rewriting is an option (i.e., if the history isn't
     already widely published), and walk the user through cleaning up
     the history if that's an option.

  2. For established history, we'll sometimes relax the fsck checks
     temporarily to allow it to be pushed (it depends on the exact
     failing check, but this one is mostly cosmetic and would be OK).
