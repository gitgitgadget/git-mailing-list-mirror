Very cute.  I actually like it.  Maybe I'll take a stab at creating
a git-gui icon, because like you I also cannot draw.  A feather
and some pluses and minuses can't be that hard, can it?  :)

Actually I just need to find a two year old.  Any two year old with
crayons can draw many times better than I ever could.  However I
think the difficult part is to get the two year old to draw the
subject matter...
