Yup.

Hmm.  I am puzzled.  Are you suggesting to change behaviour of
"git apply" with --index?

git generated patch, or patches on the kernel list that are not
generated with git are always relative to the top-level, so I
think the current --index behaviour makes tons of sense.

I think it boils down to this question: when you have a patch on
hand that you are considering to apply to your tree, if the
patch talks about just "Makefile" (e.g. it says "a/Makefile
b/Makefile") which Makefile is more likely to be what the patch
is talking about -- the toplevel one or the one in the
subdirectory you happen to be in?

Both (1) diff generated by git are always relative to top, and
(2) the BCP on the kernel list (and I suspect many other
projects are run this way as well) is to have diff relative to
the toplevel, suggests that "a/Makefile b/Makefile" patch is
much more likely to be about the top-level Makefile no matter
where you happen to be.

Although the fact you *are* in the subdirectory when you are
considering that patch makes it a bit more plausible than
otherwise that the patch may be about sub/directory/Makefile, I
do not think that is strong enough hint to make it more
plausible to apply to the sub/directory one than to the
toplevel.

If the patch were what you made by running "GNU diff" inside a
corresponding subdirectory of another repository (perhaps you
wanted to feed uncommitted changes from there to this
repository), then you can always use "GNU patch" to apply.  If
you made such a one-shot patch using git-diff, it will tell you
the correct directory to apply to, so...
