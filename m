NHK are the public broadcaster in Japan, and Domo-kun is their mascot.
Apparently the NHK spots with Domo-kun are also used in the US on
Nickelodeon. It's like the NBC peacock, or the BBC test card girl:
instantly recognizable to anyone who watched that channel.

And yes, there is a US trademark:
http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&state=3pcqf.6.1

No connection to NHK at all, but I thought you'd used Domo
deliberately when I first saw that logo, so got curious. The site is
great, btw.

Cheers,
Baz
