I think the problem with this is that git tells the user so little
information, ("may lose your changes"). What changes? Is that dirty
state?  Some commits? Hmm... have I committed anything? Why can't git
be sure about what this operation is going to do?

I think a really useful message would be something like:

	You are not on any branch so switching to branch 'foo'
	will cause the following commits to be lost:

		ba531642 A commit headline here...
		b1189118 Another commit headline here...

	Refusing to checkout 'foo'.

Didn't a bunch of work get committed to make the reachability analysis
feasible to generate a message like this?

If there are no commits that would become dangling, then the checkout
should just proceed. As for the concern about losing a pointer to some
"valuable" state that will still technically be reachable, but might
be hard to get back, why not just print a message along the lines of:

	Leaving commit 7b1509f4 to checkout 'foo'.

(or just depend on the HEAD reflog).

-Carl

PS. If nothing else gets changed in the current message, please
reconsider the current wording of:

	Leaving your HEAD detached; not switching to branch 'foo'.

Think: Wow, I had heard that git might help me shoot myself in the
foot, but I never though I might behead myself with it.

It would probably work to just reword that as:

	Not switching to branch 'foo'.
