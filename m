Push is/should be 'update all', fetch is/should be 'fetch any'.
I thought that multiple remote.<name>.url values provide this
fallback for fetch, but it looks like it isn't so...

One would need to configure fallback B remote to use the same
remote-branch namespace as remote A, if it is to be used as fallback,
I would think.

Nb. there is also http-alternates mechanism... which nowadays doesn't
matter anyway, I would think.
