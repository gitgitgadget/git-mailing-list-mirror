I guess it's not exactly clear to me what the difference is between
the "official logo" debate and what you're asking.

I think that the problem with this entire thread is that there is no
such logo that is understood to be Git (i.e., that you could ask
people out of context what the Git logo looks like and they'd be able
to remember without being tainted). If you want proof of that take
that logo from git-scm.com, remove the word "git", and show it to a
random sampling of people in the tech. community and ask them if they
recognize it. I know that I wouldn't (like many others I had to
request http://git-scm.com/ to check what it even was), despite being
a long time Git user and relatively active community member (mostly in
IRC). I suspect that most Git users wouldn't be able to identify it.

I don't particularly like it the logo on git-scm.com[1], and I think
that several good points have been raised here about its weaknesses
and lack of any real strengths. I'm not sure that my say is worth
much, but I'd be in favor of using the one that spells out git (the
one in the top left of the wiki[2]) over the one with the nonsensical
commit nodes[1]. :) Or even take the idea from the wiki and tidy it up
a bit. I think it's a clever idea that works well with the name and we
shouldn't throw it away. Or even take the other and resolve the
problems raised above (the color is secondary, but the logical
structure of the repository is pretty universally backwards).

I wouldn't really be in favor of us encouraging the use of [1], but if
we do it's not the end of the world either. I don't think it's
particularly good so the question is do we and should we care if the
project becomes known by an ambiguous, flawed (apologies to the
designer) logo?

I'm not even sure that I'd agree that Git needs "marketing" at all.
That sounds like a gimmick to maximize "market share" instead of solve
a problem well and I think it belongs more in the rivals' camps. ;) I
think this project should continue to focus on being better instead of
being presented better.
