It depends a lot what part of git you would like to work on.
Do you find one of the proposed subject interesting?
If yes, tell us and the relevant people will probably tell you what
you could start with.

And by the way the same question has been asked recently and the
answer was to search a mailing list archive for "low hanging fruit" as
we don't use any bug tracker.
You could perhaps search the source code for "TODO" or "NEEDS WORK" too.

I hope you will have more time during the summer otherwise it might
not be enough for the GSOC.

Thanks,
Christian.
