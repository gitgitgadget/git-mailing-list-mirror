As a matter of fact, this mailing list is the only correct place to ask
questions like yours.  But this is free software after all -- people
who could answer your question may be busy/absent at the moment or even
not involved in the project anymore (in the worst case).  So be
prepared to wait some time.  Also be prepared for your particular
trouble not being solved.

In the meantime, I think Thomas provided you with valuable suggestions
in reply to your mirror post on git-users, so you could possibly
explore them.
