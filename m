No, it does not.  It depends on a few of external libraries (and
software packages) -- check it out yourself at [1].

It should be noted though that this list is not fixed.
IIUC the only hard dependency is zlib and all the other stuff is
optional.  SSH transport is implemented by calling an OpenSSH (or
compatible) client program, so this is a soft dependency.

Note that in your case you will need to have Perl 5.8+ because it's
used by the git-svn implementation, and that will use the Perl bindings
for Subversion (which, in turn, depend on both Perl and libsvn).
You'll need to have that stuff available and installed as well.

It's hard to tell.

RH 5.5 appears to be really really old so it's unlikely you'll find
official RPMs for recent Git versions.  You might try to look them up
in unofficial 3rd-party repos maintained by those who need to support
outdated systems.

This might get further complicated by the fact you appear to have
non-standard Subversion package (too fresh for RH 5.5 IMO).

Failing that, I'd have a VM running RH 5.5 and tried to build a set of
RPMs against the software packages you have deployed on the target
system.  The RPM specs can be grabbed from any up-to-date Redhatoid
system and backported.
