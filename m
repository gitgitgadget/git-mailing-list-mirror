Looks like you picked up this patch on a topic branch

I was thinking of polishing it further with a test, but I can't think of
a good way to do one that would not be horribly racy. I even tried to
think of a racy test I could run manually (e.g., pushing and killing in
a loop) but even that is tough (even with the patch, it's racy whether
the push will succeed or not, depending on exactly when you kill the
parent, so there's no automatic way to distinguish the improved cases).

So I think it is still a good idea to do, and what I wrote earlier is
as good a we can do.

Ren√©, do you want to wrap up your similar patch for the fetch side?
