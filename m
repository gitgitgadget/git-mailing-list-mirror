It might have raised Junio's eyebrows less to say something like:

   ...convert the existing strbuf_release() calls as well (they're not
   wrong, but they also accomplish nothing and create an inconsistency
   with the UNLEAKed variables).

That aside, the patch looks good.

Seeing hunks like this makes me happy with the UNLEAK() solution. It
would have been a real pain to do this via actual freeing.
