Konstantin,

My goal is to establish partnership relations with Git because some of 
Devart's products support Git version control system (for example dbForge 
Studio for SQL Server https://www.devart.com/dbforge/sql/studio/).
My team and I would be glad to come up with cross-marketing activities 
between Devart and Git. We think that some users of our development products 
would be interested to switch to Git version control system.

Best regards
Nikita Malikov
