Heh. That's exactly my process, too. :)

Yeah, especially because as a concept it exists outside of the script
itself (i.e., you have to checkout a failing version and then run the
script a bunch of times; that's not something that test-lib.sh should
even know about).

So let's go with this for now. It's already a much nicer tool than we
had yesterday, so we can take some time to get used to it.
