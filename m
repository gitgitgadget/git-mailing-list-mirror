Yeah, that's what I figured. I actually queued quite a few of these
-Wunused-parameter fixups, because the initial iterations of merge-ort
had a lot of stub functions or unimplemented bits. I sat on them for a
year or so because I figured you'd eventually use those parameters. And
indeed, most of them fell out naturally, and what was left for this
series was all pretty easy to understand.
