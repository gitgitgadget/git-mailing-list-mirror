Dear Author,

You can upload your invited paper for our conferences in Salerno, Italy, June 27-29, 2015: www. wseas. org until June 7, 2015

(by the way, you can also upload your papers for our conferences in Zakynthos Island, Greece until June 30, 2015)

As you remember we had invited you as Invited Speaker in these conferences with publication of the extended version of your paper in our ISI/SCI Journals (with Impact Factor from Thomson Reuters).
 
The Papers of our Guest Speakers will be published in our Books, Proceedings and E-Library as well as their extended version in one of our 44 collaborating ISI Journals. The last one is an important feature of our conferences and for this reason our conferences are more and more popular (see photos in our web site).

All the papers from our previous conferences (since March 2014) have been indexed in ISI  as well as in many other major indexes via conference proceedings and/or our 44 ISI journals.

Do not send your invited papers by email. Just upload them via www. wseas. org selecting the most appropriate conference
with the indication (in the Field "notes") INVITED-by-ANNA-PAPADIMITRIOU
The invited papers are a small percent and are noted in the conference program as Invited papers with 30 minutes' presentation instead of 20 minutes' presentation of the regular papers.
You could also organize a special session with a minimum of 6 papers.
Special Session organizers participate free in the conference provided that their session will have at least 5 fully registered papers. In this case, they are also honored as Editors in the Books and Proceedings and as Plenary Speakers.

Salerno (Italy):  Salerno is one of the most beautiful town of Italy in Mediterranean Sea. The main town is close to the Amalfi Coast, and is mostly known for its Schola Medica Salernitana, the first medical school in the world. In the 16th century, under the Sanseverino family, among the most powerful feudal lords in Southern Italy, the city became a great centre of learning, culture and the arts, and the family hired several of the greatest intellectuals of the time. In recent history the city hosted the King of Italy, who moved from Rome in 1943 after Italy negotiated a peace with the Allies in World War II. Today Salerno is an important cultural centre in Campania and Italy and has had a long and eventful history. The city has a rich and varied culture, and the city is divided into thr
 ee distinct regions: the medieval sector with a modern state-of-the arts area, the planned 19th
century district and the more densely populated post-war area, with its several apartment blocks. There is easy transportation by aeroplane and train. The University of Salerno supports and sponsors all these conferences. Wikipedia: Salerno
