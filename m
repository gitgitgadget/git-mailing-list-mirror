Heh. Yeah, I would call that _more_ hackery in that it's much more
clever. But it is shorter. :)

I think as long as the trickery is documented that's OK (and calling it
doesnt_matter and explaining in the commit message is fine by me;
hopefully that name would induce somebody to look in the history).

Yes, I think the test can and should check the after-gc state.
