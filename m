What you're missing is this part:

    git branch -m topic

I.e. we clone the repo, and have a "master" branch, we then rename
"master" to "topic", now there's no local master branch. Then we
checkout master either with only one remote or two.

Thanks, will fix.

I thought about this use-case, and if we want this in the future I think
the most straightforward way is not to invent some new search order
variable, but just make use of git config allowing multi-values, i.e.:

    [checkout]
        defaultRemote = origin
        defaultRemote = gitster

Although I'm not interested in implementing that now, and unlike just
having one special remote I don't think it's of interest to the vast
majority of git users.
