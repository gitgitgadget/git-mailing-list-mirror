Note that this feature is especially useful if startup time is long,
that is if you are using an operating system with costly fork / new process
startup time like MS Windows (which you have mentioned), or writing
filter in a programming language with large startup time like Java
or Python (the latter may have changed since).

Actually, I think I have misunderstood your intent.  If you want to have
simpler protocol, with only one place to signal errors, that is after
sending a response, then proper way of signaling the error condition
would be to send empty file and then "reject" instead of "success":

   packet:          git< size=0\n    (omitted with capability "stream")
   packet:          git< 0000        (we need this flush packet)
   packet:          git< reject\n

Otherwise in the case without size upfront (capability "stream")
file with contents "reject" would be mistaken for the "reject" packet.

See below for proposal with two places to signal errors: before sending
first byte, and after.


NOTE: there is a bit of mixed and possibly confusing notation, that
is 0000 is flush packet, not packet with 0000 as content.  Perhaps
write pkt-line in full?

Wouldn't it be better for easier review to split it into separate patches?
Perhaps at least the new test...
