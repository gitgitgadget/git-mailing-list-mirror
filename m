Ah, yeah. I didn't look to see if there were existing cases of the same
thing.

I could go either way on this kind of saved_errno thing in general (the
tr2 functions called in between are really quite unlikely to set errno
(I am not even sure if getenv() and atoi() can, so this really might
just be future-proofing in case those tr2 functions get more
complicated).

But seeing that there are other cases of the same, I definitely think it
is not something that should be in Ã†var's patch. It is a cleanup we
could do on top if we cared to.
