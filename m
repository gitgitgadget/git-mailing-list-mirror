The n versus c issue is IMHO separate. Maybe tiny overlaps.

I see it mostly in the light of -c should be for "copy".

On "git checkout" it is "-b" for branch. That works, if you perceive 
"branch" as a verb. "The action of branching creates a new branch".

If needs must, that would work as "git switch -b" to.

Actually, "new" or "create" would make sense in "git branch". But in git 
switch, they actually raise the question "create what?" / "new what?".

Well, that is the question as what the action is perceived.
I think the example is wrong, rather than the command.

-c / -C /-n / -N always *c*reate an *n*ew branch. (create and new really 
are the same thing here)

But if the branch name Foo, is already used?
Well, it will still be a *new* branch being *created*.
To do that it has to remove the name from the old branch. (effectively 
removing the old branch).

Well ok, if you shorten it to one word that solves it too.
But for anything that for some reason needs two words, IMHO there should 
be one style. "one word", "-" or "_".
Currently different styles are mixed.

Nope it does not go away.

All this has done, is that it no longer is a "force" command.
So the last bit of warning has just gone.

And it still needs to be documented inside the "git switch" doc, rather 
than forwarding the user do yet another doc.

Also making the user read the "git reset" doc does not help, unless we 
point out that this is a --hard reset, rather than "modifying the index".

I would on that account argue that "git reset --hard/mixed/soft" should 
be "force" commands.

And the "git reset" documentation, as well as "git branch -f" / git 
checkout -B", also miss the information why they are "force".
It is true, this information can be derived, if one
- knows the concepts (which one should do)
- and actually connects the dots (humans do have a tendency to overlook 
things, especially if they are only indirectly referred to)

So, I still ask:
- If "--force" to overwrite the work tree can clearly state that change 
to files will be "thrown away".
- Then why can "force" re-using an existing branch name not do the same?

And that is the same, never mind if we call it -C, -B or --reset.
