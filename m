(Presenter: Taylor Blau, Notetaker: Keanen Wold)

* Software Freedom Conservancy status report
* We have about $89k in the Git project account (up ~$20k from last year)
   * Biggest expense is Heroku - Fusion has been covering the bill
      * There's on and off work on porting from a Rails app to a static site:
        https://github.com/git/git-scm.com/issues/942
   * Dan Moore from FusionAuth has been providing donations
   * Ideally we are able to move away from using Heroku, but in the meantime
     we'll have coverage either from (a) FusionAuth, or (b) Heroku's new
     open-source credit system
* We have more money than we have plans for, we're looking for ideas[a] on how
  to spend this money such as funding people to visit our conferences and
  sponsoring students to learn more about Git
* Trademark considerations for people using "Git" in their product names
   * We do have general council and are trying to think more about what the Git
     trademark means
   * Question - are there other conservancy products who have trademark issues
      * They hold all trademarks for their projects
      * Git has had the most problems with people/products using Git in their
        name
      * They reach out with letters, etc. and have not had to take legal action
        in most cases
   * Question - how do we enforce the rules when we have GitHub and GitLab?
      * The trademark has exemptions for Hub and Lab
      * We need to hold the line for the trademark for new companies, etc. using
        the name otherwise we lose our leverage to protect the name
   * Question - have the trademark â€˜offenses' been growing?
      * It's been pretty stable
      * We're looking to be fair
   * Additional questions can be sent to Pono
