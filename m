I am not aware of any distribution (Linux, g4w, Mac) shipping anything 
except the git-gui in Junio's tree, which is specific to the git-core 
version, and the git-gui packages require (or are a part of) the same 
version git-core package: no cross-version compatibility of git 
components is assumed. Certainly, folks rolling their own can pull from 
upstream git-gui, but they take the risk of incompatibility with an 
outdated git. Other tools in Junio's tree have already made the switch 
to git-hook (send-email, git-p4) even though they are usually packaged 
separately from git-core, but also version locked to matching git-core.

Updating git-gui's hook execution to match git internals would be more 
complex than what I implemented or what was there before.Â  For instance, 
I never looked at what git-hook's g4w compatibility code uses to test if 
a hook is present and executable, it wouldn't surprise me to find 
git-gui was missing something there, but who wants to bother? Also, the 
commit language surrounding addition of git-hook is strongly suggestive 
of other changes in configuration coming, meaning more changes to hook 
execution code would be needed that are avoided by using git-hook. Note: 
I have one more patch to send, removing yet another work-around for 
early Cygwin tcl/tk, as more evidence of how many years it takes to 
clean some of this stuff out and the difficulty of keeping git-gui up to 
date.

I had considered the above when creating the patch, and I believe what I 
did is the right approach.

Mark
