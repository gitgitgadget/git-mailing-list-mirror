The rename detection feature is nice and we'd like to leave it on 
whenever possible.  The performance issues only occur when in the middle 
of a merge - normal status commands behave reasonably.  As a result, we 
don't want to just turn it off completely by setting diff.renames.

Until we come up with a more elegant solution, we currently turn it off 
completely for merge via the new merge settings and then intercept calls 
to status and if there is a MERGE_HEAD we turn it off for status just 
for that specific call.  I view this as a temporary solution so would 
not want to put that logic into git proper as it is quite specific to 
when running git on a virtualized repo.

I agree that they should behave as similar as possible which is why all 
the new settings default to the diff setting when not explicitly set.  I 
believe this is a good model - if you don't do anything special you get 
the default/same behavior but if you know and need special behavior, you 
now have that option.

I agree that it is unfortunate that diff/merge/status all parse and deal 
with config settings differently.  I'd be happy to see someone tackle 
that and move the code to a single, coherent model but that is beyond 
the scope of this patch.

I debated that as well but given the logic is so simple, opted to stick 
with this.  I also debated whether it would be clearer in the form:

if (s->detect_rename >= 0)
	rev.diffopt.detect_rename = s->detect_rename;

But decided git contributes are used to seeing dense code :) and this 
style better matched what I saw in the merge settings.
