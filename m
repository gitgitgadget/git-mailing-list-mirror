I don't know. Hpa did an announcement when kernel.org switched to 0.99.4, 
but I never saw any announcement of upgrades (I only noticed that the date 
on /usr/bin/git is now Sep 7 a coupld of days ago - no proof of upgrade, 
but _something_ happened six days ago ;)

I personally run my own private set of binaries anyway, and I upgrade 
pretty randomly, so what the official kernel.org installation is doesnt' 
affect me personally ;)
