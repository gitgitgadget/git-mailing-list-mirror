Yeah, I think this is the key thing. We can afford to be a bit more
aggressive with the doc toolchain requirements in general because
there's an easy fallback.

(Though I think even without that, it sounds like this version is pretty
safe, and the proposed change would not even break the old versions, but
keep them with the same behavior).

The overall proposal sounds like a good idea to me, as long as the
review comments I saw elsewhere.
