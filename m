When you want to start a new Planet and make it successful, it may not be a bad idea to prime it by adding feeds from well known people near the center of the git universe, and it would have been better if it was done even before going public like this announcement.

You may have to research whose writings are worth including (http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/GitLinks has a few pointers), and you need to probably go to them and ask permission for including their feeds.  In other words, I think you should spend some effort on your own, not just setting up a site and throwing a URL to the wild, to make your Planet successful.
