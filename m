You're right that this is confusing. Seems worth a comment.

When we have a commit-graph with computed generation numbers, the 
generation number for a commit is exactly one more than the maximum 
generation number of its parents EXCEPT in the case that we would have a 
generation number too large to store in the commit-graph. In this case 
(that is not currently possible with any repo in existence) we "squash" 
the generation number at GENERATION_NUMBER_MAX, so we have equality 
between the generation at the commit and the generation of a parent.

I appreciate the level of inspection you are giving this series!

Yeah, this is a bit of a mess. The arithmetic to get these numbers is 
not hard, so I could do that math in the script (at run time instead of 
at dev time).

I also realize that the way I write the commit-graph to be "fixed" 
before these tests is not so fixed: if a new ref is added, then the 
tests break. I'll update the commit-graph to be reachable from commits/8 
so we have a more concrete example:

git rev-parse commits/8 | git commit-graph write --stdin-commits

(This already changes the written commit-graph because of the 'git pull' 
test, so it will "help" me be sure my math is correct when recomputing 
the new offsets for the corruption tests.)

Thanks,
