I think this weather-balloon patch adds the missing info at the most
natural place in the flow of the document.  An earlier part talks
about a GitWeb URL having <repo>, <action>, <revision>, <path> and
followed by what is called <arguments> after a question mark '?',
but what <arguments> part means and how to formulate it are left
unsaid.

By the way, the title of the section 'Actions, and URLs' needs to
lose the comma, I would think.

Until this point, the reader hasn't even been told about "filename"
is one of the potential things that can be given to "control the
behaviour of the action", and is left wondering if she has a
filename that does not have double-dots, how it can be passed "in
path part of URL" after reading the first sentence.  Then the second
sentence adds more to the mystery by starting with "All parameters
that cannot be passed" "in that way": what are the possible things
that the users may want to pass?  what exactly is "in that way",
which probably means "encoded as part of the <path>", but it is
unclear how that encoding works (is it just to "concatenate"?).

Or is "filename in the revision" the ONLY thing the above paragraph
talks about, and is the ONLY purpose of the "<path> part" to
represent that "filename in the revision" in the URL?

    .../gitweb.cgi/<repo>/<action>/<revision>:/<path>?<arguments>

The above syntax (taken from the first paragraph of the section)
suggests that <path> cannot be used to hold filename with a colon,
too.  Perhaps "for example if a filename contains double-dots" needs
to become an exhaustive description somewhere, i.e. "(see below for
the exact rules)" added to that sentence?

There is no mention of "filename" or "path" here, which further
confuses a reader who was told in the first paragraph that these
query-parameters are used when <path> part cannot hold a certain
filename.  Also it is unclear if <revision> corresponds to 'h'ash
in the above.
