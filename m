I think it will actually encourage them to edit the file (and complain
of a regression), since they can see the credential is correct, but
somehow git fails to work with it unlike their previous version.

remember there is no warning that could explain why that happens and
with this pach there is no error either.

I was going to say Jonathan will have to do it, since he was the only one
that didn't provide a patch (and therefore a sign off) but guess I can
save everyone some time and practice my git-send-email skills (which 
obviously failed me)

Jonathan,

make sure your patch[1] is complete and correct and to resend it with
a sign off, feel free to add me as Tested-by if you feel like, but I
added myself as Helped-by anyway ;)

Junio,

didn't fix the typo that Peff suggested fixed[2], because I forgot
and I wasn't sure if that also means I should SOB it, but if you
could also consider my suggestion[3] then at you get my SOB warranted ;)

Carlo

PS. guess I should had send it as an RFC instead
