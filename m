Yeah, exactly. I think it should end up quite fast, though if anybody
(RenÃ©?) wants to try tweaking khash and timing it, be my guest.

I do think if it took the more usual pass-by-const-pointer we'd probably
still end up with the exact same code from an optimizing compiler, since
all of the references and dereferences would cancel out once it was
inlined.
