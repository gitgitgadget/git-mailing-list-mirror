Hi Felipe, Michael, and Amir,

I agree with Michael. Please don't do this- it's quite
distasteful. Johannes might have had a bad day and acted a little
inappropriately, Amir might have done something to trigger it, or it
might have been a combination of several other things. None of that
justifies all the time we're wasting on this issue.

Right. There was ONE distrubing incident on a Wiki. Let's not blow it
out of proportion and waste our time digging up dirt on one of our
own contributors.

As part of the community, let us take the reponsibility for this
mistake and work towards becoming more friendly towards foreigners as
a community. Michel has already suggested some quick steps to take to
bury this discussion quickly- I'm in favor of doing it as soon as
possible and personally seeing my inbox fill up with patches
instead. Not at all to say that we should take the issue lightly, but
I never thought we'd discuss it at this length.

Amir: We as a community are sorry that you've been treated
unfairly. Thanks for letting us know; we'll make sure that this
doesn't happen with others in future.

Thanks.

-- Ram
