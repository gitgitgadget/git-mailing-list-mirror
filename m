Yes, I think this is just a bug. If the user requested --no-thread, then
we should be sending each patch as it appears on disk, with no
modification to the in-reply-to header.

Right. Most of the values we parse are declared inside the process_file
function, and so start empty. $in_reply_to is special in that we need to
carry its value across multiple files, so we need to always handle it in
each loop iteration, whether we are setting it to a new value or
resetting it to null.

Your patch looks like the right direction. Handling $references at the
same time is the right thing to do. The extra setting of $subject seems
weird, though.

We'd want to add a test to t/t9001-send-email.sh, too, I'd think.
