OK, this thread seems to have died, which I'll take to mean that
everybody either agrees or doesn't care.

So let's do this:

  1. There will be a committee of 3-5 Gits who will act as liaisons to
     the SFC. A simple majority of that committee is required to
     authorize SFC to do stuff (like disburse money). Existing members
     can be removed from and new members can be added to the committee
     by simple majority vote of the existing committee.

     As for the initial committee, Gitzilla already nominated Junio,
     Shawn, and me. Those sound like a good start to me (assuming the
     other two accept). I'm happy to hear other nominations. I think
     starting with the 3 of us would be fine, too, and we can add people
     who become interested in the management of git and the sfc (and if
     there _is_ anybody who is interested now, please speak up and/or
     nominate yourself; I can think of many people on the list who would
     be good candidates, but the main issue seems to me that nobody is
     interested. :) ).

  2. We'll give 10% of incoming Git money to the SFC for their
     operations (where incoming git money is basically SoC money plus
     any donations SFC collects on our behalf).

Unless I hear objections on the list, this is what I'll present to the
SFC as our plan.
