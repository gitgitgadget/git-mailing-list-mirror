It's a little awkward because the lazy load happens in a conditional.
You can fully encapsulate it like the patch below, but I actually don't
think it's really helping readability.

Right, that would be the correct spot. I'm OK to leave it until somebody
complains. Looking at commit-slab again, its functions are straight
statics, not static inline. That's probably the important difference.

Unless we know something is a performance win to inline, I'd generally
prefer not to.

For a case like this with auto-generated functions, I'm mostly worried
about bloating the compiled code. Either with a bunch of inlined
non-trivial functions, or cases where the compiler says "this is too big
to inline" and generates an anonymous file-scope function, but we end up
with a bunch of duplicates, because we're generating the same functions
in a bunch of C files.

I may be worried about nothing, though. I don't know how clever the
compiler and linker can be there.
