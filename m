Doesn't that have the opposite issue? If we expect non-empty output but
the command produces empty output, we'd say "bug in the test script".
But that is not true at all; it's a failed test.

If we assume that "expect" is first (which is our convention but not
necessarily guaranteed), then I think the best logic is something like:

  if $1 is empty; then
    bug in the test script
  elif test_cmp_allow_empty "$@"
    test failure

We do not need to check $2 at all. An empty one is either irrelevant (if
the expectation is empty), or a test failure (because it would not match
the non-empty $1).

If we go that route, we should make sure that test_cmp's documentation
is updated to mention that the two sides are not symmetric (and possibly
update some callers, though I'd be OK leaving ones that aren't broken by
this, and just clean them up over time).
