That's my impression, yes.

You can do something like this already:

  git config diff.utf16.textconv 'iconv -f utf16 -t utf8'
  echo file diff=utf16 >.gitattributes

I have no objection to teaching it that "encoding" means roughly the
same thing, which would have two advantages:

 - we could do it in-process, which would be much faster

 - we could skip the extra config step, which is a blocker for
   server-side diffs on sites like GitHub

I don't think you'd really need "--encoding". This could just be
triggered by the normal "--textconv" rules (i.e., just treat this "as
if" the textconv above was configured when we see an encoding
attribute).

That extends it beyond what textconv can do (we assume that textconv
patches are _just_ for human consumption, and can't be applied). And it
would mean you'd potentially want to trigger it in more places. On the
other hand, I don't know that we're guaranteed that a round-trip
between encodings will produce a byte-wise identical result. The nice
thing about piggy-backing on textconv is that it's already dealt with
that problem.
