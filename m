That would be great, thanks.

At this point I'm most interested in higher-level questions: Are things
in a sensible order?  What's the most important material that's not
covered?  Etc.  Not that fixes to the details aren't helpful too, of
course.

It still feels really rough, so I'm expecting it to take some time
before we'd want to point newbies to it as the place to go for an
in-depth git introduction.
