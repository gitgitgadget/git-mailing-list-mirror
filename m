Thanks for describing the problem, and for laying out a few options!

I went with this option, which was to swap patches 2/6 and 4/6, and then
squashing 3/6 into what _was_ 4/6 (but is now 2/5).

That all said, I am not sure that I follow the explanation that we need
to have 'write_commit_graph_ctx' store the normalized object_dir, since
we can use 'odb->path' for this instead. I double checked, and we
already do the same loose normalization in
'sha1-file.c:link_alt_odb_entry()', where we remove trailing slashes.

This isn't the exact same normalization strictly speaking. It differs
only in that we remove more than one trailing slash if it exists, but
this seems acceptable for the 2 patches that this behavior changes lives
on for.

I double checked that the 'odb->path' is normalized relative to the $PWD,
in which case I think that we can rely on it as a stand-in for
'object_dir', and don't have to store both.
