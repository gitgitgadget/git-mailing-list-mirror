You can post self-destructing messages by adding X-no-archive: yes if I
am not mistaken.  But that only concerns stuff you post yourself.

Frankly, I find it weird that vger.kernel.org does not have an archive
of its own.  But yes, that makes it unlikely that silent censorship is
much of a thing.  A list moderator may put a particular sender on silent
moderation, where postings will only appear once he has acknowledged
them.  However, that is a manual and burdensome process and requires an
up-front decision to do so.  Once a message made it to the list, the
various archives will pick it up.
