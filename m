Trying to think back on times I might have used a feature like this,
most of them are like the first case (though I admit I was always
content with "git branch --set-upstream-to" after the fact).

I do hit the other case, too, with something like:

  git checkout next
  ... hack hack hack ...
  # oops, I meant to do this on top of master
  git checkout -b new-branch --track=origin/master HEAD
  git rebase --onto=origin/master HEAD~2

though given the rebase trickery, I tend to instead just do now:

  git checkout -b new-branch origin
  git cherry-pick -2 HEAD@{1}

I don't know if that really goes to show anything. I'm mostly just
thinking out loud.

But wouldn't just about any two tips in a repository share some common
ancestry? There are obviously funny exceptions like rewriting history,
or storing unrelated branches, but for the most part you'd find _some_
merge base, even if it's a root commit. So it seems like that check is
unlikely to help prevent accidents, would possibly be an impediment to
something clever the user is doing (albeit quite rarely), and makes the
feature slightly harder to describe. That doesn't seem worth it.
