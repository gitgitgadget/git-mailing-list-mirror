Well, when you're comparing it to some exponential algorithm with the
other technique, even a scripted language can do well. :)

I definitely remember getting big speedups back at the time of that
commit. But applying the patch below, building object_id.cocci.patch
actually gets a few seconds slower. So maybe something changed between
the various coccinelle versions. At any rate, it doesn't seem worth
pursuing further.

It's not set in my environment. However, I was able to solve it by
fiddling with my system python packages (I'm not sure of the exact
cause; it was a case of corrected-while-testing).
