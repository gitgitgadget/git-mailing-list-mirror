I think those multi-branch cases end up as an improvement with a helper:

  if (match_opt(arg, "--no-walk", &optarg)) {
	if (!optarg || !strcmp(optarg, "sorted"))
		revs->no_walk = REVISION_WALK_NO_WALK_SORTED;
	else if (!strcmp(optarg, "unsorted"))
		revs->no_walk = REVISION_WALK_NO_WALK_UNSORTED;
	else
		return error(...);
  }

I think you could still handle them both in the same branch, like:

  if (match_opt(arg, "--pretty", &optarg) ||
      skip_prefix(arg, "--format=", &optarg)) {
       revs->verbose_header = 1;
       revs->pretty-given = 1;
       /* OK to pass NULL for --pretty case */
       get_commit_format(optarg, revs);
  }

I care less about lines of boilerplate code and more about repeated
logic. In the --pretty example above, the first two lines of the block
are common to both --pretty and --pretty=. If they ever need to change,
somebody has to update two spots.

Anyway. I certainly don't insist on you working on this, especially if
you don't agree with the aesthetics. Just fixing the actual bugs would
be sufficient for my review. ;)

There's a flag, PARSE_OPT_OPTARG, which would do what you want. But I
agree that converting the whole thing to parse-options would be a lot of
work (quite a few of these really aren't just "this is a string", but
would need independent callback functions.
