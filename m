I think these look good.  And yes, it is better to insure that the
stat struct is always well-defined rather than sometimes uninitialized.


FWIW, in
f954c7b8ff3 (fsmonitor: never set CE_FSMONITOR_VALID on submodules, 
2022-05-26)
we try to never set the CE_FSMONITOR_VALID bit on submodules (because
status on a submodule is much more than just an lstat check on the
submodule root directory and we always should recursively ask Git to
compute the submodule's status).

I haven't had time to investigate, but I wonder if the original
complaint on `diff-lib` was due to another code path that allowed
the CE_FSMONITOR_VALID bit to get set on a submodule entry.
