I don't think the transformation could be wrong without the original
code being wrong.

I'm also not sure why mine would be unsafe and yours would be safe. It
seems like the other way around, because mine will do:

  *dst = ...

which would fail unless "dst" is a pointer. Whereas in yours, we end up
with:

  dst = ...

and somebody mistaking pointer assignment for a struct copy would not
notice.

But either way, I don't think we can have a rule like "you can use
struct assignment only if you don't have a pointer for the destination".
That's too arcane to expect developers and reviewers to follow. We
should either allow struct assignment or not.

Or have I totally misunderstood your point?
