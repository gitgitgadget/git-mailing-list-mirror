There are a few code paths which unset the "parsed" flag, and could
cause us to actually re-load an object. I doubt we could trigger any
here. And AFAICT this is what the original code was doing inside the
helper function anyway.

I do wonder what this is supposed to do for refs that point to
non-commits (both before and after your patch). Are we failing to clear
the flags on them?

I guess not, because we do not pass "--objects" to the traversal in the
first place, so we would never visit them (though that also makes me
wonder if we do the wrong thing in the verification step for such a
ref).
