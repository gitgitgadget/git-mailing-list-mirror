Thinking about some options...

After a `git init`: We can hack HEAD to "ref: refs/heads/" (i.e. a
symref to an unnamed branch) and `git status` will report "No commits yet".
My PS1 will report the current branch as "()" (i.e. an empty name).

However,
`git branch` reports "Failed to resolve HEAD as a valid ref.", and
`git commit` reports "cannot lock ref 'HEAD': there is a non-empty
directory '.git/refs/heads/' blocking reference 'refs/heads/'".

So, there could be the option to detect that unnamed ref state (no
characters after the final "/") without going "Fatal:".

However there is still the potential difficulty that after the first
commit on that unnamed branch we would have the difficult choice of:

- either keeping that unnamed ref/branch symref, and have nowhere to
hold the new commit name (oid), because HEAD is already acting as the
place holder for the symref,
- or we have to lose the place holder symref and place the new commit
oid into HEAD, leaving us back at the regular "detached head", but for
an as yet unnamed orphan branch.
(tested on Windows[1])

For the second case we would still need to ensure thatÂ  protections are
in place to avoid loosing those detached commits if the user
switches/checks out to new branch based on some other oid. (for that to
happen then that checkout oid must be somewhere in the unnamed branch,
but the latest tip commits should need checking to prevent unexpected
loss - the current warning may not be enough...)

At the moment there is a lot of 'lock-in' for the status quo, and the
alternative may not be any better, and have some backward compatibility
issues, though those may be overstated, depending on how repos are being
'shared'.
