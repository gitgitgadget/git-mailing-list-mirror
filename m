I spent a while thinking and experimenting with this tonight. The result
is the patch below. Ã†var, do you still have a copy of the repo that
misbehaved? I'd be curious to see how it fares.

Finding the right trees to explore is a little tricky with bitmaps.  In
a normal traversal, we consider the "edges" to be worth exploring.
I.e., the places where an UNINTERESTING commit is the parent of an
interesting one.

But with bitmaps, we don't have that information in the same way,
because we're trying to avoid walking the commits in the first place. So
e.g., in a history like this:

  A--B--C
      \
       D

Let's imagine we're computing "C..D", and that D has a bitmap on disk
but C does not. When we visit D, we'll see that it has a bitmap, fill in
the results in our cumulative "want" bitmap, and then stop walking its
parents (because we know everything they could tell us already).

Then we visit C. It's not bitmapped, so we keep walking. Unlike a normal
traversal, we can't stop walking even though there are only
UNINTERESTING commits left, because we have to fill the complete bitmap,
including A and B (and you can imagine there might be thousands of
ancestors of A, too). The reason is that we skipped adding ancestors of
D when we saw its bitmap, so no still_interesting() cutoff will work
there.

But how do we know that it's worth looking into the tree of "B"? If we
assume we visit commits before their ancestors (because of the commit
timestamp ordering), then we'd see that "B" is in the "want" bitmap
already, which makes it worth visiting its tree.

Unfortunately we'd then continue on to "A", and it would _also_ look
interesting, because it's also in the "want" bitmap. We don't have an
easy way of knowing that "A" is basically already covered by "B", and is
therefore not worth pursuing. In this example, we could pass down a bit
from B to A as we traverse. But you can imagine another interesting
commit branched from A, which _would_ make A's tree worth considering.

Fundamentally, as soon as we load a bitmap and stop traversing, we lose
all information about the graph structure.

So the patch below just looks at every tree that might be worth
exploring (so both "A" and "B" here, but not "C"). That shouldn't be any
_worse_ than what the current code does (because it looks at all the
trees). It appears to behave correctly, at least so far as passing the
test suite. Running p5310 and p5311 against git.git and linux.git, it
seems to perform worse. I'm not quite sure why that is (i.e., if I
screwed up something in the implementation, or if the algorithm is
fundamentally worse).

There are a lot of rough edges in the patch; I was just trying to see if
the idea was even viable. So don't bother reviewing it as a real
proposal for inclusion. If you do read it, I'd recommend just looking at
the post-image, since it's essentially a rewrite and the diff is a bit
messy.
