Sounds like a good idea.

DIV_ROUND_UP(n,d) is defined as (n+d-1)/d. So this is clearly a
mechanical conversion and thus correct. And most cases are like this,
but...

...this first one is a bit trickier. Our "n" in the first one is now
"i+1".  But that's because the original was implicitly canceling the
"-1" and "+1" terms.

So I think it's a true mechanical conversion, but I have to admit the
original is confusing. Without digging I suspect it's correct, though,
just because a simple bug here would mean that our ewah bitmaps totally
don't work. So it's probably not worth spending time on.

And all the others are straight-forward and obviously correct. So this
patch looks good to me.
