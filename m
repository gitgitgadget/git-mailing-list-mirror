This is expected. The performance ratio is better when the path is any 
of the following:

1. A very deep path (need to walk multiple trees to answer TREESAME)

2. An entry is late in a very wide tree (need to spend extra time 
parsing tree object)

3. The path doesn't change very often (need to inspect many TREESAME 
pairs before finding enough interesting commits)

4. Some sub-path changes often (so the TREESAME comparison needs to 
parse beyond that sub-path often)

Our standard examples (Git and Linux repos) don't have many paths that 
have these properties. But: they do exist. In other projects, this is 
actually typical. Think about Java projects that frequently have ~5 
levels of folders before actually touching a code file.

When I was implementing the Bloom filter feature for Azure Repos, I ran 
performance tests on the Linux repo using a random sampling of paths. 
The typical speedup was 5x while some outliers were in the 25x range.

There are two questions that I was hoping to answer by looking at your code:

1. How do you store your Bloom filter? Is it connected to the 
commit-graph and split on a commit-by-commit basis (storing "$path" as a 
key), or is it one huge Bloom filter (storing "$commitid:$path" as key)?

2. Where does your Bloom filter check plug into the TREESAME logic? I 
haven't investigated this part, but hopefully it isn't too complicated.

Thanks,
