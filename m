Fix a few small issues with documentation and warnings around the limits for
the quadratic portion of rename (&copy) detection, and bump the default
limits.

Discussion on bumping the limits can be found at [1]. Although it appears we
generally agree we could switch to an unlimited setting for
merge.renameLimit, that would require some changes to progress bars to
notify users how to take action once things start taking a while. So, for
now, just bump the limits.

[1]
https://lore.kernel.org/git/CABPp-BFzp3TCWiF1QAVSfywDLYrz=GOQszVM-sw5p0rSB8RWvw@mail.gmail.com/T/#u

Changes since v2:

 * Change the meaning of "0" to actually mean unlimited, and modify the
   documentation to mention that.
 * Added 'currently' to descriptions to make it clear the defaults are
   likely to change (again).
 * Added a brief explanation of the exhaustive portion of rename detection,
   as requested by Ã†var (though, honestly, I think the thing that actually
   helps people pick values for the limit is the warning that tells people
   that rename detection was skipped and how high they need to set the limit
   if they want to redo the operation and get renames).

Changes since v1:

 * Shuffled patch order since the explanation of why "inexact rename
   detection" is incorrect was in the third patch
 * Use the term "exhaustive rename detection" for the quadratic portion
 * Simplify -l description by just stating that it defaults to
   diff.renameLimit (since it in turn has the right default value)
 * Fix asciidoc formating
 * Include bump of the limits in a new patch

Elijah Newren (4):
  diff: correct warning message when renameLimit exceeded
  doc: clarify documentation for rename/copy limits
  diffcore-rename: treat a rename_limit of 0 as unlimited
  Bump rename limit defaults (yet again)
