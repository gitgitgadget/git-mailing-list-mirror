That sounds reasonable. I do wonder, though, whether simply creating the
prereq directory in the _current_ directory would be sufficient. Then
you'd get prereq-test-dir/prereq-test-dir for a nested invocation. But
the prereqs aren't supposed to care about which specific directory
they're in.

I.e., your test passes equally well with just:

diff --git a/t/test-lib-functions.sh b/t/test-lib-functions.sh

though I guess it is not really much simpler (it avoids the funky
quoting around $1 in the embedded script, but we already have that for
$2). And perhaps debugging is easier with a more predictable and
descriptive directory name.

I was surprised to see this bare exit, because I know we have some
functions (run_sub_test_*) to help with testing the framework itself. It
looks like the other prereq tests don't use it either, though. I wonder
if there is a technical reason, or if they were simply added at a
different time. (Either way, I am OK for your new test to match the
surrounding ones like you have here).
