I tend to disagree.  Git at least _enables_ you to have the 
one-committer-per-repository scheme, it even _encourages_ it to a certain 
extent.

And once you go that route, it is easy to see that the committer says "I 
will not let that _crap_ enter my repository."  Bingo, peer review.

Compare that to a centralised repository, where more often than not, the 
administrator is not even part of the developer community!  It is much 
easier not to feel too responsible for the code you are committing there.

Ciao,
Dscho
