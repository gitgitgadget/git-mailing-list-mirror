That sounds like a good strategy. I'm wondering if we should not change 
the behavior of `--keep-redundant-commits` to avoid breaking existing 
users but have `--empty=keep|drop` not imply `--allow-empty`. What ever 
we do we'll annoy someone. It is confusing to have subtly different 
behaviors for `--keep-redundant-commits` and `--empty=keep` but it 
avoids breaking existing users. If we change `--keep-redundant-commits` 
we potentially upset existing users but we don't confuse others with the 
subtle difference between the two.

Maybe I've missed something but that seems to be an argument for 
implementing `--empty=drop` which is completely reasonable but doesn't 
explain why someone using `--keep-redundant-commits` would want to keep 
the commits that become empty while dropping the commits that start empty.

I agree with that

There is definitely an argument that the existing behavior conflates the 
two flavors of empty commit. I think one can also argue that the 
conflation is beneficial as most of the time users don't care about the 
distinction when using `--keep-redundant-commits` and so it is not worth 
changing the behavior of the existing option.

I sounds like you've got a good plan for v2, I look forward to reading it.

Best Wishes
