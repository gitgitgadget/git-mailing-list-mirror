Yeah, agreed.

In my mind, "argv" is synonymous with "NULL-terminated array of
strings". If the name is the only thing keeping it from wider use, I'd
much prefer us to give it a more generic name. All I really care about
is simplifying memory management. :)

Even better.

Yeah, I think manually combining the two here is fine. Though I won't
complain if you want to look into setting the config earlier. If the
refactoring isn't too bad, it would probably provide the nicest outcome.

Good point.

Yes, exactly. Mostly I was suggesting that if you do "--origin=foo",
then we do not fetch items named "remote.origin.fetch" (i.e., that the
code correctly uses the origin variable and not the hard-coded name
"origin").
