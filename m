Seems like an easy win (well, neglecting the other 14 patches that let
to having gitcomp_direct).

I never really noticed it as particularly slow in git.git, but faster is
always better if it comes cheaply.

I just tried "git grep foo<Tab>" in the kernel and it was pretty fast.
But then I tried "git grep <Tab>". Ouch. So it seems like it's not the
awk matching that's slow, but everything that comes after (and is
dependent on how much output it produces).
