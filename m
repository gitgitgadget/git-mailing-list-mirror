Well, maybe so called "Windows pseudo-developers" do not feel welcome to 
participate to this particular project? Or maybe this project has not 
reached yet the minimum visibility threshold? git has a lot of 
contributors on Linux because it is visible there. Do you think all 
users of git on Linux systematically contributes?

Don't get me wrong, I am truly thankful for msysgit but, IMHO, if you 
produce and publish a free software you should just accept and be glad 
that it is used. Otherwise, just don't publish it.

And a lot other projects do not bother with this even on Windows and Mac 
too.
