There are two options: first, to tell the reader upfront that objects
id would be different / would change.  This has the advantage that
you do not need to update those objects when you change instructions
in the middle. Note that commit objects are not the only things that
change; for example the result of `ls -l` would also be slightly
different.

Another possibility is to set authordate and committerdate to some
specified time by the way of appropriate environment variables.

What I think you don't realize is that "commit" objects are not
treated in any way special. Object identifiers of all objects are
SHA-1 hash of uncompressed loose representation of said object
(type + length + contents).

Well, you could not record dates in commit object, but I think
Git considers such objects broken.

IMVHO it would require heavy surgery of Git for little benefit
(see the beginning of reply for alternate solutions).
