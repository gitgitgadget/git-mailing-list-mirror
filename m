The idea seems reasonable to me. Let's think about what the escape hatch
looks like to work around it if you need to.

I guess you've got:

  cat >file &&
  test_i18ngrep ... file

which is not too bad.

You've also got:

  test_i18ngrep ... -

though that relies on the underlying grep understanding "-" (which is in
POSIX, though with a rather vague "if the implementations supports it").
And it wouldn't work with the "read" test in this patch.

This seems kind of hacky compared to just seeing if there is a file
argument. But I suppose that is hard to do, since we just pass through
the arguments to grep.

Though looking at our test_18ngrep invocations, they are simple enough
that would just ask "are there two non-option arguments at the end of
the command line". The exception is "-e", but IMHO we could just drop
that. It serves no purpose unless you're trying to hide a "-" at the
start of your pattern, and in fact we used to ban it since sysv grep
didn't understand it (e.g., aadbe44f883).
