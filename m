Google has offered to host GitTogether '09 at its Mountain View
headquarters.

Tentative dates would be Oct. 26th-28th (Monday - Wednesday).

A short survey for those who might be interested in attending:

These dates offer a schedule like we had last year in terms of
immediately following another particular event that makes many people
fly to Mountain View each fall.  That other event date has not yet
been announced externally, so if you deduce it from this message,
please forget that you did and do not share it with anyone else.  :-)

The date is still tentative, as we'd like to make GitTogether '09
follow that other event, and the other event's date isn't set in
stone yet.  But its highly unlikely to move.

Arrangements would be similar to last year.  Google would provide
meeting space and breakfast, lunch, drinks for up to 30 attendees,
though final head count also depends upon having sufficent Googlers
to attend.
