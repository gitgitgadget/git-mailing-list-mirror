In the very original use case reported in the git for windows issues
pages, I understood it that the provider of the git-foo script expected
that they would include some detection and response to the --help being
given as an option.

They had the issue that their windows users, using Git for Windows, do
not have the `man` package installed. Rather the `web` help of using the
.html version of the man page is used (needs administrator install in
some case). So user commands would need to provide both the man page for
Linux systems and some process to get the html equivalent into the right
folder - this latter case was the problem step.Â 

The expectation from the XY-Problem was that if the html (and possibly,
by implication, the man page) was not found by git, that the --help
option would be passed to the command itself for it the command to
process (or ignore)..

It is a bit of a rabbit hole.
