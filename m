That works fine when it is signed off by employers using their company
e-mail, but that is not feasible in my case - what should be in the
Signed-off-line? Name of the company? What about the e-mail? Some
generic e-mail of the legal department? That doesn't really work well
with all the machinery developed around s-o-b lines, besides the
question does not seem to be by far that simple with such a huge
corporation.
