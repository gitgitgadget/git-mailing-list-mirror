Hi,

I've just downloaded git-for-windows. It uninstalled an earlier
version that I had (about 5 years old) and I got some problems.

1)  It wanted to install into my User directory instead of the
Program Files directory, which is the best place for all programs.
The installer told me that this had access right problems, so I
installed it into another directory. It seemed to go OK.

2)  However,  the  icons  on  the desktop pointed to the place that my
previous installation had been ( C:\Program Files (x86)\Git ) - that's
where I'd have hoped that the new installation would go!

3)  I  uninstalled it to see if a cleaner installatoin would work, and
the  GIT-GUI icon didn't disappear  from the desktop - minor bug I
suspect.
 
 
Regards,
 
Peter
