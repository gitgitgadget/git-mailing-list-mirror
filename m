 hi , I am have cloned the
git://gitorious.org/~dbeck/hawkboard/dbeck-hawkboard-linux-omapl1.git
  found at http://gitorious.org/~dbeck/hawkboard/dbeck-hawkboard-linux-omapl1...
Now I see there is a tab called Commit log ...The git that I have
cloned , would it include the commits in totality or will I have to do
somethng diferent to get the commits into the git that I cloned on my
PC. git checkout -f master git pull  ... Is this .?
Thanks
