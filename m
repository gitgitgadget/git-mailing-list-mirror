Hello !

git-gui is a nice application and I like to use it while developping.
However as probably a lot of developpers do, I regularly code in Emacs
from a distant ssh client.
Therefor I'd want to find some app like git-gui running in console...
Does this exist or is there a project in development ?

Thanks for info
