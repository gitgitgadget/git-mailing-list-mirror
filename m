That feels a bit like we're playing a game of chicken with the compiler
in terms of what it may complain about. For example, sparse will
complain:

  foo.c:1:5: warning: symbol 'dummy_for_dep_check' was not declared. Should it be static?

Might compilers ever learn to warn of the same thing?

I kind of like the simplicity of Ã†var's approach. We want to know if the
compiler can be invoked with options XYZ, so we do so. That should be
largely independent of our cflags, and there's prior art in how we
invoke it in the detect-compiler script.

So I'd argue we should go even simpler, like:

diff --git a/Makefile b/Makefile
index 3628d14f16..4597a126d0 100644
--- a/Makefile

I'm also tempted by a hunk like this. Then we can set the REQUIRE flag
in a CI job (or locally for git devs who know they have gcc) and notice
an unexpected breakage in the auto test.
