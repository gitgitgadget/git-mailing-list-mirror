Oh, you're right. I didn't notice the fall-through, which is quite
subtle (I'm actually surprised -Wimplicit-fallthrough doesn't complain
about this).

I'll fix up the commit message (the cleanup is still very much worth it
for the garbage-oid issue, IMHO).

Yeah, I was tempted to write:

  if (skip_prefix(data, "P ", &data) &&
      skip_prefix(data, "pack-", &data) &&
      ...

but that felt a little silly. I dunno. I guess it is probably not any
less efficient, because we'd expect skip_prefix() and its loop to get
inlined here anyway.
