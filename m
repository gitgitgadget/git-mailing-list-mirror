Maths Chase is a completely free and fun game where you can quickly test your times tables, along with many other maths skills!  The site features a simple learning game.  We hope kids will find it a fun and different way to improve their times table accuracy and speed.

We are currently visited by thousands daily and are connected to over 1000 schools.
