The HEAD branch on the server side is still pointing at
refs/heads/master. But since that doesn't exist, upload-pack doesn't
advertise HEAD at all (it has no sha1).

You can recreate this situation with:

  cd /some/repo
  git init --bare dst.git
  git push dst.git HEAD:refs/heads/MASTER
  git ls-remote dst.git

No current-branch deletion required.

FÃ©lix should be able to re-point the server-side HEAD to MASTER via
GitHub's web interface.

GitHub's post-receive hook usually does that automatically if you push a
branch to a repository with an unborn HEAD. But I think there may be
corner cases where it gets confused.
