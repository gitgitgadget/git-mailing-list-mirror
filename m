Having mostly forgotten about our earlier discussion, I got confused by
this, thinking the problem was that there is some issue with missing
NULs in the input.

But it is really just:

  We read() into a buffer and on error format the contents using "%s".
  But read() does not NUL-terminate, so die() might walk past the end of
  the buffer.

We _might_ be saved by a NUL in the input, but that is not the primary
concern. ;)

Not worth a re-roll on its own, but since there is some other
discussion, I thought I'd mention my confusion. :)

Patch itself looks good to me.
