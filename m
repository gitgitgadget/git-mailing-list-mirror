I actually once tried to change it to git's birthday (Thu Apr 7
15:13:13 2005 -0700) and I recall that it turned out that some
people's scripts (or perhaps MUA) were broken and cared what was
before "7" (nothing, as show_date() does, " " to align to two
columns per date, "0" to zero-pad align) on the Unix-From line
and discarded that update.

I do not think it is worth changing it.  Who's hurting with the
current behaviour?  In other words, is it broken?  Unix-From
lines are there only to separate each piece of e-mail in the
mbox and otherwise is not used.  send-email, am, nor imap-send
should care anything beyond the leading "From ", and mailsplit
validates only that what's around the last colon near the end of
line looks like time and year.
