Note that if cache is generated during (re)packing, it could be optimized
for reading. If we want a cache that follow replacements, it would need
to be adjusted after each new or modified replacement; assuming that one
doesn't modify replacements by hand (then Git would need to detect changes,
and modify cache if needed, perhaps on query, e.g. "git log").

It would be nice to have as an optional check, like e.g. unreachable
objects, or use warning instead of error, like e.g. dangling objects
warning. This would be the default; it can always be changed using
the `fsck.<msg-id>` and `receive.fsck.<msg-id>` configuration variables.

This way we could use this mode to adjust clock-skew heuristics that
Git uses to speed up reachability queries (including time slop), be
it automatically or via a configuration variable.

Well, check at "git commit" time (perhaps with automatic fixing to used
committerdate for the commit being created, within specified conditions)
cannot distinguish between the two cases:

 * committerdate in parent commit(s) is correct,
   but the clock is in the past

 * committerdate in parent commit(s) is incorrect, and in the future,
   while the clock is correct

Well, one heuristics is that if commits in the future, and/or commits
with committerdate out of order have all the same committer, then
probably commits are broken. Another "heuristics" would be to assume
that if you invoked date-checking functionality, you have ensured that
your clock is correct.
