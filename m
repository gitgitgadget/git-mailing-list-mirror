A broader question is "how does the dev environment handle lone `CR`
characters? are they also considered as EOLs?"

If I recall previous discussions, part of the issue is determining what
the alternate abuse cases are, such as lone CRs, or alternate character
sets to the 'pure' utf-8.

You will still have the difficulty of how `identicality` is determined,
which currently uses the sha1/oid value. In essence you need a way of
ensuring that all checkins are always of one defined EOL, but then need
git to have a broader allowance of changed EOL values (including no lone
CRs that are not EOL, etc).

Does the environment (on any of the OS's) change the files in the
background, such that the file time stamps will indicate a modification?
