I happened to read two or three articles of Dan Lyons (yes, I read Groklaw 
and tried to find out if Dan Lyons really investigated the facts, or left 
out unpleasing details deliberately). I found that he not only lacks in 
style, but in presenting all the facts.

It's one thing to be biased.

It's another thing completely, to leave out facts you don't want to be 
true.

As Linus said, everybody is opinionated. But if somebody twists the facts 
to say something what they didn't originally, I don't read his articles 
any longer. As simple as that.

Ciao,
Dscho
