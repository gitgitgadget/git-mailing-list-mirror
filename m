Git Merge 2018 is happening on March 8th; there will be a Contributor's
Summit the day before. Here are the details:

  When: Wednesday, March 7, 2018. 10am-5pm.
  Where: Convent Dels Ã€ngels[1], Barcelona, Spain
  What: Round-table discussion about Git
  Who: All contributors to Git or related projects in the Git ecosystem
       are invited; if you're not sure if you qualify, just ask!

In order to attend, you'll need to register ahead of time. There's a
super-secret link to do so; email me and I will provide it.
Registration is free, and comes with a ticket to the main conference on
the 8th (which I encourage you to attend, but you don't have to).

As with past years, the agenda is whatever we choose. We'll have room
for about 25 people with "boardroom-style seating" and a projector.
Come prepared with topics to present or discuss.

If you're interested in financial aid for traveling to the conference,
please send an email to git@sfconservancy.org.  And please do so soon
(let's say by the end of next week, Jan 26th), so that we have an idea
of the number and size of requests before making any grants.
