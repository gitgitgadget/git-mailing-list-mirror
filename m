Yep, this seems trivially correct. The key observation is that we are
filling the array in order:

Perhaps obvious, but I got bit trying to do another similar conversion
recently that was filling in the array out-of-order (not on the list,
but in some improvements in the bitmap code that haven't been sent in
yet).
