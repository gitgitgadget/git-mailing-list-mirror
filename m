Ah, your "address I wrote in the compose buffer" was the clue I needed.

I think this is actually an existing bug. If I use --compose and write:

  To: foo@example.com

in the editor, we read that back in and handle it in parse_header_line()
like:

        my $addr_pat = join "|", qw(To Cc Bcc);

        foreach (split(/\n/, $lines)) {
                if (/^($addr_pat):\s*(.+)$/i) {
                        $parsed_line->{$1} = [ parse_address_line($2) ];
                } elsif (/^([^:]*):\s*(.+)\s*$/i) {
                        $parsed_line->{$1} = $2;
                }
        }

and there's your perl array ref (from the square brackets, which are
necessary because we're sticking it in a hash value). But even before
your patch, this seems to end up as garbage. The code which reads
$parsed_line does not dereference the array.

The patch to fix it is only a few lines (well, more than that with some
light editorializing in the comments):

I don't really think your patch makes things worse here. But it is
probably worth fixing it while we are here.
