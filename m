Yeah, I found after Junio's hint :) What threw me off, as I wrote 
earlier, get_terms(). I wonder now, why is get_terms() implemented as it 
is, and should it not use the same functions? Or is it because terms is 
a multi-line file, whereas the others are all single line (I didn't 
look, though I see addline functions for the strbuf functions. Should 
this be refactored?

So with the name, I started to think some more about it, and after 
playing with some names, I settled on 'bisect-post-checkout'. Things 
then sort of fell more into place. It is still a hook/commandline 
option, but it's a much smaller change (since we don't have any special 
code to check the exit code anymore) as we can (obviously) run `git 
bisect skip` instead of `exit 125` as well of course. The `exit 125` 
thinking came from `git bisect run` and maybe a suggestion on the ML 
earlier (I don't quite recall).

So as I explained above, I think just offering a 'post-checkout' step, 
and let the user decide what to do there, makes things even simpler and 
more flexible.

I've just pushed my latest changes to 
https://gitlab.com/olliver/git/-/commit/4361a5deb0c5ee4c113c25b57752af61b74aabf3 
and will start working on some tests before offering it for review again.

Thank you!
