"The add worktree documentation states:
    Create <path> and checkout <branch> into it. The new working directory is linked to the ***current repository***, sharing everything except working directory specific files such as HEAD, index, etc. - may also be specified as <branch>; it is synonymous with @{-1}."

So I'm going to assume that clone from a worktree is not supported. This sounds like a check is needed to prevent the operation from starting up in the first place, or changing the semantics to allow it. The error message, while cryptic, seems actually descriptive because the HEAD would not be available in a worktree as it is not propagated from the current repository.

If the idea is to support an add worktree from a worktree, I would suggest that a new branch go back to the main repository as normal, rather than being added to the worktree. I personally get a headache thinking about the prospect of having layers of worktrees.

Cheers,
Randall
