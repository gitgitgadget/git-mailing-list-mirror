I don't find "info" useful, either. The big thing it offers over "man"
is actual hyperlinks, but linkgit attributes (the only thing we actually
bother annotating) don't seem to actually become links! These days I'd
expect most people interested in hyperlinking to just use HTML.  I
wouldn't be surprised if there's some emacs integration with info,
though, so maybe people use it there. I dunno. I'd be happy to see all
of the info bits go away.

I've add brian to the cc, since he was the last person to touch texi
stuff (though he may have just been doing it out of a sense of
cleanup/duty).

The .texi generated for the user-manual is the same before and after
your patch, so I think it's OK to do.

There _is_ an older regression in the user-manual, though. After commit
03920ac69b (asciidoctor: fix user-manual to be built by `asciidoctor`,
2017-01-02), the whole front-matter is missing from the generated
"git.info" file, and there's a funky ": idm4" node. Nobody seems to have
noticed or complained since then (though perhaps people are more likely
to look at the manpages than the user manual).

Yeah, this looks good to me (and it looks like Junio already picked it
up on top of your series).
