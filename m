This does not apply anymore. I forgot to delete it.

Since you are using "git commit-graph write", the command is scanning
all pack-files for commits to include. Even in this case, the
close_reachable() method needs to walk to see if any commits are missing.
(It could be that the root commit is loose for some strange reason.)

In this case, we are marking REACHABLE the commits that can be reached
from our "starting" commits. In your example we start with every commit.

If you had used `git commit-graph write --stdin-packs` and provided a
small pack name over stdin, the concept would be similar and even more
pronounced: the pack (perhaps downloaded via 'fetch') is not likely to
contain every commit, so we need to walk all reachable commits from
those included.

I'll have a v3 today with the requested fixes.

Thanks,
