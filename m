Dear kernel hackers & Git lovers,

some of you might have noticed already that today we celebrate 5 years
of Linux kernel development in Git. After looking for an alternative to
Bitkeeper, Linus came up with his own solution and wrote that new tool
he called Git. Exactly 5 years ago, Linus announced Linux-2.6.12-rc2  by
making the the very first commit into the official Linux kernel Git
tree. So we made a little movie to visualize the source code development
of Linux over these past 5 years of Git history.

The video was made with Gource, a source code visualization tool. Yes,
there are some bugs in the video, but we found the overall idea way too
cool to not share the result with you. You can find the video online in
different formats.

You can find a preview teaser on Youtube at

  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntTpM8hfl_E

The torrents are linked on the page.

We hope you enjoy the video and celebrate 5 years of Linux kernel
development in Git with us.
