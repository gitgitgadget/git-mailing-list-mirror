I got busy with other things and haven't had a chance to get back to this
until now. I very much appreciate the help but I'm still unclear on this
part:

>git-svn has (IMO) a good branching UI, but can be very slow for large
repositories.

http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/158940/focus=159151 :
note this thread is almost a year out of date now, and even I know much
better ways to go about this now -- but the scripts are not written. 

I don't really understand that. So...how do I convert from svn to git while
keeping branches and tags intact? If it's automated, I don't care about
speed: I can just start it and move on to other things while it's working.
