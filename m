Yay, I'm very happy to see this series. I'd be happy to go even further
if there's some benefit, but I think this removes the last of the
Makefile knobs.

Thanks for splitting each version bump into its own patch. That made it
a lot easier to see what we we're gaining from each one.

I double-checked that there's no difference with doc-diff when using a
modern asciidoc/docbook combo, though I'm sure you did as well.

Yeah, dropping that bit from user-manual.conf seems reasonable. That
shouldn't show anything in doc-diff because it's not installed with the
manpages. And the HTML build wouldn't use docbook. I installed the
zillion packages needed to build user-manual.pdf. The behavior without
that block looks significantly nicer (the example blocks are actually
shaded).

The very first example block in section 1.1 has some funny indentation,
but that's true before or after.

Anyway, that was just for my own curiosity. If you've got further work
in that area and prefer to do it as a separate series, that's fine by
me.
