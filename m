Yes, that's very unfortunate. 

Here's a much simpler example:

A commit P has an reasonable commit date (i.e. after release of Git to
present) D and has a child commit C with committer date 0. Now, the 
corrected commiter date of C would D + 1 and the offset would be same too,
as the committer date is zero. This overflows as reasonable dates are of
the order 2 ^ 34.

To be honest, I would prefer storing corrected committer dates over
storing offsets.

While it is 7% of the size of commit-graph file, it is also *only* around
~3.5 MB for a repository of the size of linux kernel (and IIRC
correctly, the Windows repo has ~2M commits, it amounts to ~8 MB).

Minimizing space and memory requirements are a top priority, but
shouldn't making sure our program is correct and efficient to be a
greater priority?

I would love to hear your and Dr. Stolee's opinions on this.

We could modify the graph version in future. Here's how I think it would
work:

Graph Version 1, No GDAT -> Topological level
Graph Version 2, GDAT    -> Corrected committer dates
Graph Version 3, GDAT    -> Generation number v3

and so on.

Of course, we do not have to update generation number definition for
each graph version.

However, my statement could still be wrong for things that we do not
foresee (similar to how we missed the hard die on different graph version),
so I am removing the statement.

Thinking about this, I feel creating a new section called "Handling
Mixed Generation Number Chains" made more sense:

  ## Handling Mixed Generation Number Chains

  With the introduction of generation number v2 and generation data chunk,
  the following scenario is possible:

  1. "New" Git writes a commit-graph with a GDAT chunk.
  2. "Old" Git writes a split commit-graph on top without a GDAT chunk.

  The commits in the lower layer will be interpreted as having very large
  generation values (commit date plus offset) compared to the generation
  numbers in the top layer (toplogical level). This violates the
  expectation that the generation of a parent is strictly smaller than the
  generation of a child. In such cases, we revert to using topological
  levels for all layers to maintain backwards compatability.

  When writing a new layer in split commit-graph, we write a GDAT chunk
  only if the topmost layer has a GDAT chunk. This guarantees that if a
  lyer has GDAT chunk, all lower layers must have a GDAT chunk as well.

  Rewriting layers follows similar approach: if the topmost layer below
  set of layers being rewriteen (in the split commit-graph chain) exists,
  and it does not contain GDAT chunk, then the result of rewrite does not
  have GDAT chunks either.
