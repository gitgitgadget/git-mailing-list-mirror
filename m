Dear diary, on Sat, Jun 24, 2006 at 09:54:38PM CEST, I got a letter
where "Randal L. Schwartz" <merlyn@stonehenge.com> said that...
> I think my point is that I read this list regularly, but
> I had no idea there was a wiki.  Where is it being promoted?
> Surely not on git(1).  Was it announced here?  How often?

It was announced in

	15227   F May 03 Petr Baudis     ( 1.1K) [ANNOUNCE] Git wiki

spawning a 61-mails thread. ;-)

It is also linked from the homepage, although not as prominently as it
should be; it grew nicely over the time so it probably deserves a more
visible link now. I will add it on the front page.
