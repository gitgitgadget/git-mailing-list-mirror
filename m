Thanks.  I'd love to see a libgit2 project this summer.

If we do have such a thing, and if I'm still wearing the maintainer
hat for libgit2, I think it would be improper for me to be the mentor
for the student.  Just as Junio abstains from mentoring any students
in GSoC, to prevent potential bias during patch review, I probably
should abstain in the case of libgit2.  Or at least move the project
to a dual-maintainer approach like we use with JGit, so the other
maintainer is the one doing the actual review and patch acceptance.
