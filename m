Oh, I was not talking about how common that command is, but how commonly 
used.

And I would be quite annoyed by "git help" telling me that there is a 
"help" command as well; how does it think I got the list to begin with?  
Of course I used "git help", so I know that command already, and do not 
need it listed with more interesting commands.

Whatever,
