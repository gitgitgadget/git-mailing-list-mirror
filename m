That message is not generated by git, but rather by the kernel, which
pulls the name from argv[0], presumably. E.g., try:

  echo 'int main() { *(int *)0=0; }' >foo.c
  gcc foo.c
  ln a.out alternate
  ./a.out; ./alternate
  dmesg | tail -n 2

which should show both program names. Git invokes git-remote-* based on
the URL you fed it. So if you are seeing a segfault in git-remote-http,
presumably you fed it an http URL (which may still execute SSL code if
it redirects to an https URL).
