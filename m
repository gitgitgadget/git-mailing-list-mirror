How having more than one admin is distasteful?

Exactly, and he might have another bad day again, and in order to
avoid this issue in the future it's useful to have other people as
admins.

I don't think it's a single incident:
Dscho blocked Amire80 (infinite, account creation blocked) (Spamming
links to external sites)

Dscho blocked Happypeter (infinite, account creation blocked) (adding
random non-information on user pages)
Dscho blocked Jheena789 (infinite, account creation blocked) (Spamming
links to external sites)
Dscho blocked AlmaBailey (infinite, account creation blocked, e-mail
blocked) (Spamming links to external sites)

How many of these people have been wrongly banned? It's impossible to
know because only Johannes (the only admin), can see the deleted
entries.

How exactly? How do we as a community ensure that Johannes is not
going to ban people unfairly? I haven't seen any acceptance of bad
behavior, nor have I seen any hint as to what he will do the next time
something like this happens.

I say we need *at least* another admin, anyone.
