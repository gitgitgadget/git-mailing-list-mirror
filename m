Yes. That is exactly where I was heading in thinking about things and 
learning more about branches. gitx or gitg really help clarify the 
relationships and allow one to think better about the organization. I 
had looked at all this early on, but was too new to be anything other 
than confused. I have enough experience now to appreciate at least some 
of it.

TIA
