There may be cases that we don't want to support because of portability
issues. E.g., if your libc has an assembly-optimized qsort() we wouldn't
want to replicate that.

I dunno. I am not that opposed to just saying "forget libc qsort, we
always use our internal one which is consistent, performant, and safe".
But when I suggested something similar for our regex library, I seem to
recall there were complaints.
