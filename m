Seems like a good idea.

We're very sloppy about checking the "ret" field from kh_put_* for
errors (it's a tri-state for "already existed", "newly added", or
"error"). I think that's not a problem because as you show here, we
can't actually hit the error case. This makes that much more obvious.

Two nits if we wanted to go further:

I converted this in b32fa95fd8 (convert trivial cases to ALLOC_ARRAY,
2016-02-22), but left the now-obsolete error-check.

But a few lines below...

These REALLOC_ARRAY() calls are in the same boat. You dropped the error
check in 2756ca4347 (use REALLOC_ARRAY for changing the allocation size
of arrays, 2014-09-16).

Should we make the two match? I'd probably do so by making the former
match the latter, and just drop the conditional and BUG entirely.

After the first hunk, does kh_resize_*() ever return anything but 0? If
not, can we drop its return entirely, making it more clear that it's not
expected to fail? Both for human readers, but also for the compiler
(which could then alert us at compile-time if we missed any error
cases).
