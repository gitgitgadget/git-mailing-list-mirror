Oh, good.  I'm waaay behind the curve and haven't seen this fix.  Even
better, now I also noticed that two bugs I was about to report have
been fixed already (though both fixes have minor flaws).

Ok, so at least the specs are consistent with the implementation.  I'm
not sure this was done in the right direction, though, because too
small Bloom filters do hurt performance.

Note that Bloom filters with power-of-two number of bits have higher
false positive probabilities when using some form of double hashing.
When going for 8 byte blocks all commits modifying <= 12 paths
(assuming 7 hashes per path) will have power-of-2 sized Bloom filters
(64 or 128 bits), and that is a lot of commits.

Oh, I haven't thought of that

Note that this should be clarified in the specs.

Well, yes, but indirectly:  according to Wikipedia :) the optimal
number of hashes per element depends only on the desired false
probability, and the optimal number of bits per element depends only
on the number of hashes per element.

So storing the min number of bits per entry seems to be redundant.

Wouldn't customizing through the number of hashes be sufficient?

Should an implementation detail like that be part of the specs?  It
sure caused a bit of confusion here.
