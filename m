No, I doubt that it's useful, and it's probably a sign of a bug
elsewhere. But it's likely a _harmless_ bug, so it may be irritating to
die when we hit it rather than continuing.

I dunno. I could go either way. Or we could leave it as-is, and let
valgrind find the problem. That has zero run-time cost, but of course
nobody bothers to run valgrind outside of the test suite, so the inputs
are not usually very exotic.

Yes, the overlap case is probably an actual bug. Detecting it is a bit
harder, but definitely possible. I hate to pay the run-time cost for it,
but I wonder if a compiler could optimize it out.

Yes, see my other reply. :)
