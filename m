Yeah -- that's what I'd implemented. I was just thinking that I'd want to
test the issue that caused the problem in the first place, but it's the
same code path either way.

I like the idea of limiting to the total number of objects in the
pack. If we do that, we don't need a knob at all, since if we need
more objects in the stack than are in the pack, it's obviously
invalid.

That does eliminate an obvious way to test things, and we'd need
to provide in an invalid pack file.
