Hi,

The organisation I am currently working for uses 'git'.

In order to manage all the software used in the organisation we have been compiling a list of software that includes the software Vendor's name.

My colleague has listed the vendor of git as being the 'Software Freedom Conservancy'. Can you please advise me if this is correct? If not, who should the vendor be identified as?

Regards,

Thor
