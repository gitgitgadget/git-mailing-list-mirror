These are the remaining parts of my git-push refspec updates.

I recall having a hard time making sense of the existing
documentation, due to a lot of small questions that popped up.
With these patches, I try to reword things to make them clearer.

It is, however, getting to the point where I have looked at this so
much that I can no longer tell whether I am actually improving things.
Thus, this will be my last submission for this particular itch.


Cheers,
Anders.
