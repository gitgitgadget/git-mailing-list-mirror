Do have a look at the Partial Clone methods which IIUC have been
developed to align with the problem of large repos (such as Windows).
This filters the download to just those that have been selected as 'needed.

There was also, separately, some patches to IIRC keep alive connections
for places with slow internet connections.

The list archive is at https://lore.kernel.org/git/ and is relatively
easy to search.
