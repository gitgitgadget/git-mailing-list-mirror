If I may suggest something a little off the wall... the abstraction needs to go beyond just the signing tool, but the whole signing infrastructure. I would like to see something along the lines of introducing a signing authority into the mix, so that not only the tool of signing is abstracted, but also the interface to who, if anyone, is responsible for signing. If I had my dream, it would be that one (or more) signing authorities would have potentially overlapping responsibilities for signing parts of the tree either on demand or by requirement.

So when a commit occurs, at least on master, or other designated branches, it may be the repository requires a signature from a particular authority, regardless of whether the committer has requested one. And there may be more than one authority or notary involved. Or, the repository could accept the signature of the committer as abstracted.

Where I'm going is that I would like to see a tighter integration with block-chain concepts in git. My customer base has very tight requirements for this type of software certification. Signatures, GPG or other, may only go so far. I am even considering whether particular parts of the tree are even visible (remember the Islands of Sparceness discussion?).

I expect to be able to contribute more to this conversation in a few months (current $NDA prohibition), if this goes anywhere.

My feature time machine window doesn't see this any time soon, if ever, but one never knows. I have my delusional hopes. ðŸ˜‰

Please take this as simply a suggestion for the long-term.

Cheers,
Randall
