Interesting. So it seems like this is potentially a bug introduced by
9f41c7a6b, as before then passing "0" for the flags would neither commit
nor close the lockfile.

At the same time, I cannot imagine why one would want that behavior. The
only use would be if you planned to append more to the index. Which
seems kind of odd to do outside of write_locked_index() itself. And
certainly there aren't any callers in the existing codebase who pass 0.
Your assert() should help catch any that are added.
