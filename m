Christian mentioned that he talked to some GitHub folks at LinuxCon.
Those folks have also started thinking about things. :)

Things are still very tentative at this point, but I think they are
considering something like the Git Merge conference we did earlier, and
doing it in June in Europe (maybe Paris). I know they were going to
reach out to Linux Foundation folks to try to jointly plan something,
but I don't know if that has happened yet.

So it seems there are a lot of different people who are all potentially
interested in planning or taking part, and they should all be talking to
each other. :)
