I'd worry that the call in reset_revision_walk() might want to clear
non-commits if the revisions have "--objects" passed to them.

I do suspect that clearing flags from all objects would just work in the
general case (since we're limiting ourselves to only a particular set of
flags). But it's probably not worth the risk of unintended fallout,
since there's not much benefit after your series.

That's about what I'd expect. The "bad" case for looking at all objects
is when there are a bunch of objects loaded that _weren't_ part of this
particular traversal. I have no idea how often that happens, but we can
guess at the impact in the worst case: having done a previous --objects
traversal in the process and then traversing all of the commits a second
time, we'd probably have about 5-10x as many objects to look through for
that second path. So clear_commit_marks() would win there.

The absolute numbers are small enough that it probably doesn't matter
either way.
