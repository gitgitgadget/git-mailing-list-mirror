I do like this direction, because by centralizing, it's one less thing
for perf-script writers to mess up. And not only does it fix "wc -c",
but it is more friendly to any other tools (since test_size can really
be used with any scalar magnitude measurement we like; our current tests
just happen to use wc).

But...

This leaves the extra whitespace inside the test-results/foo.results
file, which is a bit unfortunate, just because anything else besides
aggregate.perl will have to do the same workaround. So we've traded one
gotcha for another. ;)

I don't have a strong opinion on which is worse. The ideal would be for
test_size() itself to handle it, though it's a bit awkward because it is
literally just redirecting the output of the test snippet into the
result file. It's probably not worth spending a ton of effort on that.

If we do go this route, it might be nice to ignore trailing whitespace,
too (I don't think it matters for wc, but just for general
friendliness). I'm tempted even to say that it should just drop the
anchors and match "\d+" anywhere, but perhaps that is a recipe for
mistakes (if somebody writes "foo 1234" we probably want to detect and
complain).
