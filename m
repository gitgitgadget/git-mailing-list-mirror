I'll pretend I was leaving that as a puzzle for the readers. :)

Right. I think the term we want here is really "basename". So in fact:

  if (!strcmp(basename(patch->new_name), GITATTRIBUTES_FILE))

would do what we want, except for the annoying caveat that basename() is
allowed to modify its parameter (to remove trailing directory
separators, but we know we wouldn't have them here).
