Our application is officially in. However, we can still edit it until
the deadline on Friday. If you have changes, feel free to make them on
the wiki page but make sure to let me know, as I have to migrate them to
the official application. I'll also probably do a once-over on Friday to
check for any updates. If only the wiki was kept in git. :)

Also, the application links to our ideas page. Please add ideas! It will
give the GSoC people a sense of what we are thinking of for projects,
and students will probably start looking at them after the list of
accepted organizations is published (which is next Friday, the 18th).
