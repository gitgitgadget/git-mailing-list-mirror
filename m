Yeah, thanks for the cheap shot.  I already understood that category=A0=
B
is subject to contempt.  Congrats on being category=A0A or C.

Turns out that "anyone" is actually "anyone accepting the conditions fo=
r
a GitHub account":

    If you wish to contribute to this website, please fork it on GitHub=
,
    push your change to a named branch, then send a pull request.

I've read the rather longish Terms&Conditions of GitHub and found mysel=
f
unwilling to agree to them.  Which does not mean that changing the ways
of contributing to the Git website to accommodate me would make any
sense since obviously I don't have a clue what a member of the "Git
community" should be proud of and ashamed of and thus would be unable t=
o
make a meaningful proposal anyway even if I were into website
programming.
