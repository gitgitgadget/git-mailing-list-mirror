Right now we have:

Dev day: 50
User day: 295
Hack day: 200

I'm not sure what the actual turnout will be, but it looks like it's
going to be pretty massive.  I wanted to go through the Dev day
signups and figure out if everyone really belongs there (is an actual
contributor to a core git project) but it's basically on the honor
system now.

If anyone on this list that should be there (Junio, Shawn, etc) wants
to attend and would like sponsorship for the flight/lodging, please
let me know.  We would love to have as many of the core people there
as possible.  I will also try to record everything and summarize as
much as I can after the fact, so if you can't attend it should still
be possible to get the general idea of what occurred and was
discussed.

I'm going to try doing something similar in the SF area in maybe 6-8
months from this, assuming it's a success.
