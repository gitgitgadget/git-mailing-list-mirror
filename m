Please send your patches inline as a single body part, as generated by
"git format-patch" (you can use git-send-email to send).

You can drop the DCO here. Your Signed-off-by line is enough.

Hrm. So this makes things consistent with git-pull, but despite the
names, push and pull are not actually opposites. Push and fetch are
opposites. And fetch does not say anything in the up-to-date case.

So I'd somewhat wonder whether we should just be making "push" less
chatty here. Still, that is a much bigger change that some people might
disagree with, and I confess I don't care overly (but nor did the
Everything/Already ever bother me either :) ).
