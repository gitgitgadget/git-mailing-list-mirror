That's interesting. When you think about it, medians are a better
measure than average because medians are robust to the outliers.

We do have timings comparing the time to compute topological levels as
compared to storing GENERATION_NUMBER_MAX in place [1]:

Writing GENERATION_NUMBER_MAX to commit-graph: 14.175s
Writing topological levels to commit-graph:    14.331s

That's around 160ms and 1% percent faster.

I do think there's a case to be made for GENERATION_NUMBER_MAX because
the performance degradation for old Git would help in faster adoption
(Junio was in favor of this, the last time we discussed alternatives [2]).
It is a double-edged sword as we force people who cannot upgrade git
into worse performance.

I do not have anything for using topological level as a tie-breaker.
Will benchmark and get back to you.
