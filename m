Before anyone asks, I'm not against changing the logo on Git Homepage,
but before that there should be a clear consensus in the community that
$logo is better than what we currently have. Also, I think we should
strive for consistency here. I think it might be actually good to have
different logo for Git itself and another for Gitweb, but they should be
graphically similar.

I quite like Henrik's logo, but I have to admit that I got rather used
to the old one. ;-) Also, one major problem I have with it is that it
has too little contrast, the colors used seem too light to me and my eye
can't find any "support" inside the logo. This is even much worse with
the favicon where the logo isn't clearly visible on the white background
at all.
