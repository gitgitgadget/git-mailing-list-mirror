True (but a few hundred bytes is nothing among friends ;-)

This is a more real issue.

You haven't told us which way you want to dedup.  Are you keeping
the original and removing the pre-parsed?  or are you only keeping
the pre-parsed ones?  As long as you want ALLOC_GROW() ability, you
need to maintain the invariants in three-tuple (foo, foo_alloc,
foo_nr).

Your feelings (or mine) do not count ;-).

I do not think we would terribly mind if you only kept a list of
pre-parsed form, with some mechanism to keep an "error" entry in
that list with its original, so that an error can be reported with
the refspec as the user originally gave us (which may mean the
"error" entry may have to keep the original form, since it wasn't
correctly parsable in the first place for it to trigger an error).

> So here is my crack at getting rid of them.

You still haven't told us what "them" are.  Parsed form, or the
original?  Let's find out by reading on....

So normally we only have a list of parsed ones, but optionally there
is a list of malformed originals that are before attempted (and
failed) parsing used for error reporting?  That sounds sensible,
especially given that we can recreate the original textual form from
correctly parsed result (which allows us to report on other kinds
of errors as necessary).

Thanks.  Will take a look (but not immediately).
