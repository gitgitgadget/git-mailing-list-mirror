How can we resolve this?

I've been using the term "command" (1) to refer to the entire lifetime
of a git command (process/instance/invocation).  Trace2 issues a series
of trace messages over that life of the process that all have a unique
id.  This allows multiple concurrent processes to write to the same
file and yet be able to associate all of the messages from a single
command instance.

I've been using the term "verb" (2) to the action -- i.e. "status" in
a "git status" command and "fetch" in a "git fetch" command.

I've been using the term "subverb" (3) to refer to the variant when
there are major differences.

What would be better choices for these 3 concepts?

Would something like "process", "command", and "mode" be better?
Or maybe "process", "command", and "command-mode"?

I'd rather not use the term "subcommand" because it already has mixed
usage.
[] See git_more_info_string[] in git.c and list_all_cmd_help()
    in help.c where both "command" and "subcommand" are used
    interchangeably.
[] And yet another completely different usage in git-submodule
    and bisect where "subcommand" is used to mean the 3rd token
    on the command line after the "command".

Suggestions?
Jeff
