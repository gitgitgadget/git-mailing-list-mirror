Hmm. When I wrote this, I was thinking of introducing equivalent options
that are identical in name and functionality as '--input=<mode>' instead
of '--<mode>'. So, I guess that is to say that I didn't spend an awful
amount of time thinking about whether or not '--input=append' made sense
given anything else.

So, I don't think that '--input=existing' is a bad idea at all, but I do
worry about advertising this deprecation as "'--<mode>' becomes
'--input=<mode>', except when your mode is 'append', in which case it
becomes '--input=existing'".

I suppose that, on the other hand, if we *were* to introduce such a
change, now would be the time to do it, before '--input=<mode>' is on
master and tagged in a release, but I'm not sure that '--input=append'
is so much worse.

I'm inclined to leave it as is, unless there are others that feel
strongly, in which case we can/should come back to it before this moves
towards being queued.
