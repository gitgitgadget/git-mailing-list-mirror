Well, I'm not necessarily _opposed_. :) Mostly my cutoff was cases where
the end result was not obviously and immediately more readable. It is
not that big a deal to add an UNUSED annotation. My main goal was to use
the opportunity to check that we aren't papering over an obvious bug.

So for example...

...in many cases things can be simplified by parsing into a string, and
then validating or acting on the string later. And sometimes that's even
a better strategy (because it lets the arg parsing handle all the "last
one wins" logic and we just get the result).

But it can also make the code harder to follow, too, because it's now
split it into segments (although one is mostly declarative, which is
nice).

So I generally tried to err on the side of not touching working
code. Both to avoid breaking it, but also to keep the focus on the goal
of the series. And I think that applies to a lot of the other cases you
mentioned below (I won't respond to each; I think some of them could be
fine, but it also feels like writing and review effort for not much
gain. I'm not opposed if you want to dig into them, though).

Yeah, that doesn't make sense at all.

Yes, I set diff.interhunkcontext=1 in my config (and have for many
years; I think this is the first time anybody noticed in a patch). My
rationale is that with "1" the output is never longer, since you save
the hunk header. It is a little funny in this case, since the two
changes aren't really connected.

I do sometimes use options like that to make a patch more readable, if I
notice the difference. I didn't happen to in this case (though I don't
disagree with you). As a reviewer, I typically apply and run "git show"
myself if I want to dig more (or just go directly look at the preimage
in my local repo, of course).

Yeah, I think the handling of "unset" is a bug (similar to the xopts one
fixed earlier).
