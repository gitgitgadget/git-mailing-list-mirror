I hate irc, too.  Number of times easily solvable usage problems
come up and I look at the log to realize when the solutions
suggested were waaaaay suboptimal it is too late (with loops
being quite active recently things have improved a lot, but we
should not expect him to be 24/7).

Maybe somebody can run a dumb 'bot that notices somebody said
something that ends with a '?' and there is no activity there
for N minutes and inject a recorded message that reminds the
mailing list address ;-).
