Actually in [1] there was also proposed another distinct approach,
namely to 'rename' the "CDAT" chunk to something else, like "CDA2"
(or proposed here "GDAT").

If I read the code correctly, with old Git if one of required chunks
is missing then Git would continue work as if commit-graph was not
present -- as opposed to current handling of unknown commit-graph
file format version number, where Git would stop working with an
error message.

That's very nice.  Thanks for investigating that.

All right.

Another advantage: we don't have to store the corrected committer date
_offset_, we can store the date (as epoch) directly.  This saves some
calculation, though a minuscule amount.

Yet another advantage: we don't need backward-compatibility for
generation number v2, i.e. corrected commit date.

Another disadvantage: we need to compute both topological levels and
corrected commit date when creating a commit-graph file or a chunk of
it.  This means that `git commit-graph write` could be slightly more
expensive.

This also means that we need to use backward-compatible generation
number v2, that is corrected commit date with strictly monotonic
offsets.  Which may lead to more cases where 30 bits for label is not
enough, and thus worse performance (no detailed reachability
information for newest commits).

CDAT chunk replaced with another chunk
======================================

In this approach the "CDAT" chunk is missing from the commit-graph file.
We can craft the replacement ("CDA2") however we like, but it can also
look like the "CDAT" chunk, only with the offsets for corrected commit
date rather than topological level for generation number part (30 bits).

If we choose to follow the "CDAT" format (modified), then the file
size would not change, and neither would change the amount of I/O
needed -- there would be the same access structure as in current
version.

There should be no confusion with a mix of v1 and v2 generation numbers.

The disadvantage is of course that older version of Git would no longer
be able to make use of serialized commit-graph if the file was written
by newer version of Git.

What is the repository where those benchmarks took place?

Nice.

How those two (or three) approaches work on gen-test [3] test cases,
both in terms of commits walked (extracted via trace2 mechanism) and
actual wall-time clock, like in the result above?

Thank you for your work.

Best,

P.S. I hope I haven't sent it twice...
