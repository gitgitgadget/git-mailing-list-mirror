Yeah. We _could_ also have the for-each function filter by name (if
present). And then quit when it finds a matching name (because it knows
the names are supposed to be unique).

That is the opposite of:

I'd be fine with that, too. I don't have a huge preference either way,
but it does feel like it would fix the weird asymmetry (though as I
said, I don't think the asymmetry is _wrong_, and it may not be worth
over-engineering this tiny corner of the interface).

Thanks for spelling out both of these directions clearly. My response to
Ã†var was a little muddled as I was having trouble figuring out just what
it was that left me so puzzled by the patch. :)


By the way, one thing I wondered about all of this: could we have an
entry in both the custom and builtin lists? I think the answer is "no",
because any custom config for a builtin type would get placed inside the
existing struct in the builtin_drivers array (which is sadly a reason we
must leak any old string values when we parse diff.*.funcname, etc; we
don't know if they are string literals or heap values from previously
parsed config).

I also notice that the "builtin" for-each does not count the boolean
"diff" or "!diff" attribute structs. That is perhaps reasonable, as they
do not have interesting names nor values in the first place. I do still
wonder whether "builtin vs custom" is even a useful distinction (i.e.,
those builtins are less builtin_drivers[] than drivers[]).
