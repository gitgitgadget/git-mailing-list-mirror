Actually this is almost exactly equivalent (except for the commit
message template) to squash merge (you lose history, that is resulting
commit have only one parent), using 'ours' merge strategy (or rather
'theirs' - which does not exist in Git).

The visualization of history would look like this:


  1<---2<----3<----4<----5<----6<----7         <--- unstable development branch
  |\              /     /
  | \--a<----b<--/     |                       <--- topic branch 1, merged in
  \                    /
   \---x<----y<----z<-/                        <--- topic branch 2, merged in


  [1]<-------------[4]<--------------[7]       <--- stable branch

where [1]^{tree} === 1^{tree}, that is the state of repository is the same


Note: I don't see how this would be better from just having a stable
branch to be a subset of development branch, that is for example:

                   /------------------------------- stable branch
                   |
                   V
  1<---2<----3<----4<----5<----6<----7         <--- unstable development branch
  |\              /     /
  | \--a<----b<--/     |                       <--- topic branch 1, merged in
  \                    /
   \---x<----y<----z<-/                        <--- topic branch 2, merged in

Well, this does not change my reasoning in any way.

If there is problem with developers running tests (or at least running
them comprehensively, that is for all architectures / subsystems), why
not set up a continuous integration / continuous delivery server, that
would run all the tests after push?

I have not used Visual SourceSafe myself (though I tried to use CVS
in times before Git), but I have heard horror stories about it...

As to mastering Git - I recommend "Pro Git" (free on-line book),
"Git for Teams" (though more about teams than about Git), or my
"Mastering Git" book.

For beginners, there is "Version Control By Example" (free online
version), or "Git: Version Control for Everyone".

What the setup looks like?  Is there a central repository where everyone
publish their changes, or is there one person responsible for integrating
changes from each developer public repository?

That looks like abuse of the DAG of revisions...

Anyway, even if you don't have the access to individual topic
branches, and everybody uses single central repository, merging their
changes into development branch, you can still select a subset
of development-merged topic branches to merge into stable branch.

I'll try to explain it on pictures (note: ASCII-art requires
fixed width font, and preserving spaces).

Let's assume that there are two topic branches merged into
development branch (and there are no commits made directly on
the development branch):


  1<---------------2<----3        <--- unstable development branch
  |\              /     /
  | \--a<----b<--/     |          <--- topic branch 1, merged in
  \                    /
   \---x<----y<----z<-/           <--- topic branch 2, merged in

Now, you can be conservative, and say that only topic 1 is ready
to be in the stable branch

  1<---------------2              <--- stable branch
   \              /     
    \--a<----b<--/                <--- topic branch 1, merged in

Here 'stable' is subset of 'development'.

It might turn out that topic branch 1 was prematurely merged, and
is not yet ready for stable.  You could revert a merge (though
troubles lies ahead here), but you can simply select only topic
branch 2 for stable:

  1<---------------------Î²        <--- stable branch
  |                     /
  |                    |
  \                    /
   \---x<----y<----z<-/           <--- topic branch 2, merged in

This is simply not possible in your approach.

That is what git.git does (see e.g. "A note from the maintainer"
https://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/a-note-from-maintainer.html).

I'm sorry, it was my mistake.  Cherry-picking is different: it is used
to "copy" changes as a commit (copy a commit in a sense of copying changes
and the commit message).  Though git-cherry-pick can add a hash of an
original commit to the commit message of a commit created by cherry-pick.

That's the problem.  Sparse "stable" means that if you do git-bisect on
stable, you would land on large commit, with huge changes and probably
not descriptive commit message.  I other words: not that useful.
