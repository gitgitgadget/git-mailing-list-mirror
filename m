Sorry, I personally consider it is not a very high priority; the
above is a typo (otherwise "but agrees" does not make _any_
sense).

The rest of the message I'll find a time to comment on
separately, but I am in the middle of migrating the development
environment, so it might take some time.

Oh, and please send patches cc'ed to the list at least for a few
days, because I am fighting with fetchmail/getmail configuration
right now and might lose a few mails while doing so.
