Hi Elijah,
Many thanks.. personal notes in-line.

neat

as per the comment, this is 1 less than a nice prime 107927 that fits
17bits.
Some discussions at
https://lore.kernel.org/git/7vwtezt202.fsf@assigned-by-dhcp.cox.net/ and
surrounding  messages.

The hash is very similar to a CRC, a rotating 64bit value, using 7 bit
shifts and a 8bit char addition, then reduced to a hash computed at ~#L157

I was surprised to see that I'd been in the area at #L162 ;-)

Thank you for the useful summary.

Nice point about the hashes only being computed once.

Thanks again.
