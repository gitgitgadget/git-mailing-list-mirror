And yet you trash the results.

Not everybody likes getting the kind of treatment you find fit to dish
out.

And you wonder that people are unwilling to ask for things on the
list?  When even mentioning something in a _survey_ makes core
developers want to bang their heads against a wall?

I find it a pity that my suggestion to ask about how comfortable
people are with the tone on the list did not make it into the survey.
Enough core developers make the tone sufficiently unconstructive to
make it quite understandable that people are unwilling to ask
questions here, in order to avoid getting their heads banged against a
wall, virtual or not.
