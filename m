I did not because I felt anything other than the following three
would be just adding noise to already high traffic:

 (1) "I am the vger.kernel.org list maintainer and I will create
     one".

 (2) "I do not have enough time to keep up with git list but I
     want to get only announce -- count me in please".

 (3) "It is not a good idea because...".

and whatever I would have said would not have been any of the
above.
