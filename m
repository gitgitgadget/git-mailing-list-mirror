Noobie here...Don't ask why, but I have essentially 3 branches in separate
code bases on my file system that aren't in a repository right now.  

I would like to turn this into a git repository.  One branch being master,
the second develop and finally a third branch that is extended off the
develop branch.

Is there a way to do this?  Could someone give me a step by step?  I am
having a hard enough time just getting use to git and I am lost trying to
figure this out.

thanks so much
