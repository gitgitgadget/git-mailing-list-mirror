This patch series implements the corrected commit date offsets as generation
number v2, along with other pre-requisites.

Git uses topological levels in the commit-graph file for commit-graph
traversal operations like 'git log --graph'. Unfortunately, using
topological levels can result in a worse performance than without them when
compared with committer date as a heuristics. For example, 'git merge-base
v4.8 v4.9' on the Linux repository walks 635,579 commits using topological
levels and walks 167,468 using committer date. Since 091f4cf3 (commit: don't
use generation numbers if not needed, 2018-08-30), 'git merge-base' uses
committer date heuristic unless there is a cutoff because of the performance
hit.

Thus, the need for generation number v2 was born. New generation number
needed to provide good performance, increment updates, and backward
compatibility. Due to an unfortunate problem [1], we also needed a way to
distinguish between the old and new generation number without incrementing
graph version.

[1] https://public-inbox.org/git/87a7gdspo4.fsf@evledraar.gmail.com/

Various candidates were examined (https://github.com/derrickstolee/gen-test,
https://github.com/abhishekkumar2718/git/pull/1). The proposed generation
number v2, Corrected Commit Date with Mononotically Increasing Offsets
performed much worse than committer date (506,577 vs. 167,468 commits walked
for 'git merge-base v4.8 v4.9') and was dropped.

Using Generation Data chunk (GDAT) relieves the requirement of backward
compatibility as we would continue to store topological levels in Commit
Data (CDAT) chunk. Thus, Corrected Commit Date was chosen as generation
number v2. The Corrected Commit Date is defined as follows:

For a commit C, let its corrected commit date be the maximum of the commit
date of C and the corrected commit dates of its parents plus 1. Then
corrected commit date offset is the difference between corrected commit date
of C and commit date of C. As a special case, a root commit with the
timestamp zero has corrected commit date of 1 to be able to distinguish it
from GENERATION_NUMBER_ZERO (that is, an uncomputed corrected commit date).

We will introduce an additional commit-graph chunk, Generation DATa (GDAT)
chunk, and store corrected commit date offsets in GDAT chunk while storing
topological levels in CDAT chunk. The old versions of Git would ignore GDAT
chunk, using topological levels from CDAT chunk. In contrast, new versions
of Git would use corrected commit dates, falling back to topological level
if the generation data chunk is absent in the commit-graph file.

While storing corrected commit date offsets saves us 4 bytes per commit (as
compared with storing corrected commit dates directly), it's however
possible for the offset to overflow the space allocated. To handle such
cases, we introduce a new chunk, Generation Data Overflow (GDOV) that stores
the corrected commit date. For overflowing offsets, we set MSB and store the
position into the GDOV chunk, in a mechanism similar to the Extra Edges list
chunk.

For mixed generation number environment (for example new Git on the command
line, old Git used by GUI client), we can encounter a mixed-chain
commit-graph (a commit-graph chain where some of split commit-graph files
have GDAT chunk and others do not). As backward compatibility is one of the
goals, we can define the following behavior:

While reading a mixed-chain commit-graph version, we fall back on
topological levels as corrected commit dates and topological levels cannot
be compared directly.

When adding new layer to the split commit-graph file, and when merging some
or all layers (replacing them in the latter case), the new layer will have
GDAT chunk if and only if in the final result there would be no layer
without GDAT chunk just below it.

Thanks to Dr. Stolee, Dr. NarÄ™bski, and Taylor for their reviews.

I look forward to everyone's reviews!

Thanks

 * Abhishek

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Improvements left for a future series:

 * Save commits with generation data overflow and extra edge commits instead
   of looping over all commits. cf. 858sbel67n.fsf@gmail.com
 * Verify both topological levels and corrected commit dates when present.
   cf. 85pn4tnk8u.fsf@gmail.com

Changes in version 5:

 * Explained a possible reason for no change in performance for
   "commit-graph: fix regression when computing bloom-filters"
 * Clarified about the addition of a new test for 11-digit octal
   implementations of ustar.
 * Fixed duplicate test names in "commit-graph: consolidate
   fill_commit_graph_info".
 * Swapped the order "commit-graph: return 64-bit generation number",
   "commit-graph: add a slab to store topological levels" to minimize lines
   changed.
 * Fixed the mismerge in "commit-graph: return 64-bit generation number"
 * Clarified the preparatory steps are for the larger goal of implementing
   generation number v2 in "commit-graph: return 64-bit generation number".
 * Moved the rename of "run_three_modes()" to "run_all_modes()" into a new
   patch "t6600-test-reach: generalize *_three_modes".
 * Explained and removed the checks for GENERATION_NUMBER_INFINITY that can
   never be true in "commit-graph: add a slab to store topological levels".
 * Fixed incorrect logic for verifying commit-graph in "commit-graph:
   implement corrected commit date".
 * Added minor improvements to commit message of "commit-graph: implement
   generation data chunk".
 * Added '--date ' option to test_commit() in 'test-lib-functions.sh' in
   "commit-graph: implement generation data chunk".
 * Improved coding style (also in tests) for "commit-graph: use generation
   v2 only if entire chain does".
 * Simplified test repository structure in "commit-graph: use generation v2
   only if entire chain does" as only the number of commits in a split
   commit-graph layer are relevant.
 * Added a new test in "commit-graph: use generation v2 only if entire chain
   does" to check if the layers are merged correctly.
 * Explicitly mentioned commit "091f4cf3" in the commit-message of
   "commit-graph: use corrected commit dates in paint_down_to_common()".
 * Minor corrections to documentation in "doc: add corrected commit date
   info".
 * Minor corrections to coding style.

Changes in version 4:

 * Added GDOV to handle overflows in generation data.

   Documentation/technical/commit-graph-format.txt
 * Reverted unimportant whitespace, style changes in commit-graph.c
 * Added header comments about the order of comparision for
   compare_commits_by_gen_then_commit_date in commit.h,
   compare_commits_by_gen in commit-graph.h
 * Elaborated on why t6404 fails with corrected commit date and must be run
   with GIT_TEST_COMMIT_GRAPH=1in the commit "commit-reach: use corrected
   commit dates in paint_down_to_common()"
 * Elaborated on write behavior for mixed generation number chains in the
   commit "commit-graph: use generation v2 only if entire chain does"
 * Added notes about adding the topo_level slab to struct
   write_commit_graph_context as well as struct commit_graph.
 * Clarified commit message for "commit-graph: consolidate
   fill_commit_graph_info"
 * Removed the claim "GDAT can store future generation numbers" because it
   hasn't been tested yet.

Changes in version 3:

 * Reordered patches as discussed in 2
   [https://lore.kernel.org/git/aee0ae56-3395-6848-d573-27a318d72755@gmail.com/].
 * Split "implement corrected commit date" into two patches - one
   introducing the topo level slab and other implementing corrected commit
   dates.
 * Extended split-commit-graph tests to verify at the end of test.
 * Use topological levels as generation number if any of split commit-graph
   files do not have generation data chunk.

Changes in version 2:

     -    commit_gen_cmp is used when writing a commit-graph to sort commits in
     -    generation order before computing Bloom filters. Since c49c82aa (commit:
     -    move members graph_pos, generation to a slab, 2020-06-17) made it so
     -    that 'commit_graph_generation()' returns 'GENERATION_NUMBER_INFINITY'
     -    during writing, we cannot call it within this function. Instead, access
     -    the generation number directly through the slab (i.e., by calling
     -    'commit_graph_data_at(c)->generation') in order to access it while
     -    writing.
     +    Before computing Bloom fitlers, the commit-graph machinery uses
     +    commit_gen_cmp to sort commits by generation order for improved diff
     +    performance. 3d11275505 (commit-graph: examine commits by generation
     +    number, 2020-03-30) claims that this sort can reduce the time spent to
     +    compute Bloom filters by nearly half.
      
     -    While measuring performance with `git commit-graph write --reachable
     -    --changed-paths` on the linux repository led to around 1m40s for both
     -    HEAD and master (and could be due to fault in my measurements), it is
     -    still the "right" thing to do.
     +    But since c49c82aa4c (commit: move members graph_pos, generation to a
     +    slab, 2020-06-17), this optimization is broken, since asking for a
     +    'commit_graph_generation()' directly returns GENERATION_NUMBER_INFINITY
     +    while writing.
     +
     +    Not all hope is lost, though: 'commit_graph_generation()' falls back to
     +    comparing commits by their date when they have equal generation number,
     +    and so since c49c82aa4c is purely a date comparision function. This
     +    heuristic is good enough that we don't seem to loose appreciable
     +    performance while computing Bloom filters. Applying this patch (compared
     +    with v2.29.1) speeds up computing Bloom filters by around ~4
     +    seconds.
     +
     +    So, avoid the useless 'commit_graph_generation()' while writing by
     +    instead accessing the slab directly. This returns the newly-computed
     +    generation numbers, and allows us to avoid the heuristic by directly
     +    comparing generation numbers.

          commit-graph: add a slab to store topological levels
      
          In a later commit we will introduce corrected commit date as the
     -    generation number v2. This value will be stored in the new seperate
     -    Generation Data chunk. However, to ensure backwards compatibility with
     -    "Old" Git we need to continue to write generation number v1, which is
     -    topological level, to the commit data chunk. This means that we need to
     -    compute both versions of generation numbers when writing the
     -    commit-graph file. Therefore, let's introduce a commit-slab to store
     +    generation number v2. Corrected commit dates will be stored in the new
     +    seperate Generation Data chunk. However, to ensure backwards
     +    compatibility with "Old" Git we need to continue to write generation
     +    number v1 (topological levels) to the commit data chunk. Thus, we need
     +    to compute and store both versions of generation numbers to write the
     +    commit-graph file.
     +
     +    Therefore, let's introduce a commit-slab `topo_level_slab` to store
          topological levels; corrected commit date will be stored in the member
          `generation` of struct commit_graph_data.
      
     -    When Git creates a split commit-graph, it takes advantage of the
     -    generation values that have been computed already and present in
     -    existing commit-graph files.
     +    The macros `GENERATION_NUMBER_INFINITY` and `GENERATION_NUMBER_ZERO`
     +    mark commits not in the commit-graph file and commits written by a
     +    version of Git that did not compute generation numbers respectively.
     +    Generation numbers are computed identically for both kinds of commits.
     +
     +    A "slab-miss" should return `GENERATION_NUMBER_INFINITY` as the commit
     +    is not in the commit-graph file. However, since the slab is
     +    zero-initialized, it returns 0 (or rather `GENERATION_NUMBER_ZERO`).
     +    Thus, we no longer need to check if the topological level of a commit is
     +    `GENERATION_NUMBER_INFINITY`.
      
     -    So, let's add a pointer to struct commit_graph as well as struct
     -    write_commit_graph_context to the topological level commit-slab
     -    and populate it with topological levels while writing a commit-graph
     -    file.
     +    We will add a pointer to the slab in `struct write_commit_graph_context`
     +    and `struct commit_graph` to populate the slab in
     +    `fill_commit_graph_info` if the commit has a pre-computed topological
     +    level as in case of split commit-graphs.

     -    Because of the current use of inspecting the current layer for a
     -    chunk_generation_data pointer, the commits in the lower layer will be
     -    interpreted as having very large generation values (commit date plus
     -    offset) compared to the generation numbers in the top layer (topological
     -    level). This violates the expectation that the generation of a parent is
     -    strictly smaller than the generation of a child.
     +    If each layer of split commit-graph is treated independently, as it was
     +    the case before this commit, with Git inspecting only the current layer
     +    for chunk_generation_data pointer, commits in the lower layer (one with
     +    GDAT) whould have corrected commit date as their generation number,
     +    while commits in the upper layer would have topological levels as their
     +    generation. Corrected commit dates usually have much larger values than
     +    topological levels. This means that if we take two commits, one from the
     +    upper layer, and one reachable from it in the lower layer, then the
     +    expectation that the generation of a parent is smaller than the
     +    generation of a child would be violated.
      
          It is difficult to expose this issue in a test. Since we _start_ with
          artificially low generation numbers, any commit walk that prioritizes

          anything to output (depending on the size of the upper layer).
      
     -    When writing the new layer in split commit-graph, we write a GDAT chunk
     -    only if the topmost layer has a GDAT chunk. This guarantees that if a
     -    layer has GDAT chunk, all lower layers must have a GDAT chunk as well.
     +    Therefore, When writing the new layer in split commit-graph, we write a

          commit-reach: use corrected commit dates in paint_down_to_common()
      
     -    With corrected commit dates implemented, we no longer have to rely on
     -    commit date as a heuristic in paint_down_to_common().
     +    091f4cf (commit: don't use generation numbers if not needed,
     +    2018-08-30) changed paint_down_to_common() to use commit dates instead
     +    of generation numbers v1 (topological levels) as the performance
     +    regressed on certain topologies. With generation number v2 (corrected
     +    commit dates) implemented, we no longer have to rely on commit dates and
     +    can use generation numbers.
      
     -    While using corrected commit dates Git walks nearly the same number of
     +    For example, the command `git merge-base v4.8 v4.9` on the Linux
     +    repository walks 167468 commits, taking 0.135s for committer date and
     +    167496 commits, taking 0.157s for corrected committer date respectively.
     +
     +    While using corrected commit dates, Git walks nearly the same number of
          commits as commit date, the process is slower as for each comparision we
          have to access a commit-slab (for corrected committer date) instead of
          accessing struct member (for committer date).
      
     -    For example, the command `git merge-base v4.8 v4.9` on the linux
     -    repository walks 167468 commits, taking 0.135s for committer date and
     -    167496 commits, taking 0.157s for corrected committer date respectively.
     -
     -    t6404-recursive-merge setups a unique repository where all commits have
     -    the same committer date without well-defined merge-base.
     +    This change incidentally broke the fragile t6404-recursive-merge test.
     +    t6404-recursive-merge sets up a unique repository where all commits have
     +    the same committer date without a well-defined merge-base.
      
          While running tests with GIT_TEST_COMMIT_GRAPH unset, we use committer
          date as a heuristic in paint_down_to_common(). 6404.1 'combined merge
          conflicts' merges commits in the order:
     -    - Merge C with B to form a intermediate commit.
     +    - Merge C with B to form an intermediate commit.
          - Merge the intermediate commit with A.
      
          With GIT_TEST_COMMIT_GRAPH=1, we write a commit-graph and subsequently
          use the corrected committer date, which changes the order in which
          commits are merged:
     -    - Merge A with B to form a intermediate commit.
     +    - Merge A with B to form an intermediate commit.
          - Merge the intermediate commit with C.
