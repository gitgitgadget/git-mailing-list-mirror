I think that is the author-date generated by format-patch, since that's
when I originally wrote it. I generally format the messages into an
mbox, load that in mutt, and then use mutt's "bounce" feature to send
them, which rewrites the date header. In this case, though, I somehow
accidentally hit "reply" (more astounding is that I didn't notice it as
I was sending; I think I might be getting senile).

I suspected that, too, but when I checked I couldn't find any instance
where we do. I might not have looked hard enough, or perhaps whoever
converted the pack code had better taste than me (see the similar use of
object_id in the previous patch).

Yep, see my reply. :)
