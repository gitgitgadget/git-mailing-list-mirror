My logic was that as we handle commits here it would make sense to 
handle tags as well - I discovered that this did not work when I 
happened to use an annotated tag as the <branch> argument to rebase the 
commits pointed to by the tag and was surprised it did not work when we 
happily accept tags for <upstream> and --onto.

As far as I can tell we have never peeled tags here

I wrote this patch as I felt it was an artificial distinction to require 
that <branch> is a branch-ish thing rather than a commit-ish thing. 
Rebase already peels <upstream> and --onto so it feels inconsistent not 
to do it for <branch>. I guess the counter argument to that is users may 
be confused and start complaining that the tag itself is not rebased.

No "--onto <tag>" works fine. We also accept a tag object for upstream 
without requiring the user to peel it for us.

We could do that if we're worried that users would be confused by the 
tag not being rebased if we started automatically peeling <branch>. (I'm 
kind of leaning in that direction at the moment having read your email)
