I think it also probably doesn't test what the patch adding these tests
was interested in. Specifically, it's trying to check the case of
reporting the pager exit code while we're in a signal handler. So we
have to get the SIGPIPE in the main git process to trigger that. Which
means it has to be a builtin.

So you really do need a builtin that produces infinite output. Or at the
very least, enough that we expect it to fill any possible OS pipe
buffer. I guess the latter is actually not that hard. A 1MB
commit-message would be plenty (or if you prefer, a big file with "log
-p").
