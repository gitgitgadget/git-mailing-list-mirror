What it sounds like you are doing is piping a 'git fast-import' process into
reposurgeon, and testing that reposurgeon does the same thing every time.
Of course this won't be consistent if 'git fast-import' isn't consistent.

But what you should do instead is store a fixed file from one run of
'git fast-import' and send that file to reposurgeon for the repeated test.
Don't rely on fast-import being consistent and instead use fixed input for
your test.

If reposurgeon is providing the input to _and_ consuming the output from
'git fast-import', then yes you will need to have at least one integration
test that runs the full pipeline. But for regression tests covering complicated
logic in reposurgeon, you're better off splitting the test (or mocking out
'git fast-import' with something that provides consistent output given
fixed input).
