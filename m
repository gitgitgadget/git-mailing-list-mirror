Yeah. In a world where every failing function returned the equivalent of
-errno, you could just do:

  ret = xread(fd, ...); /* actually returns -errno! */
  if (ret < 0) {
	close(fd);
	return ret; /* open's errno preserved via ret */
  }

We could live in that world if we wrapped all of the syscalls with
xread(), etc, that behaved that way. I don't know if it would run into
weird gotchas, though, or if the result would simply look foreign to
most POSIX/C programmers.

I also wonder if it might end up having the same 1% overhead that the
free() checks did, as it involves more juggling of stack values.

True. It's one more weird thing to remember, but for the most part we
are there already with xmalloc().

Heh, I actually meant to say getdelim(), which obviously is closely
related. There's only one call to it, but as it underlies
strbuf_getwholeline(), many strbufs will use it.

And as you might have guessed, my "amazing foresight" came from being
bitten by the same thing already. ;) Annoyed at how long git took to run
a large workload under massif, I once wrote a hacky peak-heap profiler
that wraps the system malloc(). Naturally it needs to match frees to
their original allocations so we know how big each one was. Imagine my
surprise when I saw many frees without a matching allocation.

That's a mouthful, for sure. I think it is OK to suggest they are
related as long as there is a comment in xfree() mentioning that we
might see pointers that didn't come from our x*() functions. That's
where somebody would have to add code that violates the assumption.

I don't see a way either. I'd be willing to consider the 0-1% slowdown
if it buys us simplicity, though. I'm also not even sure it's real.
There seemed to be a fairly large variation in results, and switching my
powersaving functions around got me cases where the new code was
actually faster. If we think there's a real benefit, we should make sure
the costs aren't just illusory.
