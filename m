Yes, generated headers, but no, not more general. ;-)

I originally included those headers directly in the
EXCEPT_HDRS macro, along with the list of excluded
directories (which was much longer at one point).

The 'command-list.h' is generated as part of the build
(and so may or may not be part of the LIB_H macro), whereas
the unicode-width.h header is only re-generated when someone
runs the 'contrib/update-unicode/update_unicode.sh' script
(presumably when a new standard version is announced) and
commits the result.

Both headers fail the 'hdr-check', although both generator
scripts could be 'fixed' so that they passed. I just didn't
think it was worth the effort - neither header was likely
to be #included anywhere else. I guess I could eliminate
that macro, absorbing it into EXCEPT_HDRS, if that would
lead to less confusion ...

[I suspect the fact that LIB_H (almost always) contains
'command-list.h' has not been noticed ... :-P ]

Hmm, GENERATED_H seems only to be used by the i18n part of the
makefile and, as a result of its appearance in LIB_H, sometimes
results in command-list.h appearing twice in LOCALIZED_C.
(which is probably not a problem).
