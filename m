Hi,

as some of you already know, I will be unable to Git Together with other 
Gits in California this year.  So the only version of such a Git Together 
I will have this year is the Berlin one.

Details: it will take place on October 3rd, 2009, at the Zuse-Institut 
Berlin: http://www.zib.de/besucher/index.en.html (graciously offered by 
Steffen Prohaska).

We will have a room with fast internet connection and a beamer.

As for the schedule: I had something like this in mind:

10:00 Saying hello to everybody
10:30 Dscho says something about the history of msysGit
11:00 Somebody else talks about something else
11:30 ...
...

After the talks, maybe a little hackathon-style coding (I know what I 
would like to implement, but let's just see what happens).

In the evening, we probably order pizza or go to a restaurant nearby.

Ciao,
Dscho
