The primary assumption of the survey seems to be that the responder is already 
using git.  What about some questions for people _not_ using git; things like 
(badly written I'm sure, but you get the idea):

Not using GIT

  Have you heard of git?  i.e. do you know what it's for?
  Do you already use a VCS?  Which one?  Are you happy with it?
  If not, would you like to use a VCS?
  If you don't use a VCS already and don't want to - why not?
  If you do use a VCS already, but it's not git - why not?
  Would you like to use git but git doesn't supply a feature you need?
  What would you require from git to enable you to change?

"extatic" should be "ecstatic"
