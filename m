I think it's because I'm an idiot. I must have only been using 2.0.0
when I was looking at the XML output manually (for the refmiscinfo
lines), and never actually rendered it to roff. I get the same problem
when I try a full build.

That seems like a bug in asciidoctor, which ought to be quoting the "<".
We certainly can't quote it ourselves (we don't even know that our
backend output is going to a format that needs angle brackets quoted).
