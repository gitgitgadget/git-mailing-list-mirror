Yes, I was thinking that I was confronted by these things more in Vista
on a desktop, but can't remember exactly.  A lot of the directories are
symbolic links that can't be clicked!  I'm running Windows 2003 which I
think is based on the Vista core, but doesn't have the flashy UI candy,
for servers.

But, you would not see more clutter if it was in the place where your
APPDATA environment variable points, right?
