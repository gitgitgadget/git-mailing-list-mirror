Hi everyone,

It looks like there will be no Git conference or Git developer meeting
this year.

Anyway, next year Git will be 10 years old and it would be nice if
something could be organized.

A few week ago, I was at the LinuxCon North America in Chicago [1]. I
love going to a LinuxCon and giving a presentation there. It was my
4th LinuxCon (2 in Europe and 2 in North America) and they are always
very well organized. They also often host other open source/free
software conferences like for Mesos [2] or Gstreamer [3].

So I wonder if we could officially ask if they could host and help
organize a Git conference next year.

In fact I already discussed this with a few of the LinuxFoundation
people at the LinuxCon and they looked happy with that. I also talked
with a few Github guys there who were also happy with that.

Github was a gold sponsor of the LinuxCon as well as Google [1], and
Atlassian was a platinum sponsor of the co-located MesosCon [2]. So it
looks like many companies involved with Git like the LinuxFoundation
and already collaborate with it.

At the LinuxCon they said that the next LinuxCon North America is
planned for August 2015 in Seattle. Seattle is a not very far away
from were Junio, Shawn and Linus live, and Linus usually comes to the
LinuxCon North America, so I suppose that it would not be a big burden
for them to come if they want to.

As many Linux kernel developers have been contributing to Git,
especially at the beginning, which was very important for the success
of Git, I think it would be nice if some of them could easily take
part of a Git conference where we would celebrate the 10th anniversary
of Git.

To sum up it would be a very nice common ground for both companies and
developers, and it would be much easier to organize with the great
help and experience of the LinuxFoundation.

Best,
Christian.
