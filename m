Yeah, the mis-matched title-and-dashes thing has bitten us several
times. I think this one just post-dates the last round of fixing.

The "somehow" here is that the mismatched dashes appear to be the start
of a code listing block, making the whole example section into one big
listing (which isn't properly closed, generating a warning).

And that's why in the context:

We _don't_ need to match up the dashes for "Format data...". That is
meant to be a listing block (and arguably should use a shorter string of
dashes to make that intent more obvious).
