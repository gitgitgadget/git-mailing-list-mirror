Agreed.

If fstat() fails then there is clearly something wrong and the filter
should fail.

This function would have almost the same signature as apply_protocol2_filter
and therefore I would say it's not worth it since the function is not
crazy long.

Very good question. You are right... we don't want to ignore any errors
during the protocol... I will remove it.

OK, I change it to goto error handling style.

Maybe... but I think that would make it harder to understand the protocol. I
think I would prefer to have all the communication in one function layer.

Correct.

Correct. And therefore I would prefer not to change this in this series.

Yes, a wrapper makes it way cleaner!

No binary file. The main reason for this test is to check multiple files.
I'll add a empty file. A large file is tested in the next test.

Well, the clean invocations (and therefore their order of appearance)
are not deterministic. See my discussion with Junio here:

Yes, because the smudge calls are deterministic!

I am not sure what you mean?!

Easy enough to check. I will add this.

True. Isn't that what the test description indicates?

rot13.sh is generated in the header of the file.
rot13-filter.pl is part of the test suite

Only the clean one shot filter is configured. Therefore that shouldn't be a
problem, right?

True, but since they fail hard it is easier to check.

True.

No, with reject a filter can say "I don't want to process that file". This is a legitimate
response and I don't Git to restart the filter in that case.

I would like to keep it that way for readability since
the test script also serves as example implementation.
