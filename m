It's a pity that you did not announce the event on the msysgit mailing 
list, too, which is why I totally missed it until today, the event being 
almost over. This is especially sad for me as I'm living in Berlin, so 
it would have been easy for me to attend, and as I had offered to help 
you organizing the event when you were still looking for a location last 
year.
