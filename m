It appears that config.c:do_git_config_sequence() passes flags = 0
to access_or_die() rather than ACCESS_EACCES_OK as it does for the
other scopes.  This causes the fatal error, rather than ignoring the
problem.

Reasons for this were discussed in:
     4698c8feb1 config: allow inaccessible configuration under $HOME

I'll push a fix shortly.

Thanks
