First, keyword expansion on checkout (CVS-like) is an abomination;
the proper way is to do it on _build_ time, like git and Linux kernel
do, so "git version" (or "git --version") and "uname -a" gives us
the version which can be used with git to go to it.

Second, there were some work on git mailing list to create git command
which given a blob (or sha1 of a blob object) would list all commits
(in date order) which have this exact version of a file (of a blob).

Third, tar files generated by git-acrhive have version embedded as
a comment in them.
