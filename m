Folks, its that time of year again.  We need to apply to be a
mentoring organization for Google Summer of Code 2009.

Deadline is this Friday around noon PST.

I have updated the application document on the wiki with the
current questions and more up-to-date answers:

  http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/SoC2009Application

Please make any comments in the next day or so, so that we can
address them and have time to upload the completed application
before their cut-off deadline.

Shawn.
