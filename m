=46unnily enough, he chose to title it the "Git Community Book". Hard t=
o =20
match Scott's enthusiasm; this is the second major initiative we've =20
seen from him in the last few days (the other being git-scm.com =20
itself) which to the casual onlooker might look like the "official" =20
Git homepage and documentation, but in both cases development occurred =
=20
behind the scenes and the list was only notified after the fact. =20
Better late than never I suppose.

Even though there might not be an automated way to get changes back =20
from the fork, if there are clear improvements made then there is at =20
least no legal obstacle to incorporating them back in, the only =20
obstacle would be time and willingness to do so manually.
