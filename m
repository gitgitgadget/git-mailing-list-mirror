I really enjoyed this talk, which was in a weird sense very encouraging.

By the way, one thing David talked about that is not in the PDF slides but
I found quite good to stress was the importance of good commit messages.
"Write in present tense, it will read much nicer and you'll appreciate it
after reading hundreds of them".

I'd actually say "imperative mood" instead of "present tense" (but they
look almost always the same in English), but in any case, it really gets
on my nerve to read commit message that talks things in past tense and I
often end up rewriting other people's commit log messages.
