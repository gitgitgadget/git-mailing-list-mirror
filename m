Please back it out.  As it stands, that patch is a no op because of the 
way git is used, and even if the patch was to work as intended, its 
purpose is not to magically fix corruptions without special action from 
your part.  If you have corruption problems coming back only because of 
the removal of this patch then something is really really fishy and I 
would really like to know about it.

There were indeed many changes between v1.6.0.4 and v1.6.1: the exact 
number is 1029.  A couple of them are especially addressing increased 
robustness against some kind of pack corruptions.  But in any case you 
still should see error messages appearing about them.

And don't underestimate the power of disk corruptions.  I started to 
work on git corruption resilience simply because I ended up with a 
corrupted pack at some point.  Then a while later I got another 
corrupted pack.  Then another while later I lost my filesystem entirely 
and had to reinstall my system (after buying a new disk).  Turns out 
that my old disk is silently corrupting data without signaling any 
errors to the host.
