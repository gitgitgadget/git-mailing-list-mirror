This is the much truncated (was 0/13] and updated series for
noting that 'git help' can display the existing guides that are
formatted as man pages, and providing a 'git help' option to list
a few of the most useful guides.

The series is rebased on top of V1.8.2-rc1

Differences relative to V1 numbering
Patch 1: Use 'Git' in help messages
Dropped.
a. the 'git version' string is used in the wild for version checking,
in particular Git Gui checks the string is 'git version'.
b. a recent patch series fixed on lower case messages for 'usage:',
respect that.
c. many consider that the 'git' reference was to the 'git <cmd>' format
rather than (the system) Git's commands.

Patch 2 (now 1/5): Show 'git help <guide>' usage, with examples
Correct elipsis dots for unterminated list of examples.

Patch 2 (now 2/5): Help.c use OPT_COUNTUP
Unchanged.

Patch 4 (now 3/5): Help.c add --guide option
Update commit message to explain the -g|--guide logic.

Patch 5 (now 4/5): Help.c: add list_common_guides_help() function
Removed the 'build artefact' /* */ comment line.
Note that these are just the common guides and used in a usage message.
The data was generated by a script variant of generate-cmdlist.sh

Patch (new 5/5): Help doc: Include --guide option description
Update the documentation/git-help.txt - I had been caught out by
the same 'focus on the code' mistake made by many and forgot
the documenation ;-)

Patch 6 - 13: 
All dropped.
Drop the separate guide list.txt and extraction script, which was
copied from the common command list and script. If the guide usage
list is useful, extend the command-list.txt and generate-cmdlist.sh
at a later date.

Drop the rename of user-manual and everyday because they are not
formatted as manuals. They can't be started by help's call to 'man'
(and possibly other paths) anyway.
