Dear GSoC students, dear mentors, dear Git list,

we have all gathered here to participate in the last sprint of the Google 
Summer of Code.  A lot has happened during all that time.  The Git 
community has seen "fresh meat", and there may have been a few being 
reminded of their first or second steps in Open Source looking back with a 
bit of envy.

We saw some of you students prosper from the hands-on discussions with a 
few of the brightest minds that Open Source has to offer.

We have seen good work, we have seen excellent work, but also work that 
does not fall into these categories, and also work that was not done.

As you might know, the week between the 11th of August and the 18th of 
same month is the week when the mentors have to give their evaluations 
about their students' work.  The mentors are not allowed to base their 
evaluations on anything that might come after the deadline, but only on 
work completed by that time.

Now, dear students: it is not necessary to have all your work merged into 
git.git yet; indeed, the 1.6.0 release cycle is on, and you can hope at 
most for 'next', but not 'master'.

However, in order to hope for a good evaluation, it is necessary to have 
at least something that comes _close_ to being mergeable.

Dear mentors, now I come to you.  Please make sure that you work with your 
students during those last days of the project, and help them reach their 
goal.

And when it comes to the evaluations, be honest: Google is extremely 
generous to provide us with funding for our students, but the students 
have to earn it.  Every dollar that is spent undeservedly will be a dollar 
that is not given to other, more worthy Open Source activities.

To all of you who are neither GSoC students nor GSoC mentors: please help 
by reviewing and encouraging.

With those thoughts in mind, I wish us all a fun and frantic last days of 
the GSoC project, and I look forward to see you all even after the Summer 
has ended.

Ciao,
Dscho
