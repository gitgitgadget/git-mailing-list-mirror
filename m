Yeah, I agree it is probably worth mentioning in git-config(1).

That seems like the most sensible place, as that is where we should
cover the order of reading and precedence. Perhaps FILES should be
renamed to SOURCES or something (though I do not recall if we are
restricted to "usual" manpage section names or not).

Arguably this is not about git-config the program at all, but the
general concept of "configuration for git", because the precedence rules
apply equally to all of the git programs that read config. So it _could_
be pulled out into its own gitconfig(7) page. That's a lot more work,
though, and I don't blame you if you want to start with a more minor
update.

(I also think that having both git-config(1) and gitconfig(7) may be
confusing; "git help revisions" knows to find gitrevisions(7), but "git
help config" would always end up in git-config(1), I think).
