Python buffers its output by default.  On terminals it enables line
buffering, i.e. the accumulated output is flushed when a newline
character is reached.  Otherwise it uses a system-dependent buffer
size in the range of a few kilobytes.  You can check if your output
is a terminal e.g. with:

  python -c "import sys; print(sys.stdout.isatty())"

You can disable buffering by running your script with "python -u".
This discussion mentions more options:

  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/107705/disable-output-buffering

You can also start bash on the command line.  I do wonder why Git CMD
seems to be started in what passes as a terminal, while Git BASH is
not, though.

You may want to check out https://gitforwindows.org/ and report your
findings using their issue tracker.

(This mailing list here, git@vger.kernel.org, is mostly used for
discussing Git itself, not so much about extra tools like bash or
Python that are packaged with Git for Windows.)
