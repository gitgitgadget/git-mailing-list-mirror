The answer is probably: people who suspect something is broken. We could
perhaps also turn it on for CI to be more complete there (and where 30
seconds of CPU time is relatively much smaller). It was also handy to
have while timing the impact, of course.

I'm not opposed to having it be less flexible, and in fact I wrote it
that way originally. But it doesn't actually make the code much simpler.
The assignments to _DEFAULT in the scripts become GIT_TEST_CHAIN_LINT_HARDER
and the read side has one less level of defaulting:

-test "${GIT_TEST_CHAIN_LINT_HARDER:-${GIT_TEST_CHAIN_LINT_HARDER_DEFAULT:-1}}" != 0 &&
+test "${GIT_TEST_CHAIN_LINT_HARDER:-1}" != 0 &&

I guess it's conceptually a little simpler, though. I dunno. I sort of
assumed it would just work and nobody would need to ever look at or
configure it either way. :)

Yeah, I suspect that would work in general. But it seems like even more
complexity (now you have a cache of "I linted this script at time X and
it was good" that has to be written). It does increase the possible
savings though (up to perhaps 100 or so seconds of parallel CPU in my
case).

I think a bigger and better version of that is to actually see which
code paths are run by which scripts, and not even bother running scripts
that don't touch code which has changed. But that's a _lot_ more
complicated, and writing such a tool is probably at least worth a thesis
project. ;)
