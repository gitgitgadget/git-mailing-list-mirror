I struggled to find the mircoprojects page - I must have missed the link 
on the outreachy site. In case anyone else is struggling to find it here 
is the project

     Unify the meaning of -dirty between diff and describe

     git diff reports a submodule directory, whose tracked
     contents match the commit at the HEAD in the submodule, as
     -dirty when there is an untracked file in the submodule
     directory. This is inconsistent with what git describe
     --dirty says when run in the submodule directory in that
     state. [1]

As I understand it if a submodule contains any untracked files (i.e. a 
file that has not been added with `git add` and is not ignored by any 
.gitignore or .git/info/exclude entries) then running `git diff` in the 
superproject will report that the submodule is dirty - there will be a 
line something like "+Subproject commit abcdef-dirty". However if we run 
`git describe --dirty` in the submodule directory then it will not 
append "-dirty" to it's output unless there are changes to tracked files.

I'd start my trying to build git and running t4027-diff-submodule.sh.
If you look at the start of the test 'git diff HEAD with dirty submodule 
(untracked)' in t/t4027-diff-submodule.sh it sets up a submodule with an 
untracked file. If you add "test_pause &&" after the diff command in 
that test it will start a shell in the test directory and you can run 
`git diff HEAD` yourself  to see the output and also `git -C sub diff 
HEAD` which will run diff in the submodule directory. The latter command 
should show that there are no changes in the tracked files of the 
submodule. Just exit the shell to get the test to continue. (you can see 
in builtin/describe.c that when it is run with `--dirty` it runs `git 
diff-index HEAD` to determine if a repository is dirty). To change the 
output of diff I would look for the string "Subproject commit" in diff.c 
to find the code that adds '-dirty' and try working backwards from 
there. Let me know if you get stuck - it took we a while to work 
backwards to find where we check if the submodule is dirty.

Best Wishes

Phillip
