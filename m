I don't agree. I prefer to use localized/translated software [1], even
though I'm able to speak English, because it's just easier to use, but
I strongly consider translated technical terms nearly unusable - you
lose a common base for communication with other people and you can't
use most documentation any longer as it'll be in English or at least
use the original, non-translated technical terms. So I think the
target audience for a German translation is neither only nor primarily
people not understanding English [2] but all those who do speak
English but prefer a localized environment.

Don't let us get back to the times where a "computer" was a
"Rechenmaschine", the CPU a "Zentralrecheneinheit" or email
"elektronische Post" ...

[1] And German translations of books, movies etc. - mostly, that is.
[2] You won't get far in IT if you're not able to understand at least
some English, I think.
