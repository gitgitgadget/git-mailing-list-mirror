Let me know if I can help out at all.  If Google doesn't want to host
it, but everyone still wants to string together the GSOC summit and
this, I'm sure GitHub can find a nice venue for us and get some food
and whatnot.  Or, if we can simply 'sponsor' it or something - give
the Goog money to host it for us, however that might work.  We want to
help this happen again this year, so keep me in the loop and we can
make sure it gets handled somehow.
