I think it is the fact that msys-1.0.dll is a stripped-down fork of 
cygwin1.dll.

It is needed to run shell and perl scripts.

(Unfortunately, a few important parts of Git are still implemented as 
shell scripts: bisect, pull and rebase being the most obvious to me, but 
repack, stash and submodule are not too unimportant, either.)

If it is a PATH issue, then it should be fixable by teaching msysGit to 
prepend $GIT_ROOT/bin and $GIT_ROOT/libexec/git-core to the PATH, but 
AFAIR we already do that.

*clicketyclick*

Yep, from reading setup_path() in exec_cmd.c, it appears that we prepend 
the PATH correctly.

Traditionally, we did have problems with Cygwin, that is correct, but I 
think with your help we can resolve the interaction issues.

Ciao,
