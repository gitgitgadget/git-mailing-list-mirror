Yeah, I'm not sure how such a check would be done. On most Linux systems
I've seen, $LANG will mention "en_US.UTF-8" or similar. But I've no idea
how portable that convention is, not to mention that people may have
more complex setups anyway (e.g., not setting $LANG but setting some of
LC_*).

But more importantly, this is not even a UTF-8 problem. It is "can your
terminal do something sensible with high-bit characters in filenames of
your repositories". We don't know the encoding of those filenames (and
you may even have a mix).

(And likewise "terminal" here is really "whatever consumes Git's output,
be it the terminal or some program you've piped to).

Yes. If we're going to do anything, I think it would be to say "most
terminals and programs deal with high-bit characters OK these days, so
switching the default is more likely to fix things than break them".

I suspect most scripts would be OK either way. They need to handle
maybe-quoted filenames already, so it is really just a question of
whether the consuming program is OK with the high bits. If so, we could
probably get away with just a mention in the release notes, rather than
an annoying transition phase (which is likely to simply confuse most
users, who are unaware of the issue entirely).

But I'd feel more confident if whoever proposes such a change does some
research on how piping such names into common tools and scripting
languages works (both for utf8 and non-utf8 names).
