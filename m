It's OK to send re-rolls of patches that are in "seen". That branch is
rewound and rewritten regularly as part of Junio's integration cycles.
Once a commit is in "next", then it is generally considered set in
stone, and fixes should come on top rather than as re-rolls.

(There is one exception; "next" is rewound after a release, so that is
an opportunity for topics that were so muddled in their earlier
incarnation to get rewritten. That is pretty rare, though).
