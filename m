Hello there,

i tried to setup gitosis on a Fedora 11 system,
since i dont seem to be the only person having trouble here,
i am asking here now.

someone pasted that:
http://paste.org/pastebin/view/9154
and that's just the way i did it and the way i end in :-(

with the only difference i was using another 'tutorial'
http://www.shakthimaan.com/installs/gitosis.html

i tried a bit an sometimes ended in the prompt to enter password for
gitosis@server after "git push..." No idea what to do.

I asked #git and #fedora on freenode, was referred to this list.
So can anyone gimme a hint?

_____
luck up
brizly
