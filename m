For better or worse reusing the same strbuf is a common pattern and when 
I saw the code switch to using a different variable I wondered if it was 
because the value of buf was being used later. It is also confusing to 
free msg in a different place to all the other variables. rebase_cmd() 
being so long does not help (msg is defined 763 lines before its first 
use) as it makes it harder to see what is going on.

It is confusing to the reader though, I spent time checking why the 
strbuf_release() call was there before concluding it was a mistake.

In a short function where it is easy to see what happens between the 
variable declaration and its use I'd agree but here everything is so 
spread out I actually found the switch to a second variable confusing.
