I can reproduce here on my Debian unstable system.

Looks like the system npm completion is the culprit:

  $ grep COMP_WORDBREAKS /etc/bash_completion.d/*
  /etc/bash_completion.d/npm:COMP_WORDBREAKS=${COMP_WORDBREAKS/=/}
  /etc/bash_completion.d/npm:COMP_WORDBREAKS=${COMP_WORDBREAKS/@/}
  /etc/bash_completion.d/npm:export COMP_WORDBREAKS

  $ dpkg -S /etc/bash_completion.d/npm
  npm: /etc/bash_completion.d/npm

Looks like there's already a bug filed:

  https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=711810

Sadly there's even a patch which was taken upstream, but the debian
packaged version of npm is just woefully out of date.
