Subject: [PATCH 05/11] completion: improve handling quoted paths on the command line

Our git-aware path completion doesn't work when it has to complete a
word already containing quoted and/or backslash-escaped characters on
the command line.  The root cause of the issue is that completion
functions see all words on the command line verbatim, i.e. including
all backslash, single and double quote characters that the shell would
eventually remove when executing the finished command.  These
quoting/escaping characters cause different issues depending on which
path component of the word to be completed contains them:

  - The quoting/escaping is in the prefix path component(s).

    Let's suppose we have a directory called 'New Dir', containing two
    untracked files 'file.c' and 'file.o', and we have a gitignore
    rule ignoring object files.  In this case all of these:

      git add New\ Dir/<TAB>
      git add "New Dir/<TAB>
      git add 'New Dir/<TAB>

    should uniquely complete 'file.c' right away, but Bash offers both
    'file.c' and 'file.o' instead.  The reason for this behavior is
    that our completion script uses the prefix directory name like
    'git -C "New\ Dir/" ls-files ...", i.e. with the backslash inside
    double quotes.  Git then tries to enter a directory called
    'New\ Dir', which (most likely) fails because such a directory
    doesn't exists.  As a result our completion script doesn't list
    any files, leaves the COMPREPLY array empty, which in turn causes
    Bash to fall back to its simple filename completion and lists all
    files in that directory, i.e. both 'file.c' and 'file.o'.

  - The quoting/escaping is in the path component to be completed.

    Let's suppose we have two untracked files 'New File.c' and
    'New File.o', and we have a gitignore rule ignoring object files.
    In this case all of these:

      git add New\ Fi<TAB>
      git add "New Fi<TAB>
      git add 'New Fi<TAB>

    should uniquely complete 'New File.c' right away, but Bash offers
    both 'New File.c' and 'New File.o' instead.  The reason for this
    behavior is that our completion script uses this 'New\ Fi' or
    '"New Fi' etc. word to filter matching paths, and of course none
    of the potential filenames will match because of the included
    backslash or double quote.  The end result is the same as above:
    the completion script doesn't list any files, Bash falls back to
    its filename completion, which then lists the matching object file
    as well.

Add the new helper function __git_dequote() [1], which removes (most
of[2]) the quoting and escaping from the word it gets as argument.  To
minimize the overhead of calling this function, store its result in
the variable $dequoted_word, supposed to be declared local in the
caller; simply printing the result would require a command
substitution imposing the overhead of fork()ing a subshell.  Use this
function in __git_complete_index_file() to dequote the current word,
i.e. the path, to be completed, to avoid the above described
quoting-related issues, thereby fixing two of the failing quoted path
completion tests.

[1] The bash-completion project already has a dequote() function,
    which I hoped I could borrow to deal with this, but unfortunately
    it doesn't work quite well for this purpose (perhaps that's why
    even the bash-completion project only rarely uses it).  The main
    issue is that their dequote() is implemented as:

      eval printf %s "$1" 2> /dev/null

    where $1 would contain the word to be completed.  While it's a
    short and sweet one-liner, the use of 'eval' requires that $1 is a
    syntactically valid string, which is not the case when quoting the
    path like 'git add "New Dir/<TAB>'.  This causes 'eval' to fail,
    because it can't find the matching closing double quote, and the
    function returns nothing.  The result is totally broken behavior,
    as if the current word were empty, and the completion script would
    then list all files from the current directory.  This is why one
    of the quoted path completion tests specifically checks the
    completion of a path with an opening but without a corresponding
    closing double quote character.  Furthermore, the 'eval' performs
    all kinds of expansions, which may or may not be desired; I think
    it's the latter.  Finally, using this function would require a
    command substitution.

[2] Bash understands the $'string' quoting as well, which "expands to
    'string', with backslash-escaped characters replaced as specified
    by the ANSI C standard" (quoted from Bash manpage).  Since shell
    metacharacters, field separators, globbing, etc. can all be easily
    entered using standard shell escaping or quoting, this type of
    quoting comes in handly when dealing with control characters that
    are otherwise difficult both to "type" and to see on the command
    line.  Because of this difficulty I would assume that people do
    avoid pathnames with such control characters anyway, so I didn't
    bother implementing it.  This function is already way too long as
    it is.

Notes:
    What if someone on Windows were to use backslash as directory
    separator during path completion?  E.g. 'git add new-dir\subdir\<TAB>'
    Did that happen to work in the past?  Does this patch break it?
