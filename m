I think this is a good change for fixing the immediate problem of the
test suite failing.

But I have to wonder if this is masking a problem that real users will
see. Aren't we silently discarding trace2 output that could be useful to
somebody debugging or trying to get performance metrics?

I.e., should we be bumping the internal nesting max of 2 to something
higher? If that would that cause problems with existing metrics, should
we be designing new metrics to avoid nesting?
