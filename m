Maybe you are misunderstanding something in a major way,...

... and that is exactly what this "unmerge to re-populate higher
order stages" does.  The multi-parent diff you have been looking
at failed merge _is_ generated by comparing the higher order
stages and your working tree file.

You cannot it have both ways.  Either you want to have the unmerged
entries (so that you *can* view the combined diff), or you do
not want to have them (then you obviously cannot view the
combined diff between the working tree file and these stages).
