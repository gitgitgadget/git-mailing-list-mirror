I could see doing it before.  I'd like to leave it as is for now.
Let's fix the correctness now and we can fine tune it later (with
your suggestion below).

That makes me wonder if it would it be better to have the script
keep all of the test time values?  That is, create something like
test_time.$test_count.$test_seq.  Then you could look at all of
the timings over the whole test script, rather just of those of the
one where you stopped it.
