Hi,

I've cloned a very large repository on OS X and want to move that to Windows
(trying to avoid to clone the repository a second time). What steps should I
do to make it working (currently, I'm getting an error on pull/merge that
"Entry 'foo' is not uptodate. Cannot merge.")?

Thanks in advance,
Tom
