Hi Pavan,

This is great stuff. As you know, the ideas page is really only about 
giving the students ideas what type of projects we'd like to see. But it 
is always better to have a project with your heart and soul behind it.

Provided that we get accepted, you will have time to put up an application 
for this project between March 29 and April 9, according to the timeline:

http://socghop.appspot.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2010/faqs#timeline

But I think you wanted to hear some feedback to your idea. So here goes my 
feedback:

- It is a very interesting idea. I already know a few users who would be 
  happy to use it.

- It is good that you mention the preferred programming language... While 
  I got used to Python, I am by far not good enough to mentor :-)

- There is little chance that this project will become a core part of Git, 
  as it is too far outside of the original focus of it, namely allowing 
  developers to version-control their source code they have in a local 
  directory.

That latter point does not say that your project is not worth it, though! 
As I said, I think it would be very useful to have.

Ciao,
Dscho
