Hello, list!

I have a trouble with postings to this mailing list.
I can post from mutt or git-send-email,
but not from claws-mail email-client (and only claws-mail, sic!)
Messages are gone ok, CC account got that messages but not git list.

I wrote a message with a question about this to Lars Ingebrigtsen
<larsi@gnus.org> but he redirected me to "the admin for the git mailing
list"

Could anyone tell me who is the admin of this list?

Sorry for the offtopic, but I did not found another way to get an
answer.

Thanks in advance.

P.S. Advices to change email-client are not accepted ;;;)
