Thanks, this is definitely a bug worth addressing. But note...

We generally don't consider .git/index (or pack .bitmap files, which
also use this implementation) to be a major part of Git's attack
surface, since they are generated locally. And if you can write to
somebody's .git directory, there are already much easier ways to execute
arbitrary code.

Yep. We also fail to check if we even have enough bytes to read the
buffer_size in the first place.

Here are some patches. The first one fixes the problem you found. The
second one drops some dead code that has a related problem. And the
third just drops some dead code that I noticed in the same file. :)

  [1/3]: ewah_read_mmap: bounds-check mmap reads
  [2/3]: ewah: drop ewah_deserialize function
  [3/3]: ewah: drop ewah_serialize_native function
