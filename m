I couldn't reproduce either with my usual build, but I don't usually use
autoconf. Running:

  make configure
  ./configure
  make
  (cd t && ./t1308-*)

does fail for me. The problem is that the generated config.mak.autogen
sets the wrong value for FREAD_READS_DIRECTORIES (and overrides the
default entry for Linux from config.mak.uname. So the configure script
needs to be fixed.
