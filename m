Yeah, that is intentional. The rationale is that if you're specifying "I
won't compute any more than N filters" but don't say "compute and write
changed-path Bloom filters", then you'll compute 0 < N filters, which is
fine.

I considered making this a warning, but ultimately decided against it.
In particular, I had users who might set 'commitGraph.maxNewFilters' to
some value, but only sometimes write a commit-graph with
'--changed-paths'.

Good idea, I'll drop that.

That's a wonderful question, and yes: that's how it's supposed to work.
Implicit in all of this is that these commit-graph options are only
acting over the new layers that we are going to write. So, if we're
going to roll-up older layers, we'll start with their uncomputed
filters before computing new filters in later layers.

This is the same thing as running 'git commit-graph write --reachable
--changed-paths --split' (omitting '--max-new-filters' is not a typo
there). Because the commit-graph command only acts over new layers, old
layers do not suddenly get Bloom filters computed and those filters
rewritten. If a user wants that to happen, they can pass
'--split=replace', which will force all existing graphs to reside in a
new, single layer chain.

Let's use the following version of the patch which I think will clarify
your questions:

--- >8 ---

Subject: [PATCH] builtin/commit-graph.c: introduce '--max-new-filters=<n>'

Introduce a command-line flag to specify the maximum number of new Bloom
filters that a 'git commit-graph write' is willing to compute from
scratch.

Prior to this patch, a commit-graph write with '--changed-paths' would
compute Bloom filters for all selected commits which haven't already
been computed (i.e., by a previous commit-graph write with '--split'
such that a roll-up or replacement is performed).

This behavior can cause prohibitively-long commit-graph writes for a
variety of reasons:

  * There may be lots of filters whose diffs take a long time to
    generate (for example, they have close to the maximum number of
    changes, diffing itself takes a long time, etc).

  * Old-style commit-graphs (which encode filters with too many entries
    as not having been computed at all) cause us to waste time
    recomputing filters that appear to have not been computed only to
    discover that they are too-large.

This can make the upper-bound of the time it takes for 'git commit-graph
write --changed-paths' to be rather unpredictable.

To make this command behave more predictably, introduce
'--max-new-filters=<n>' to allow computing at most '<n>' Bloom filters
from scratch. This lets "computing" already-known filters proceed
quickly, while bounding the number of slow tasks that Git is willing to
do.
