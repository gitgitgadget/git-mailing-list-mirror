The problem needs to be addressed, Jonathan.  Which is precisely why I
wrote this patch: to calmly and rationally discuss the issue, and
dampen the chances of repetition.  You do not do it by losing your
patience, becoming emotional, and fueling a large ongoing fire.
Prolonging fires do not help prevent them from recurring, as evidenced
by previous fires; this is because there is no takeaway from a fire.
All that's left are a few shreds and ashes.  From this very fire, we
gained NOTHING, and lost Duy.

It is absolutely imperative to keep all our contributors productive,
and maximize output.  If there is something troubling you, this is the
right thread to speak on.
