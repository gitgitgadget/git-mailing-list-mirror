Thanks for resuming this work. The patches both look good to me.

I think your hack is better than introducing yet another dependency.
And because it's isolated and you've documented it well, it will be easy
to undo later if we choose.

The doc-diff tool should tell us if we catch any false positives inside
the text (though it seems quite unlikely to me).

Yes, sadly I still can't format the docs at all with 2.0.10 (which is
what ships in Debian unstable).

Yeah, I do still like that as an endgame, but I like what you have here
as an intermediate step in the right direction.

Yay. :)
