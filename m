Yeah, I feared there might be fallouts like this. We are somewhat
blindly passing down the "--quiet" flag without doing a careful audit of
the severity levels in merge-recursive. Potentially we would want a few
levels of verbosity:

  -2: totally silent (-q -q)
  -1: silence chat, mention important errors like CONFLICT markers (-q)
   0: current defaults
   1: more verbosity (-v, what is currently level "3", I guess?)
  >1: and so on with more "-v"; I don't even know what levels are used

That's off the top of my head. I think it really needs somebody to look
through and categorize all of the messages generated by merge-recursive.
In the meantime, unless somebody is planning to jump on this topic
immediately (I am not), I think we can revert 2bf15a3330a from master.
It's definitely fixing _a_ problem, but it's one we've lived with for
many years already.
