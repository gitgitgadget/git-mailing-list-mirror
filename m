Of course we use git; that's not the question.

I understood your posting such that you have sent a "GIT user survey"
to the U-Boot mailing list:  you  wrote:  "is  [typo  for  `it'  ?  -
referring to Subject:, i. e. `GIT user survey'?] has been sent to the
following projects..."

I wanted to make clear that nothing  has  been  sent  to  the  U-Boot
project. At least I haven't seen anything, nor can I find anything in
the archives.

Best regards,

Wolfgang Denk
