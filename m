Ah, this is the magic. Doing:

  set +x 2>/dev/null

will still show it, but doing the redirection in a wrapping block means
that it is applied before the command inside the block is run. Clever.

I think this braces trick could be used in general to fix all of the
remaining "you can't run this under -x" cases, though it might be ugly.
It might also be possible to make test_eval_ a bit less subtle with it,
though I think it is relying on the braces already (which makes me
wonder if I just totally forgot about its existence today, or if I
earlier somehow stumbled onto a working recipe because I wanted to run
multiple redirected commands).

Yeah, this is inherently a global flag that we're playing games with. It
does seem like it would be easy to get it wrong. I guess the right model
is considering it like a stack, like:

-- >8 --
#!/bin/sh

x_counter=0
pop_x() {
	ret=$?
	case "$x_counter" in
	0)
		echo >&2 "BUG: too many pops"
		exit 1
		;;
	1)
		x_counter=0
		set -x
		;;
	*)
		x_counter=$((x_counter - 1))
		;;
	esac
	{ return $ret; } 2>/dev/null
}

# you _must_ call this as "{ push_x; } 2>/dev/null" to avoid polluting
# trace output with the push call
push_x() {
	set +x 2>/dev/null
	x_counter=$((x_counter + 1))
}

bar() {
	{ push_x; } 2>/dev/null
	echo in bar
	pop_x
}

foo() {
	{ push_x; } 2>/dev/null
	echo in foo, before bar
	bar
	echo in foo, after bar
	false
	pop_x
}

set -x
foo
echo \$? is $?
-- 8< --

I wish there was a way to avoid having to do the block-and-redirect in
the push_x calls in each function, though.

I dunno. I do like the output, but this is rapidly getting complex.

Yeah, there is no "goto out" to help give a common exit point from the
function. You could probably do it with a wrapper, like:

  foo() {
	{ push_x; } 2>/dev/null
	real_foo "$@"
	pop_x
  }

and then real_foo() is free to return however it likes. I wonder if you
could even wrap that up in a helper:

  disable_function_tracing () {
	# rename foo() to orig_foo(); this works in bash, but I'm not
	# sure if there's a portable way to do it (and ideally one that
	# wouldn't involve an extra process).
	eval "real_$1 () $(declare -f $1 | tail -n +2)"

	# and then install a wrapper which pushes/pops tracing
	eval "$1 () { { push_x; } 2>/dev/null; real_$1 \"\$@\"; pop_x; }"
  }

  foo () { .... }
  disable_function_tracing foo

It would be easier if you could just declare the function body as an
argument (and then it would be "declare_untraceable_function", where you
do it all in one step). But then the function body has to be in single
quotes, which is a pain. I think this is definitely pushing the limits
of portable shell (and quite possibly the limits of good taste).
