  Hi,

  I have just set up a (fairly crude, but hey, it seems to work) wiki at

	http://git.or.cz/gitwiki

  It's slow and ugly but if it becomes popular, I will move it to
something better than Apache CGI. ;-) I also haven't written more than
an introductory paragraph on the front page, the rest is up to you.

  I'm personally not exceptionally fond of wikis (other than Wikipedia)
but a wish to have one has been expressed several times and I hope it
will be helpful for the Git community; not only the newbies might dig
(and especially exchange!) some useful information, tips'n'trick and
such.  Ideally, it could become a melting pot for the Documentation/
directories or the rather austere (I take patches) Git homepage - or
something entirely different. Whatever _you_ make from it.

  Editally yours,

Right now I am having amnesia and deja-vu at the same time.  I think
I have forgotten this before.
