Yikes.  Anyway, if we have it in Moutain View after the GSoC mentor
summit I can probably offer up a couch and some floor space to a
couple of folks.  Hopefully by then I will have the huge stacks
of boxes put somewhere and there will actually be some space for
people in my flat.  As it stands there is very little space for
myself and my wife.

That's what I'm starting to think.  We either hold it after the GSoC
mentor summit in Mountain View, or we defer until some time in 2009,
where we actually have time to put something together.

This is an interesting idea.  I like it.
