Pasky, the homepage seems a bit pointless. Each individual page is so 
small that splitting it up into six different pages is just 
counter-productive.

I'd almost suggest making it _one_ page, perhaps with some shortcuts 
within it (ie a "http://git.or.cz/index.html#tools" shortcut within the 
page instead of having a separate "http://git.or.cz/tools.html" page)

Hmm?

In contrast, the wiki frontpage actually works pretty well - it's got more 
of that kind of "multiple sub-headers all on the same page" kind of 
layout, with just extra _details_ behind the links.

I don't know about everybody else, but I get irritated at webpages that 
force me to just switch to another page to get any information. It's like 
how some web journalists split up a story over 20 pages, and each page is 
just a few paragraphs and some graphic (and the commercials, of course).

I'd much rather _scroll_ a bit, or use ^F to _search_, than have to click 
through links.
