 Reading mailing list threads it is becoming common these days to hear
 about contributors with patches ready to be sent as soon as 1.5.4 is
 out.

 Would be a good idea to open a new branch new_stuff as a target for
 this pending stuff?

Back when Mr. Torvalds was still leading the development there was not this stupid stability freeze and many useful patches were accepted every day.  For the past few months Mr. Hammano has not been adding much useful code himself, did not join interesting discussions such as Unicode normalization issues, nor gave much useful comments on patches. He has mostly been busy rejecting useful patches and sending not so useful comments.

Can we vote Mr. Hammano out and ask Mr. Torvalds to come back as the project leader?  I do not mean any disrespect to Mr. Hammano, but don't people think he outlived his usefulness as the project leader?
