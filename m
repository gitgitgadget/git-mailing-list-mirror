My feeling is that we shouldn't care too much about platforms without
variadic macros. AFAIK they are an extreme minority at this point, if
they exist at all. We are being nice by making Git compile at all on
such platforms, but I don't want people doing normal development work
(like writing trace or bug calls) to have to be thinking too much about
it.

I actually wonder if it is time to drop HAVE_VARIADIC_MACROS completely.
They are in C99, and we have been introducing many other C99-isms. It
would be a minor cleanup to a few bits of code, which perhaps isn't
worth the risk. But I also have a vague memory of not being able to
implement some interfaces because we couldn't count on them.

Poking around, 3689539127 (add helpers for allocating flex-array
structs, 2016-02-22) points out one such case. I think discussion of
BUG_ON() got blocked by that, too. Looks like we also discussed them in
the big "C99 weather balloon" thread:

  https://lore.kernel.org/git/20170710070342.txmlwwq6gvjkwtw7@sigill.intra.peff.net/

Maybe it's time for something like this as a test:
