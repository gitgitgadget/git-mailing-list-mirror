The patches there would actually work out of the box, because they
replace the config storage with the janky plaintext git-credential-store
mechanism. But it was that final compatibility step that I think made me
question whether it was really accomplishing much at all.

I do agree there should be an option to override, though (you can always
run "git config remote.origin.url" yourself, but I think it should be as
simple as a config or command line option to get the old behavior).
