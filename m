Please fix the manual for git log.  It should say what encoding is recognised 
(namely if supported by iconv(1), except that POSIX character maps of 
iconv(1p) are not supported), and that an unrecognised encoding is ignored.

I would also like to see the HTML encoding supported independently of iconv, 
which seems like a pretty easy thing to do.  Dream on, I guess?
