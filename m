Hi folks,

I am starting a project that I hope some of you will be interested in.
 I have been looking at DSCM tools for a few months now and I have
come away liking different aspects of different systems.  The project,
called Pyrite, aims to combine the best features of git and Mercurial.

Please stop by http://pyrite.sophiasuchtig.com/ to see the
announcement.  Links to the public repo in there.

Currently the project is in its infancy.  All that exists is a help
system, but the help is sort of a roadmap for what I want to bring to
users.

Please give me any feedback that you think may help the project or
make it more desirable for people to use.  You can respond to this
email or leave comments on the above post.

Thank You,
Govind.
