I think "Result" would be better than "Selection" here.

Also, shouldn't all the ^ in these examples be {caret}?  (I likely just 
don't understand the rationale for using {caret} in some places and ^ in 
others...)

I have a mixed reaction to showing this "C^1" expansion, and the "B^1 
B^2 B^3" one as well.  I see the appeal of showing the parent notation, 
but really that was already explained to death in the first section. 
Here it's distracting.  I think it's clearer for the reader to remove 
these expansions and just use the node names from the illustration.

I think this expansion might be better expressed as "C ^C^@".  It'll be 
the same for "B^! = B ^B^@" as well, which demonstrates a nice 
consistency and also helps to emphasize the meaning of the ^@ notation.

The layout of these last two lines doesn't match the others.  They 
should be:

    B^!    = B ^B^1 ^B^2   ^B^3
           = B ^D ^E ^F    B

I see that the next patch fixes the layout of the unchanged examples, 
but it leaves these two unaligned.
