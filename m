I checked the caller here, and indeed, it's passing an array-of-struct
so your patch is doing the right thing (not that I doubted it, but
that's what review is for).

This qsort void-pointer convention seems to create a lot of confusion
(not just the lack of type-safety, but the fact that it's getting a
pointer to the element). I felt like we had a discussion about this a
while ago, and indeed, I found:

The whole sub-thread is worth reading, but the macro you arrived at in:

  https://lore.kernel.org/git/c141fb44-904f-e8b6-119f-7d2d6bcfd81a@web.de/

seems pretty reasonable.
