FWIW I am not interested on implementing a comment feature (regardless of
what the subject says, and indeed was going to use quotes around it in my
original patch), but it was already too long ;)

my objective was to allow people that were not upgrading because of this
"regression" a path forward, but after all this discussion I am convinced
too that my approach is misguided.

if users are already manually editing this file, they should be able to
fix the corrupted lines themselves but the error shown needs to be improved.
and the failure mode corrected as well so they are not blocked.

this also means that my "sneaky" way to fix formatting issues is gone
and the passthrough is called so nothing will be lost, but as you also
said the location is not warranted to be kept so this comment "feature"
is as useless as intended.

would something like the following (wouldn't pass the last test yet as
it will need special handling to be able to handle the full path of the
broken file as shown in the warning sent to stderr) on top of Junio's
make more sense?

it still "silently" fixes the formatting issues where a leading tab (test
added) or spaces were added to easy the transition, but probably should
also error out as Junio suggested originally.

had also updated the commit message and what is left of the documentation.

Subject: [RFC PATCH v4] git-credential-store: skip empty lines and comments
 from store

with the added checks for invalid URLs in credentials, any locally
modified store files which might have empty lines or even comments
were reported[1] failing to parse as valid credentials.

using the store file in this manner wasn't intended by the original
code and it had latent issues which the new code dutifully prevented
but since the strings used wouldn't had been valid credentials anyway
we could instead detect them and skip the matching logic and therefore
prevent a fatal failure.

trim all lines as they are being read from the store file and skip the
ones that will be otherwise empty or that start with "#" (therefore
assuming them to be comments) but warn users so they will be make
aware of the issues introduced by their manual editing.
