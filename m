Some things I noted in the blog:

The explanation is pretty close. The wording could be tweaked a little
to be more precise. Particularly "assume" isn't a proper word to
explain the working of summary. It works based on facts not
assumptions. Something along the lines of:

    As far as I have learned, summary prints a git log --oneline
    between the revision checked out in the submodule and the revision
    "known" to the superproject (i.e., the revision found in the index
    of the superproject).

>  If no revision is specified of the submodule then we assume it to be HEAD

As discussed elsewhere, the revision passed to the summary command is
the revision of the superproject and not the revision of the submodule.

> $ git submodule summary my-subm
>   * my-subm abc123..def456
>     < some commit

>     < some another commit 

While the command above would produce the result you mention when
'my-subm' in the repo. The command itself is incorrect if it's
intention is to print "only" the summary of 'my-subm'. This is the
format of the 'summary' sub-command according to the doc:

    summary [--cached|--files] [(-n|--summary-limit) <n>] [commit] [--]
[<path>...]

So, it expects a 'commit' followed by the 'path'. As you had passed the
path as the first argument it would be treated as the 'commit' argument.
As 'my-subm' is likely not a valid commit-ish, the script would
default to 'HEAD' (the final else mentioned below) and would
print the summary of all the submodules. IOW, it just prints the
same output as:

   $ git submodule summary

in this case.

Again, it's the tree of the superproject that we're concerned about.

Fine. As we're using '/dev/null' as an input here. It would've been nice
if you had also mentioned that it serves as a "convenient empty file for
input streams"[1] because "reads from /dev/null always return end of
file"[2].

Not precise. That command would return the hash of an empty tree.

Characterising 'git rev-parse --verify ...' as not being able to print
the hash of a commit even when there is one in the repo seems incorrect
to me. There are other more likely cases which would lead to rev-parse
failing and that last else part getting executed. For instance, an
incorrect ref being passed as the first argument to the summary
sub-command like:

    git submodule summary no-such-ref-exists

or

    git submodule summary "invalid ref"

So, I think it would've been precise to just say:

    This means that if the above 2 cases fail then we make
    head as HEAD.
