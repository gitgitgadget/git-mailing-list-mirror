This is inconsistent with the implementation: according to the code in
one of the previous patches these entries are simple byte offsets, not
8-byte word offsets, i.e. the combined size of all modified path
Bloom filters can be at most 2^32 bytes.

The commit-graph file can contain information about at most 2^31-1
commits.  This means that with that many commits each commit can have
a merely 2 byte Bloom filter on average.  When using 7 hashes we'd
need 10 bits per path, so in two bytes we could store only a single
path.

Clearly, using 4 byte index entries significantly lowers the max
number of commits that can be stored with modified path Bloom filters.
IMO every new chunk must support at least 2^31-1 commits.

How should double hashing compute the k hashes, i.e. using 64 bit or
32 bit unsigned integer arithmetic?

I'm puzzled that you link to this paper and still use double hashing.

Two of the contributions of that paper are that it points out some
shortcomings of the double hashing scheme and provides a better
alternative in the form of enhanced double hashing, which can cut the
false positive rate in half.

However, that paper considers the hashing scheme only in the context
of one big Bloom filter.  I've found that when it comes to many small
Bloom filters then the k hashes produced by any double hashing variant
are not independent enough, and "standard" double hashing fares the
worst among them.  There are real repositories out there where double
hashing has over an order of magnitude higher average false positive
rate than enhanced double hashing.  Though that's not to say that
enhanced double hashing is good...

For details on these issues see

Since the ideal number of bits per element depends only on the number
of hashes per path (k / ln(2) â‰ˆ k * 10 / 7), why is this value stored
in the commit-graph?

What does this "Note:" prefix mean in the file format specification?

Can an implementation use a one byte Bloom filter with no bits set for
a commit with no changes?  Can an implementation still store a Bloom
filter for commits that modify more than 512 paths?

Given a sufficiently large number of commits with large enough Bloom
