I have recently used a program called Long Path Tool & i am so happy with the
results that this particular program does. I have more than 50 GB of
duplicate files in my computer and i was going crazy with the hard disk
space that was being consumed and thanks to the "Long Path Tool" where i
don't need to search each & every file to delete. Long Path Tool did the job
for me within a very short period of time. So no need to google each problem
to remove duplicate & unwanted files, just grab the program called Long Path
Tool.
