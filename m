Mainly that I'm an idiot and forgot we were actually creating a commit 
and can store the message and authorship there! More seriously I think 
being able to inspect the commit being cherry-picked (including the 
original commit message) is useful so we'd need to recreate something 
like CHERRY_PICK_HEAD when the conflict commit is checked out. 
Recreating CHERRY_PICK_HEAD is useful for "git status" as well. I think 
that means storing a little more that just the "tree A + tree B - tree 
C" thing.

That's a potentially attractive option which is fairly simple to 
implement locally as I think you can use the commit DAG to find all the 
descendants though that could be expensive if there are lots of 
branches. However, if we're going to share conflicts I think we'd need 
something like "hg evolve" - if I push a commit with conflicts and you 
base some work on it and then I resolve the conflict and push again you 
would want to your work to be rebased onto my conflict resolution. To 
handle "rebase --exec" we could store the exec command and run it when 
the  conflicts are resolved.

Also I wonder how annoying it would be in cases where I just want to 
rebase and resolve the conflicts now. At the moment "git rebase" stops 
at the conflict, with this feature I'd have to go and checkout the 
conflicted commit and fix the conflicts after the rebase had finished.

> difficult,

Yes, when I wrote my original message I was imagining that we'd stop at 
the first conflicting pick and store all the rebase state like some kind 
of stash on steroids so it could be continued when the conflict was 
resolved. It would be much simpler to try and avoid that.

Yes, though we may want to remember which commits were squashed together 
so the user can inspect that when resolving conflicts.

The commit message may have been edited so we lose the original message 
but I'm not sure how important that is.

I can't think of an immediate use for them. When we re-create conflicts 
we do it per-file based on the index entries created by the original 
merge so I don't think we need to know anything about the strategy or 
strategy-options.

> Am I missing anything?

exec commands? If the user runs "git rebase --exec" and there are 
conflicts then we'd need to defer running the exec commands until the 
conflicts are resolved. For something like "git rebase --exec 'make 
test'" that should be fine. I wonder if there are corner cases where the 
exec command changes HEAD though.

Yes, as we're creating some kind of commit we don't need to preserve 
those files separately.

Yes, it would certainly be lots of work.
