True. The best time to present these ideas would be while the series
was under review, which was a reasonable amount of time. But there's
no helping that, so what can we learn from your extensive work here?

My initial reaction is "it's too late for a format change now" but
that's not quite true. Even if we ship v2.27.0 with the existing
format, the data is in optional chunks. It would not be too difficult
to replace the storage with a different set of optional chunks and
stop reading the old ones. The question remains: exactly _how much
better_ is your implementation, and is it enough to justify the
upheaval?

The other thing that impacts this consideration is how complicated
the format becomes. Bloom filters are already complicated, so how
can we keep things simple when possible?

These are all very interesting items. Here is my initial categorization:

These are bold claims that I hope you have end-to-end performance
numbers to back them up. Depending on how much the benefit is, then
we can consider a replacing.

These bullets seem like they may apply to the existing implementation,
since they seem unrelated to the format itself. Is it possible to
contribute these ideas to the existing implementation first?

These items are confusing to me. I either don't know what they mean,
or doubt the value of having them present.

(This last item in particular is one where I have already communicated
why there is little value in storing filters for diffs against a
second parent. Perhaps you have some concrete numbers on what happens
in terms of storage-vs-performance when adding these diffs.)

And now you get to the _real_ hard part of this feature. It is easy to
create a prototype that implements the idea, but it's another step to
make it a full contribution. You clearly know this, which I expect is
the reason this was not submitted earlier.

These 14 patches are probably worth submitting on their own. I hope they
still apply cleanly to a recent master.

Ok, these implement the new filter format.

This is really interesting! This could apply to the existing format, so
when you compare formats this patch should either be in both or in neither.

Ok, here are some extra patches that implement your extra features. The
multi-parent filters are a fair thing to compare against the existing
implementation, but we need to compare file size changes, extra computation
time changes, and how much the end-to-end rev-list performance changes.
Are the costs justified?

>   33/34 commit-graph: write modified path Bloom filters in "history order"

I think we've covered this in these two patches:

3d112755056 commit-graph: examine commits by generation number
d21ee7d1110 commit-graph: examine changed-path objects in pack order

>   34/34 commit-graph: use modified path Bloom filters with wildcards, if possible
> 
> Finally a cherry on top.

This is also something that could be interesting for the current
implementation. Perhaps group it with patches 1-14 and 24, if the idea
applies to the existing implementation.

I think it would be great to apply whatever code cleanups and fixes
that you've presented here to the existing implementation _first_,
then we have the optimal way to compare how your proposed format
improves over the existing implementation.
 
I can't commit more time to this series today, but hopefully the discussion
is just getting started. I'll try to poke around some of the patches
next week.

Thanks,
