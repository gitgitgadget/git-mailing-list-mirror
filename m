Hi there,
Hasanybody ever written a script that keeps track of your favorite Git(and SVN) projects? E.g. sends you an e-mail every time a revision hasbeen made, with details like the summary, time and date, author andcode differences.

I've modified a few projects to my liking, somuch that any change made to the original would have to be addedmanually. I also think it would be a great way to learn.

I can'timagine anything better than a neat little Ruby script stacked insidemy crontab. I'm still a rookie though, otherwise I'd have made my ownalready.

Kyrre
