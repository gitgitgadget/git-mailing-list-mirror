Correct.  MSVC also supports designated initializers but does not fully 
support C99.

We do use MSVC internally as that gives us access to the great debuggers 
and profilers on the Windows platform.  Fortunately, this particular C99 
construct _is_ supported by MSVC.  I applied the patch below and 
complied it with both MSVC and gcc for Windows and both builds succeeded.
