  Hi,

  I've just finally killed the HTTP auth for project administration that
was destroying everyone's lives, and added support for resetting
forgotten passwords, two main things that seemed to be the popular nits
of the repo.or.cz audience.

  So now I wonder, what is the thing you miss most there? Any cool stuff
repo.or.cz could (preferrably easily) do and doesn't?

  And please don't ask for smaller roundtrip times of requests for
administrator assistance. ;-)

  Thanks,
