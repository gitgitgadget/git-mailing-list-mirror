This will (as you point out) only lead to problems, because rewriting
the history at commit-time will have the effect that a push leaves you
in the situation where you end up with a different history on the
workstation and the server. All branches off the pushed branch will
become a hell, and a clusterfck of darkness and terror will take over.

Denying a push is much more elegant than rewriting, but (as I pointed
out in my other mail) also has a lot of problems with distributed
work-flows. And let's face it when changing from SVN to Git, the
distributed nature is about the last feature that you'd want to give
up ;)

Very well said, I completely agree!
