I can second that. If I have the choice between a German (no matter whether
good or bad translated) and an English version of a software, I'll choose
the English one.

Also, the support aspect might be important. If a German would use a
software version which reports a German error, non-German speakers will most
likely not be able to help him/her and even worse, (s)he will most likely
not be able to find a solution by searching google for this error message.
