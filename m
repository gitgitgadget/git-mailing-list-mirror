Sure, but would anybody actually want to _use_ the non-wrapped version?
That's the same duality we have now with string_list.

I dunno, I think could provide some safety and some clarity. IOW, why
_don't_ we like:

  string_list_append_nodup(list, xstrfmt(fmt, ...));

? I think because:

  1. It's a bit long and ugly.

  2. It requires a magic "nodup", because we're violating the memory
     ownership boundary.

  3. It doesn't provide any safety for the case where strdup_strings is
     not set, making it easy to leak accidentally.

Doing:

  string_list_appendf(list, fmt, ...);

pushes the memory ownership semantics "under the hood" of the
string_list API. And as opposed to being a simple wrapper, it could
assert that strdup_strings is set (we already do some similar assertions
in the split functions).
