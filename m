I don't even have an opinion yet. :)

Well, there was this line in the patch context:

    C_SOURCES = $(patsubst %.o,%.c,$(C_OBJ))

We invoke Coccinelle/spatch with the '--all-includes' option, see the
SPATCH_FLAGS make variable.  And it does indeed include header files:
I've seen it find something to transform in 'cache.h', and then the
resulting 'contrib/coccinelle/<whatever>.cocci.patch' included the
exact same transformation as many times as the number of files
including 'cache.h'... which is a lot :)

I don't really know what can cause 'spatch' to error out (besides
unknown command line option or non-existing file specified on the
command line), and this is all that 'man spatch' has to say:

       --all-includes
              causes all available include files to be used

Since it explicitly mentions _available_ include files, I would
venture to guess that non-available include files are not used, and
since it doesn't explicitly mention that such a file causes an error,
it doesn't.
