I agree with your reading; the most neutral mention "archive is
here" is not very friendly because the readers do not know what we
want out of them being aware of the archive.  "Ah, I may find a
solution already there" was the reaction I wanted to draw by saying
"If you want to check if the issue has been reported", but any of
the above is a good reaction.

And from that point of view

is just as good, and there is not a big difference between that and

this one, at least to me.

Yup, in short I think any one of the above three is good enough.
Let's just pick one and move on.  Unless somebody sends in an
improvement that can be applied readily, by default I'll just "git
am" the one Martin sent, as that is the easiest thing to do ;-).
