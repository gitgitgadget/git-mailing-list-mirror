Interestingly, I used the feature in real-life last week, and had to
think upside-down to type the right "good"/"bad" keywords ;-).

Right. There was still quite some work to do, but this is most likely
too small for a GSoC project. But that could be a part of it. I'm not
sure how google welcomes GSoC projects made of multiple small tasks, but
my experience with students is that it's much better than a single (too)
big task, and I think that was the general feeling on this list when we
discussed it last year.
