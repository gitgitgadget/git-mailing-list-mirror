This looks correct to me (and an improvement in readability). In
general, I wonder how many of the results from:

  git grep '{ OPTION'

could be converted to use the macros and end up more readable. There are
a number of OPTARG ones, which I guess can't use macros. Looks like
there are a handful of others (mostly for OPT_HIDDEN).
