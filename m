Git has been accepted to this year's Summer of Code program. At this
point, the list of accepted organizations has been published, and
students will start looking at ideas pages and communicating with
organizations about their plans. The actual application period starts on
March 28th. The full timeline is here:

  http://www.google-melange.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2011/timeline

In the meantime, we should be doing a few things:

  1. Make any last-minute adjustments or additions to the ideas page as
     soon as possible. Students will be looking at it and making
     decisions starting now. The page is at:

       https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/SoC2011Ideas

  2. Be on the lookout for students coming on the list to ask questions.
     Our SoC organization page lists #git and #git-devel on freenode as
     our irc point-of-contact, so we may get questions there, too.

  3. Potential mentors should sign up on the SoC site:

       http://www.google-melange.com/

     Even if you don't think you will end up mentoring (e.g., many
     people volunteered to do so if the right project came along) sign
     up if you would like to help rate student proposals.
