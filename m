I don't think it's a bug, though. You have told Git that you will
convert the contents (whatever their format) into the canonical format,
but your program to do so includes a CR.

We _could_ further process with other canonicalizations, but I'm not
sure that is a good idea (line-endings sound reasonably harmless, but
almost certainly we should not be doing clean/smudge filtering). And I'm
not sure if there would be any compatibility fallouts.

So I think the behavior is perhaps not what you want, but it's not an
unreasonable one. And the solution is to define your textconv such that
it produces clean LF-only output. Perhaps:

  [diff.whatever]
  textconv = "iconv ... | tr -d '\r'"

?
