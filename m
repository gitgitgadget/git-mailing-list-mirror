I had my first run-in with Theo just a month back, in which I was told
"You are clearly not skilled enough to even compile code".  I blogged
about it at <http://use.perl.org/~merlyn/journal/28032>, including
links to the entire mail exchange archive.

I now consider myself a "made man" on OpenBSD. :)
