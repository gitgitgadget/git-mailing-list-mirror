If you're running your list without munging Reply-to, congratulations
to you. I'll avoid it from now on on this list. However, it's the case
that for many, many lists out there, if I did not include myself in a
Reply-to, the list would set the Reply-to to the list, and most MUAs
would automatically exclude me from the reply.
