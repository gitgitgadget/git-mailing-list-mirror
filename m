While it might be the way other development communities work, in the
Git development community, we do not work that way when presenting
your second and subsequent attempt to the community.

Having the initial draft from the original developers that records
the bugs and misdesigns in an earlier parts of a series and separate
patches that record how the problems were fixed to arrive at the
final shape of the codebase might be interesting to the original
developers, and they may even find such a history valuable, but in
the context of the history that will be recorded in the official
tree of the project for eternity, that just adds useless noise.

Instead of keeping the original, in which problems were pointed out,
and adding later commits to correct them incrementally, a patch is
"rerolled".  That is, you are expected to learn from the review
comments and pretend as if you did the work from scratch and you
already possessed the wisdom lent by the reviewers when you started
your work.  In the "rerolled" patches you send, you pretend as if
you worked without making mistakes you made in the earlier rounds at
all, producing (more) perfect patches from the beginning.  

In reality, you may locally be using Git tools like rebase,
cherry-pick and "add -p" while preparing these "rerolled" rounds of
patches, but the name of the game is to hide that effort from the
public and pretend to be a perfect human, recording the result of
exercising your best ability in the official history ;-).

So this is OK:

    0/3: I want to improve X, and for that I identified that I need
    A, B and C done.  A or B alone is already an improvement, but A
    and B together makes it even more useful, and implementation of
    C requires patches to do A and B.

    1/3: do A
    2/3: do B
    3/3: do C, building on A and B

This is not:

    0/3: I want to improve X, and for that I need to do C.
    1/3: I couldn't do C, and I did A instead.
    2/3: A was totally useless. I fix it to do B.
    3/3: B is not very useful, either. I fix it to do C.
