I think we are going to consider ksh a lost cause. We have to move to bash because the ksh implementation does not support a large enough environment to run all of the tests, so are now running with:

make SHELL=/usr/coreutils/bin/bash

t0410 passes using bash so we'll stick with that rather than trying to patch ksh that won't run properly inside make as of 2.25.0 (we hit the environment size limit).

Thanks for the response.
