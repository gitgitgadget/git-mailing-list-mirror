I think that's what everyone is trying to do, the problem is when the
axiom "others will follow your example" fails.  In that case it is
important to address the issue.

It is equally important to do this in a way that does not assume malice
on the part of the reviewer. It is quite possible that when English is
not someone's first language then they may not realise how their words
are being interpreted by some people.  In this case a friendly message
sent off the mailing list may be appropriate.

It is subjective *to some degree*.  If a reviewer takes care, then it is
possible to write a message that minimises the risk that the words can
be interpreted in a way that is not what was intended.

If we do end up having community guidelines, then I think that point is
very important.  It is equally important that readers do not assume that
the tone in which they read an email is that in which it was intended
but I think that human nature makes that half harder.
