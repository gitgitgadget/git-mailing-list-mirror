This should probably lead with the reason for the patch (avoiding errors
with NDEBUG), and then mention any other bits (like "we also reorder for
clarity"). That makes the point of the patch easier to see.

I don't think you need MAYBE_UNUSED on "info"; it is always used, even
if the assert isn't compiled.

IMHO this would be better converted to:

  if (result)
	BUG("unable to parse output of get_committer_info()");

That solves the problem, avoids introducing head-scratching constructs
like MAYBE_UNUSED, and gives readers more of a clue about what we
expected.

PS I do think it's pretty ugly that we have to re-split the ident from
   git_committer_info(), which just took the individual pieces and
   stuffed them into a string! But our ident functions are a little
   cumbersome here (we even have fmt_name(), but I think it's too picky
   about IDENT_STRICT). I suspect it could be fixed with some
   refactoring, but that's way out of scope for your series (and for the
   reftable series itself), so let's leave it for now.
