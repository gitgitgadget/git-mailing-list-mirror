Dear Git Developers,

since 1974 researchers and software developers try to ease software
debugging. Over the last years, they created many new tools and
formalized methods. We are interested if these advancements have
reached professional software developers and how they influenced their
approach. To find this out, we are conducting an Online Survey for
Software Developers. From the results we expect new insights into
debugging practice that help us to suggest new directions for future
research. So if you are a software developer or know any software
developers, you can really help us.  The survey is, of course, fully
anonymous and will take about 15 minutes to fill out. Feel free to
redistribute this message to anyone who you think might be interested.
The survey can be reached at:

Thank you for your interest,
Benjamin Siegmund
