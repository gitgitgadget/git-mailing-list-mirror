Maybe:

/refs/imported/$GROUP/$USER/project -> $GROUP/$USER

or

/refs/imported/sandbox/$USER/$TOPIC/project -> $USER/$TOPIC

The issue, in my case, is importing from a system where branches contain 
projects instead of projects containing branches (and everything is a 
single namespace). So I want to match an insane (for us) LHS with a sane 
RHS to get stuff into reasonable shape. I don't really care about any 
patterns where the branch identifier is multiple components, but I 
wouldn't be surprised if somebody did.

Oh, and it looks like "?" is reserved and currently unused, so we could 
have * match one or more full path components, and ? match partial path 
components.
