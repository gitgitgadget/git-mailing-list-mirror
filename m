I have to admit that I'm slightly negative on this approach, just
because:

  1. It requires every caller to do something special, rather than just
     using normal redirection. And the feature isn't as powerful as
     redirection. E.g., some callers do:

       test_must_fail foo >output 2>&1

     But:

       test_must_fail stderr=output foo >output

     is not quite right (stdout and stderr outputs may clobber each
     other, because they have independent position pointers).

  2. The "-x" problems aren't specific to test_must_fail at all. They're
     a general issue with shell functions.

I'm not entirely happy with saying "if you want to use -x, please use
bash". But given that it actually solves the problems everywhere with no
further effort, is it really that bad a solution?

For the error messages from test_must_fail, could we go in the same
direction, and send them to descriptor 4 rather than 2? We've already
staked out descriptor 4 as something magical that must be left alone
(see 9be795fb). If we can rely on that, then it becomes a convenient way
for functions to make sure their output is going to the script's stderr.
