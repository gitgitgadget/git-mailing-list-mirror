I think the issue is in the exclude-promisor-object code paths of the
traversal. Try this:

  [two clones of git.git, one full and one partial]
  $ git clone --no-local --bare /path/to/git full.git
  $ git clone --no-local --bare --filter=blob:none /path/to/git partial.git

  [full clone is quick to traverse all objects]
  $ time git -C full.git rev-list --count --all
  63215
  real	0m0.369s
  user	0m0.365s
  sys	0m0.004s

  [partial is, too; it's the same amount of work because we're just
   looking at the commits here]
  $ time git -C partial.git rev-list --count --all
  63215
  real	0m0.373s
  user	0m0.364s
  sys	0m0.009s

  [but now ask it to exclude promisor objects, and it's much slower;
  this is because is_promisor_object() opens up each tree in the pack in
  order to see which "promised" objects it mentions]
  $ time git -C partial.git rev-list --exclude-promisor-objects --count --all
  0
  real	0m11.723s
  user	0m11.354s
  sys	0m0.369s

And I think that is the source for the memory use, too. Without that
option, we peak at 11MB heap. With it, 1.6GB. Oops. Looks like there
might be some "leaks" when we parse tree objects and then leave the
buffers connected to the structs (technically not a leak because we
still have the pointers, but obviously having every tree in memory at
once is not good).

The patch below drops the peak heap to 165MB. Still quite a bit more,
but I think it's a combination of delta-base cache (96MB) plus extra
structs for all the non-commit objects whose flags we marked.

It does seem like there's probably a good space/time tradeoff to be made
here (e.g., caching the list of "promisor" object ids for the pack
instead of inflating and reading all of the trees on the fly).
