Much better.

Because otherwise, you'd have to have another question:

	10a: Did you ever experience somebody on the mailing list who 
	     perfectly fits the profile described here:
	     http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/03/12/1449201

And admittedly, this has _nothing at all_ to do with Git.

Ciao,
