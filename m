Hello. We have started using Git and Cogito, and are very happy users so 
far. There's one thing that I haven't been able to figure out, however:

Suppose I've done a bunch of commits in my local repository that I have 
not yet pushed to the remote repository. How can I determine what has 
been cg-commit-ed but not yet cg-pushe-ed WITHOUT actually doing the 
cg-push?

Many thanks in advance for your help.
