For tracking my git configuration including .gitk, I used

[filter "dotgitk"]
        clean = fgrep -v geometry

together with an appropriate attribute for gitk.

I don't know how your autogenerated files differ, but maybe you can set
up a filter (or custom diff driver) which makes git think the files are
equal though they are not, just like in my case (ignoring window
geometry changes for gitk).
