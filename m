Ah :). All good points; thanks for your suggestions.

That's right, and certainly merits a mention in the documentation. I've
added that...

> What happens with OIDs that name non-existing objects?

...these are silently discarded. I think that you could make a
compelling argument in either direction on this one, but I'm slightly
swayed towards "discard these, too", since '--no-check-oids' is
literally saying "don't check these".

I guess that pushes us into the territory of whether or not "check" is
the right verb. "verify"? "scrutinize" :)? Do you have any thoughts
here?

If you're otherwise satisfied with this series, here's the updated
patch.

Subject: [PATCH] commit-graph.c: introduce '--[no-]check-oids'

When operating on a stream of commit OIDs on stdin, 'git commit-graph
write' checks that each OID refers to an object that is indeed a commit.
This is convenient to make sure that the given input is well-formed, but
can sometimes be undesirable.

For example, server operators may wish to feed the full commit object
IDs pointed to by refs that were updated during a push to 'git
commit-graph write --input=stdin-commits', and silently discard any
input that doesn't point at a commit. This can be done by combing the
output of 'git for-each-ref' with '--format %(*objecttype)', but this
requires opening up a potentially large number of objects.  Instead, it
is more convenient to feed the updated object IDs to the commit-graph
machinery, and let it throw out whatever remains.  to commits.

Introduce '--[no-]check-oids' to make such a behavior possible. With
'--check-oids' (the default behavior to retain backwards compatibility),
'git commit-graph write' will barf on a non-commit line in its input.
With '--no-check-oids', such lines will be silently ignored, making the
above possible by specifying this option.

No matter which is supplied, 'git commit-graph write' retains the
behavior from the previous commit of rejecting non-OID inputs like
"HEAD" and "refs/heads/foo" as before.
