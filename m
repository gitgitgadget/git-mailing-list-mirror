Thanks for the response, there is lots of good information there.

One clarification - can you track renames in git? I tried using git mv 
but from the status output it looks like it deleted the old file  and 
added the new file. I was expecting it to record some sort of indicator 
of the name change, instead it looks like a short-cut for delete & add, 
the docs aren't clear if that is the case.
