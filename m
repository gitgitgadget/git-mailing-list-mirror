the big problem is not that his page was removed, there's some problem 
around the fact that there was not hint to him that it wasn't allowed.

the big problem that I think many people see is that when he asked the 
admin why it was removed, instead of being given an explination (or 
ideally, beping pointed to an explination) his questions was deleted as 
being 'admin abuse' and he was banned, still without explination.

This thread has explored why the content he posted was not desrirable, but 
if you are banning someone, you should not assume that they know why you 
are banning them.
