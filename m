With all due respect, all of the designs you've posted look like =20
_weblog_ templates, and that doesn't seem appropriate to me for a =20
software website. One of the things I most dislike about the weblog =20
format is the fixed-width centre column and the large tracks of wasted =
=20
space down the sides; although the official site is certainly "bare =20
bones" (some would say "ugly") at the moment, at least the information =
=20
density is high and there isn't any wasted space.

Cheers,
Wincent
