Every piece of dwimmery is suggested by someone and usually backed by a few,
so it's likely wanted by many. Your ultra-conserative "works for *me*, so
shut up and stop trying to change things" means git really has to be flawless.
For you, that is. For others, there are still things to improve. I'd
appreciate if you could losen the "MY playpen" a little though, as it takes
an awful lot of energy from the constructive discussions.
