  no, that part is correct, it clearly(?) states that staged changes
are left where they are, in the index. i submit that the misleading
part is in the example i quoted, which suggests that only the "other"
changes are saved to the stash -- that is, the changes other than what
is already in the index.

  in that case, that's something that could obviously be clarified.

  i guess we can agree to disagree, since i think the snippet of the
example i provided gives a misleading explanation.
