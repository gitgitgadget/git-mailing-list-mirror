I think so.  Maybe you want to add that we are a very lively community, 
and that Git is so fast-moving that we regularly get feature requests that 
have been addressed already ;-)

... and high-quality enhancements to Git.

One challenge was that we had a third project, which was really 
interesting, and the student was really interested, too, but for political 
reasons he could not get the grant, and therefore the project had to be 
stopped.

.. v2 (I think by now there are enough parts limited to v2 that it does 
not matter how much is "or later, at the discretion of Linus Torvalds").
