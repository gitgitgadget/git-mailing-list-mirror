And that might be a mistake. Because "everyone" doesn't include the
people that are able to put personal differences aside, and
concentrate on technical merits.

It doesn't. And I don't.

There is no lack of openness from my part. I hear all technical
arguments, and I reply on a technical basis. The problem seems to be
is that you expect the code submitted to be criticized, but not the
criticism it receives. IOW; the submitter has to put up with anything
anybody says about his/her code and ideas, but the *reviewer* is
untouchable; the submitter cannot ever criticize the reviewer. I can
tell you that doesn't happen in the Linux kernel; the review process
is a _discussion_, not a one-way communication, and discussions can be
heated up, but the end result is better code, *both* sides are open to
criticism, the submitter, *and* the reviewer.

It seems to me that you think in the git mailing list the submitter
should never put in question the criticism of the reviewer.

If that's not the case, show me a single instance when I rebuke
technical arguments in *harsh* words... perhaps, you think any
rebuking is "harsh". Specifically, show me an instance were *I* was
harsh, and the reviewer was not.

If you cannot show instances of this, then your statement that I
rebuke harshly doesn't stand; I rebuke, that's all.

If a submitter cannot rebuke, why would I want to contribute to such a
project? If we cannot speak openly why would I want to contribute?

I wouldn't.

Nobody said otherwise.

Thanks, but no thanks. I contribute on my free time, and if
contributing is not a fun process, why would I?

It seems to me that you feel you are not only entitled to my code, but
to never criticize back. I've seen this happen multiple times now,
when I send patches, which are a *contribution*, and the reviewers
expect me to address every and all issues they raise without
criticizing back, or that somehow it's my *responsibility* to address
their concerns, even if I don't agree. I'm sorry but it's not.

In a truly technical project code speaks, and if you as a reviewer
feel something has to be changed, and the submitter (which is acting
on his/her own volition and free time) is not willing to do it, he/her
himself/herself can take the code and do whatever modifications to it,
or the commit message, seem necessary. *Not* to keep bashing the
submitter until they do it exactly as they want as if somehow it was
their *responsibility*.

The spirit of open source is *collaboration*, and what you seem to
expect here is that I do everything. Not only do I have to come up
with the code, I have to come up with a full book chapter of commit
message explaining all the history and introducing how the code works
to people unfamiliar with it, and I have to hear review criticism
without arguing back, and I have to implement it even if I disagree,
and I have to be careful about what every word I say might be taken by
people from other cultures (but they don't), and I can never say
anything that might under certain circumstances and assumptions be
considered offensive (even though they can). And never criticize back
the hidden guidelines.

This is not collaborative, this only ensures that you will get a very
specific kind of contributors.

If what you want is a closely-knitted circle of friends that are
like-minded, then this seems like the right approach.

If what you want is to have a good project, with good code, it might no=
t.

Cheers.
