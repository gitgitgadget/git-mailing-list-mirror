X-Warning: Original message contained 8-bit characters, however during
	   the SMTP transport session the receiving system did not announce
	   capability of receiving 8-bit SMTP (RFC 1651-1653), and as this
	   message does not have MIME headers (RFC 2045-2049) to enable
	   encoding change, we had very little choice.
X-Warning: We ASSUME it is less harmful to add the MIME headers, and
	   convert the text to Quoted-Printable, than not to do so,
	   and to strip the message to 7-bits.. (RFC 1428 Appendix A)
X-Warning: We don't know what character set the user used, thus we had to
	   write these MIME-headers with our local system default value.
