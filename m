Subject: [PATCH v3 1/7] builtin.h: take over documentation from api-builtin.txt

Delete Documentation/technical/api-builtin.txt and move its content
into builtin.h. Format it as a comment. Remove a '+' which was needed
when the information was formatted for AsciiDoc. Similarly, change
"::" to ":".

Document SUPPORT_SUPER_PREFIX, thereby bringing the documentation up to
date with the available flags.

While at it, correct '3 more things to do' to '4 more things to do'.

I'm still documenting SUPPORT_SUPER_PREFIX. As Junio pointed out, a
nearby patch series is working on losing it (or one user of it). I tried
removing that part, but felt like I was leaving things incomplete.

-builtin API
-===========
-
-Adding a new built-in
----------------------
-
-There are 4 things to do to add a built-in command implementation to
-Git:
-
-. Define the implementation of the built-in command `foo` with
-  signature:
-
-	int cmd_foo(int argc, const char **argv, const char *prefix);
-
-. Add the external declaration for the function to `builtin.h`.
-
-. Add the command to the `commands[]` table defined in `git.c`.
-  The entry should look like:
-
-	{ "foo", cmd_foo, <options> },
-+
-where options is the bitwise-or of:
-
-`RUN_SETUP`::
-	If there is not a Git directory to work on, abort.  If there
-	is a work tree, chdir to the top of it if the command was
-	invoked in a subdirectory.  If there is no work tree, no
-	chdir() is done.
-
-`RUN_SETUP_GENTLY`::
-	If there is a Git directory, chdir as per RUN_SETUP, otherwise,
-	don't chdir anywhere.
-
-`USE_PAGER`::
-
-	If the standard output is connected to a tty, spawn a pager and
-	feed our output to it.
-
-`NEED_WORK_TREE`::
-
-	Make sure there is a work tree, i.e. the command cannot act
-	on bare repositories.
-	This only makes sense when `RUN_SETUP` is also set.
-
-. Add `builtin/foo.o` to `BUILTIN_OBJS` in `Makefile`.
-
-Additionally, if `foo` is a new command, there are 3 more things to do:
-
-. Add tests to `t/` directory.
-
-. Write documentation in `Documentation/git-foo.txt`.
-
-. Add an entry for `git-foo` to `command-list.txt`.
-
-. Add an entry for `/git-foo` to `.gitignore`.
-
-
-How a built-in is called
-------------------------
-
-The implementation `cmd_foo()` takes three parameters, `argc`, `argv,
-and `prefix`.  The first two are similar to what `main()` of a
-standalone command would be called with.
-
-When `RUN_SETUP` is specified in the `commands[]` table, and when you
-were started from a subdirectory of the work tree, `cmd_foo()` is called
-after chdir(2) to the top of the work tree, and `prefix` gets the path
-to the subdirectory the command started from.  This allows you to
-convert a user-supplied pathname (typically relative to that directory)
-to a pathname relative to the top of the work tree.
-
-The return value from `cmd_foo()` becomes the exit status of the
-command.
