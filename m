Sure.  But being able to handle it in a way with which I as well as my
tools are already fluent is an advantage, for me.  "One separate
idiosyncratic tool for every job" does not cut it for me with regard
to user interfaces.  Which is part of the reason I am an Emacs user.
And even though you may want to see that breed interned, some of them
do useful things at times.
