Yeah, I noticed this when writing it, and the doubly-linked list was my
first thought. It's much more straight-forward than making guesses about
traversal order, and we already have a nice implementation in list.h.

What made me hesitate for this demonstration was that it turns the
removal into _two_ pointer updates. That made me more nervous about the
racy case where we get a single handler while already deleting
something. Specifically when we have "a <-> b <-> c" and we've updated
"a->next" to point to "c" but "c->prev" still points to "b".

But even with the singly-linked list we're not fully race-proof
(somebody could set *p to NULL between the time we look at it and
dereference it). What we really care about is not two versions of the
function running simultaneously, but one version getting interrupted by
another and having the second one see a sane state (because we'll never
return to the first signal handler; the second one will raise() and
die).

And I think we're fine there even with a doubly-linked list. It's still
the single update of the "next" pointer that controls that second
traversal.
