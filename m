I was calling it "gitt" for a long time, which is at least shorter and
easier to type.  I also thought of "tick" (anagram of tk + "ci" for
check in), but maybe all that shows I've been doing too many cryptic
crosswords lately. :)  The "gitool" was by analogy with the "citool"
of another system we've both used.  I'm happy to change it if someone
has a better idea...

Paul.
