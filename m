IMHO it's better to keep it as a size_t for as long as possible, and
then cast when we pass to printf, for a few reasons:

  1. The cast is made explicitly, so it calls attention to it.

  2. We know that a cast to int there can at worst produce truncated
     output, and not lead to any kind of memory error. (And if we really
     care about that, it's easy to convert it to an fwrite() at that
     point, though I would not bother in this case).

I think the comparison to "cols" is OK, because we are just checking
whether cols is smaller than us. If we assume that size_t is at least as
big as an int (which I think is a reasonable assumption to make, and
certainly holds true for all platforms I know) then there's no
possibility of logic errors.

I wouldn't even bother with a cast there. Probably -Wsign-compare would
complain, but we are pretty far from enabling that. And I think the
right solution is for term_columns() to return an unsigned, anyway. ;)

I admit all of this is academic enough that I can live with it either
way (there are definitely places where it is _not_ academic, so I am
mostly just trying to encourage a general style).
