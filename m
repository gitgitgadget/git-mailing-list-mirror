TBH, that does not seem like that compelling a reason to me to keep it
around. If no compiler is complaining of C99 for-loop declarations, then
maybe we should consider loosening our style. Or are we trying to be
kind of some unknown set of platform-specific compilers that we can't
feasibly hit in our CI?

I also note that fb9d7431cf mentions that -std=c90 doesn't work, because
there are other spots where we violate the standard (looks like "inline"
is a big one). But gcc with -std=gnu89 seems to compile just fine for
me, and does notice for-loop declarations. That's obviously totally
unportable, but it would be sufficient for a CI test.
