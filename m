I know I haven't chimed in yet - As for the mentor summit itself I
wouldn't mind attending, but if there are others who would like to go I
won't begrudge them attending.  That also said I live in the Bay area,
and while I think I'll change apartments at some point, if people want
to crash at my place I've got an air mattress and futon people are more
than welcome to occupy.
