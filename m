Thanks, I somehow didn't know about that (and didn't find it when
grepping around for similar cases, probably because "mkdir -p" no longer
appears in those cases ;) ).

I agree it's a better solution here. I'll send a v2 in a moment with
that.

(Ironically, that template requires "call" which is in make 3.81, but
the commit adding it didn't discuss that at all).

Not the end of the world, as we do clean out the contents, so "ls-files
-o" would not mention any leftover cruft. But I agree that we should
strive for "make clean" to be the opposite of "make" as much as
possible.

I'll add in a patch to v2.
