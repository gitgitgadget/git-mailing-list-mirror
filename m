This is clearly a desirable feature, and has been requested by several
people (including myself) looking to switch some large-ish histories
from an existing system to git.

If you'd like to look through git archives for some discussion of the
issues that would be involved here, look for "shallow clone".

There's a related proposal termed "lazy clone" for one that would pull
down missing objects as needed over the network.

My impression is that both things will eventually be implemented.
There's certainly nothing fundamental in git that will prevent them,
(though there will be some interesting things to resolve as a real
patch for this stuff is explored).
