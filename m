GitTogether has been hosted at Google's for quite some time :-)
Last one was in 2011 http://google-opensource.blogspot.co.uk/2011/12/gittogether-2011.html

It would be nice to have a joint conference again in the Bay Area.

P.S. Possibly you heard of the global crisis in Europe ... that means nobody goes on holiday for a whole month in August anymore ;-( Saving money is more the focus rather than spending it on holidays ;-)

Luca.
