I can be a co-mentor if needed, though there are currently no project o=
n the=20
wiki about parts of the code I know quite well (bisect, help, config, r=
efs,=20
GIT_TRACE). If someone has ideas in these areas that would be great.

I also can't be involved in projects on Windows or MacOS, as I use only=
=20
Linux at home. But otherwise I am willing to co-mentor any other projec=
t.

Thanks,
Christian.
