Brandon et al.,

 oops!  sorry, my bad.  apologies.  I'm well aware of
 this point.  if you look at my _other_ replies, you
 should see that they are Ok.

 the problem is the MTA at work insists on adding HTML
 "if you read this you are a criminal" b*s* attachments
 (at least 3 bads!).  the posts are (rightly) binned by
 majordomo.  so I've been posting from my gmail account
 (mostly), which is not intended for my work.  that's
 my private life, @&*%$(^!   so the posts go to my work
 account, and hence I must manually transfer data such
 as the CC's:

	list/cc ---> work --(fwd/reply, no cc)--> \
	   gmail --(compose reply, add cc)--> list+cc

 this is also why the threading is (probably) broken,
 and may be the reason for the "Re: Re: ..." nonsense
 (albeit I'm not sure just how that happens?), and/or
 sometimes replying to the "wrong" e-address.   ;-(

 I simply forgot.  sorry!  (this reply's from home,
 so I don't have at-hand the data you asked for.
 tomorrow.)  and yes, I know this reply is OT & long.

cheers!
