Yeah, I've noticed that myself, but decided to keep it, as this was
meant to be a quick re-arrangement of already existing description, and
be as short as at all possible, as lengthy descriptions tend to obscure
problems.

Being this way it shows how difficult it is to document flawed design. I
guess the author of --ff-only would think twice should --ff/--no-ff be
originally documented similarly to the rest of 2-way options. At least
he'd likely call it --only-ff, as:

--ff::
--no-ff::
--only-ff::

looks much better. Yeah, I do realize all this is historical and such...

... and I'm in even worse position here ;-)
