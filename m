Here's where I ended up, from a solution standpoint:

0. Make sure the git scripts you use are always trusted using your favourite technique
1. Wrap the clone in a such a script to do the next two steps to avoid the usual problems of forgetting things
2. The clone script should use "git -c name=value clone repo" for all clean/smudge values needed that would otherwise be in .git/config if we had one which we don't
3. Have the script create/update .git/config using "git config --local name value" with all of the same clean/smudge values for subsequent operations.

From there, it seems that the contents of the smudged files are always correct, assuming the filter works of course. It was the use of -c that makes this work.

Sound about right?

Cheers,
Randall
