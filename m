Thanks, this looks good to me overall.

I wondered if we should die() here, but walking over cruft may be more
friendly. The base64 case does the same, though it actually ignores the
bytes rather than copying them. Since this is never _supposed_ to
happen, it's hard to say what behavior would be preferable without
seeing a real-world broken case.
