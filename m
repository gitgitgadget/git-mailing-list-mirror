please go ahead and put a lot of the info that is in the GIT 
Documentation/ on the wiki. it's far easier to go to one site and browse 
around to find things then to run into issues where you have to go 
somewhere else (with different tools) to find the info.

even if you just put all the documentation files there, as-is (as text 
files even, no hyperlinks in them) they should still be there.
