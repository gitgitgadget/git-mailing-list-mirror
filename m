The documentation was fixed in 88093289cdc (Documentation: changed-path Bloom
filters use byte words, 2020-05-11).

This is a good point, and certainly the reason for 8-byte multiples.

I'm not sure this is a valid requirement. Even extremely large repositories
(that are created by actual use, not synthetic) are on the scale of 2^24
commits.

You are right that we should make the commit-graph write process more robust
to reaching these limits. You point out that we have a new limit when these
filters are enabled.

For reference, the Windows OS repo has ~4.25 million commits and the
commit-graph file with changed-path Bloom filters is around 520mb. That's
the whole file size, and without the filters it's around 240mb, so the
filters are taking <300mb ~ 2^29 and we would need to grow the repo by 8x
to hit this limit. That's not an unreasonable amount of growth, but is
also far enough away that we can handle it in time.

The incremental commit-graph can actually save us here (and is similar to
how we solved a scale issue in Azure Repos around the multi-pack-index):
we can refuse to merge layers of an incremental commit-graph if the
changed-path filters would exceed the size limit. Of course, the _first_
write of such a commit-graph would need to be aware of this limit and
plan for it in advance, but that's also a theoretical issue.

I'm tracking some follow-up work [1] for the changed-path filters,
including a way to limit the number of filters computed in one
"git commit-graph write" process. I'll make note of your concerns here,
too.

That message includes very detailed experimental analysis, which is nice.
We will need to do some concrete side-by-side comparisons to see if there
actually is a meaningful difference. (You may have already done this.)

The ideal number depends also on what false-positive rate you want. In a
hypothetical future where we want to allow customization here, we want
the filters to be consistently sized across all filters.

This is currently due to a hard-coded value in the implementation. It's not a
requirement of the file format.

Worth fixing, but we are not in a rush. I noted it in my GitHub issue.
