Dear list,

I just had a giggle and thought I'd share it with you.

By pure chance, I stumbled upon this project: 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/javagit/.  It sports 12 members, has a 
Subversion repository (!) and aims to simplify working with Git using Java 
by providing an easy API to the Git commands.

It seems to be pretty close to http://sourceforge.net/projects/gitclipse, 
which has only 8 members, however.  At least they do something very new, 
namely bringing Git to Eclipse. ;-)

Of course, all that without so much as saying "Hi" on the Git mailing 
list.  Tsk, tsk.

Ciao,
Dscho "who's whistling 'jgit, egit, jgit, egit, jaaaay-git!'"

P.S.: It is also quite a miracle to me how javagit can be LGPL, being 
pretty much tied to Git, which is GPL.  And it is an even bigger miracle 
to me how gitclipse, linking to javagit, can be EPL...
