For what it's worth, (and in case it wasn't obvious) this came about
because we feed '--stdin-commits' at GitHub, and observed exactly this
error case. I wasn't sure what approach would be more palatable, so I
prepared both in my fork at https://github.com/ttaylorr/git:

  - Branch 'tb/commit-graph-dont-check-oids' drops this checking
    entirely.

  - Branch 'tb/commit-graph-check-oids-option' adds a
    '--[no-]check-oids', in case that this is generally desirable
    behavior, by offering an opt-out of this OID checking.

Please let me know if you find either of these to be good options, and
I'll happily send one of them to the list. Thanks.
