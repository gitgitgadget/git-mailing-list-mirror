False alarm. Of course, if you want to help... for example some of those
magazines, journals, blogs, news sites use form submission, and not via
email.

Requirements for survey site: single answer and multiple answer
questions, single line and textarea answers. It would be nice
to have select form for the state, and for the language but it
is not required. I'd rather it not be heavyweight.

I'd like for it to have place for comment to question (which will
not be present in the summary), like example answers or explanation
of question. It would be nice to have questions divided into sections.

Any other proposals?
