Very understandable :-)

FWIW I think the script was quite well-structured (within the
limitations of shell scripting anyway) and I had no problem
understanding it and translating it to Python.

Thanks.  Given that you submitted the original version under GPLv2, and
later contributors certainly had no reason to assume any *other*
license, I think any reasonable person will be satisfied that the whole
script in its current form is under GPLv2.

Personally, I am satisfied by your email statement.  I will leave the
derived work, git-multimail, also under GPLv2.  Assuming that
git-multimail supersedes yours, its explicit choice of license will make
the situation clear for future users.

Thanks!
Michael
