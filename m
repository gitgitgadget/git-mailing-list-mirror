I think there is at least one thing to fix: rev-parse never learned
about --end-of-options. It also seems to have some weirdness around
"--".

Here's a series which fixes it.

  [1/3]: rev-parse: don't accept options after dashdash
  [2/3]: rev-parse: put all options under the "-" check
  [3/3]: rev-parse: handle --end-of-options
