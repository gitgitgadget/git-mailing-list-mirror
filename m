There is also cover letter and interdiff, and one would want to
be able to comment also on those.

So how notedb solve problem of in-diff comments, in-commit comments,
post-commit comments, whole series cover letter and cover-letter
comments, interdiff and interdiff message / comments?


Nb. GitHub Pull Requests include only some of those, compared to
the mailing list / Usenet news interface.

I wonder if we could use 'parent' header of a commit message for this,
or equivalent...

...which is as easy to set up and use as mailing list, for sending
patches, applying patches, and patch review.  And/or provide 
bi-directional interface to the mailing list (I think Debian 
infrastructure tries to be (inter)operable by email).

There are various federated technologies (like pump.io), the
problem might be their popularity.

I think there are command-line tools that allow to submit comments
to GitHub.
