I was not assuming you were saying this, as it has been discussed and
agreed upon when --diff-merges=first-parent was introduced, though I
think I now see your point more clearly.

I think I do now understand what you mean, yet I have alternative view
on the issue.

Actually, this happens to be exactly one of intended use-cases for "-d".
It's useful to see how some change introduced by the merge looked in the
context of the original commit, or to figure where the change came from.

The exact order is orthogonal to the issue at hands, I think.

Sorry, "-d â‰¡ --first-parent --patch" you suggest contradicts my view on
the whole scheme of things, for several reasons:

* I still find it problematic if -d, intended to fit nicely among --cc,
-c, -d, -m, -p, --remerge-diff options, suddenly implies --first-parent.
This would bring yet another inconsistency, and I don't want to be the
one who introduced it.

* In its current state -d conveniently means: "gimme simple diff output
for everything", where --first-parent you suggest doesn't fit at all.

* Current -d implementation is semantically as close to -p as possible,
tweaking exactly one thing compared to -p: the format of output for
merge commits, so is simpler than what you suggest from all angles, as
--first-parent tweaks more than one thing.

* To me what you argue for looks mostly like a desire to have a
short-cut for "--first-parent --patch", and my patch in question does
not seem to contradict this desire, as it'd be very surprising if
somebody came up with the name "-d" for such a short-cut. Definitely not
me.

* Finally, if -d becomes "--patch --first-parent", how do I get back
useful "--patch --diff-merges=first-parent" part of it, provided
--first-parent is unreversable? And even if it were reversable, then

   git log -d --no-first-parent =
   git log --patch --first-parent --no-first-parent =
   git log --patch

is definitely not what is needed, nor frequent demand to revert implied
things indicates optimal design. Compare this to

   git log -d --first-parent

that current -d provides for you to get what you need, and that
unambiguously reads: "gimme *d*iff for all commits while following
*first parent* through the history" (while, unlike, -p not requiring
--first-parent to implicitly tweak diff for merges output).

Overall, after considering your concern, I'd still prefer to leave "-d"
semantics as implemented, consistent with the rest of similar options,
and let somebody else define more shortcuts for their frequent use-cases
if they feel like it.

Thanks,

P.S. I also figure that maybe our divergence comes from the fact that I
consider merge commits to be primarily commits (introducing particular
set of changes, and then having reference to the source of the changes),
whereas you consider them primarily merges (joining two histories, and
then maybe some artificial changes that make merges "evil"). That's why
we often end up agreeing to disagree, as both these points of view seem
pretty valid.
