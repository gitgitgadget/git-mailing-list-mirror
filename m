I fixed that here by manually dragging the "date" column to the left.

That had the bonus effect of moving the graph away from the edge of the
window, so it was easier to see the left-most line.

You can also just resize the column if it bugs you.  (Though I think
swapping the default order of the two columns is probably worthwhile
anyway.)
