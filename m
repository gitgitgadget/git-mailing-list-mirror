I haven't done anything on it in ages (you probably have my latest 
version), and I never really got the export code to do all of the special 
things needed at my site. I haven't really been following all of the 
latest stuff Sverre's been doing, but I should still be able to explain 
things about the C and Perforce stuff if you have questions on that front.
