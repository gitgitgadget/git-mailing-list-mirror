OK, something I've thought of doing anyways in the past...

Exactly on being conceptually simple but requiring some deeper
changes to the way indexing works.  I'll have to think about it
a bit, but it should be doable without being too intrusive,
invasive or expensive for existing users.

Thanks.  I'll keep that index change in mind and it should be
doable if I remain alive and society doesn't collapse...

Yeah, that would be part of the local tools bit I've been
thinking about (user labels such as "important", "seen",
"replied", "new", "ignore", ... flags).
