Hi

I have been looking through the scripts, but cannot find out whether when 
running: git pull, checkout-cache will be run if the tree is different.

My main question is, if there is a new version on the git server, and i do a 
git pull, will this update the source files.  Do I have to carry out some 
more commands in order for this to happen?

Sorry if this is a really newb question, but hopefully I should catch up soon!

Rhys
