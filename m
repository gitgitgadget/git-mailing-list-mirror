I didn't think about that when I posted my scripts. In general, it's OK
to me if you miss a script when you generate the "leaky" list. But if
you skip it, you cannot say whether it is leaky or not, and should
probably neither add nor remove it from the known-leaky list. So I think
the second shell snippet needs to become a little more clever about
skipped test scripts.

Even that isn't 100% fool-proof, as some individual tests may be skipped
or not skipped on various platforms. But it may be enough in practice
(and eventually we'd have no known-leaky tests, of course ;) ).

Or alternatively, we could just not bother with checking this into the
repository, and it becomes a local thing for people interested in
leak-testing. What's the value in having a shared known-leaky list,
especially if we don't expect most people to run it.

I guess it lets us add a Travis job to do the leak-checking, which might
get more coverage. So maybe if we do have an in-repo known-leaky, it
should match some canonical Travis environment. That won't give us
complete coverage, but at this point we're just trying to notice
low-hanging fruit.
