Yeah, I guess I am confused. I thought "Fixing --graph to avoid implying 
ancestry" was reaching the same point as "care must be taken to ensure 
that [commits without parents shown] do not appear to have parents". (I 
wasn't just talking about root commits at that point)

I understand. Coming back to the "root commit" situation below.

Okay

I'll come back to this below.

I thought about that, but can we handle any of the three markers being 
multi-byte characters?

I'm thinking on that one. I need to learn more about --left-right. I 
don't know how/when to use it yet.

So, on the root vs parents-not-shown commits issue:

You're right. Commits with their parents hidden by the range specifiers 
have the same graphing issue as root commits.

While root commits are not a special case in the sense that --graph 
makes ancestor implications for more than just root commits, root 
commits are a special case when we think about interpreting the presence 
of hidden lineage in --graph output.

Considering one of your examples:

           C
          /
         O---A---B
                  \
           X---Y---Z

When graphing C..Z, git produces output like:

*   0fbb0dc (HEAD -> z) Z
|\
| * 11be529 (master) B
| * 8dd1b85 A
* 851a915 Y
* 27d3ed0 (x) X

We cannot tell from the above graph alone that X is a root and A is not.

So I think it might be useful if I could do --mark-roots='#' 
--mark-hidden-lineage=$'\u22ef' (Unicode Midline Horizontal Ellipsis) to 
produce the following:

*   0fbb0dc (HEAD -> z) Z
|\
| * 11be529 (master) B
| â‹¯ 8dd1b85 A
* 851a915 Y
# 27d3ed0 (x) X

Alternatively, it could be argued that --boundary can be used to 
indicate a hidden lineage, since root commits do not have boundary 
commits listed below them. But --boundary draws one more commit than 
necessary, and there still isn't an easy way to search for roots in the 
pager.

I understand that I am now leaving the original scope of the issue, but 
I think it is worth considering.

Of course, I would also like to try fixing the original graphing issue 
in general.

Thoughts?
