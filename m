Yeah, your conversion looks accurate. I do wonder if it is worth golfing
further, though. If it were a process invocation per object, I'd
definitely say the efficiency gain is worth it. But dropping one process
from the whole test isn't that exciting either way.

The one thing I do like is that we don't have to escape anything inside
an awk program that is forced to use double-quotes. ;)

No, for the reasons I said in the commit message: if an object exists in
multiple places the test is already potentially invalid, as Git does not
promise which version it will use. So it might work racily, or it might
work for now but be fragile. By not de-duplicating, we make sure the
test's assumption holds.

Yeah, I briefly considered whether it would be possible in pure shell,
but didn't get very far before assuming it was going to be ugly. Thank
you for confirming. ;)

Again, if we were doing one awk per object, I'd try to avoid it. But
since we can cover all objects in a single pass, I think it's OK.
