Frankly, that sounds a bit overboard to me. If people want to profile
there are profiling tools. If we want users to profile on their systems
and send results to us, I think I'd rather give them instructions or a
wrapper script for doing so.

Yes, as long as they are strict improvements. I can't think of a case
where some sorting behavior is a matter of opinion, and they'd prefer
Git behave like the rest of their system rather than like Git on other
systems[1].

[1] I wonder the same about regex implementations. I generally consider
    our GNU regex fallback to be a strict improvement over system
    versions, at least in terms of features. But I was interested to see
    recently that musl implements pcre-style "\x" as an extension, but
    it _doesn't_ do REG_STARTEND. So it's at tradeoff. They have to use
    the fallback on newer versions of git (to get REG_STARTEND), but
    that means the rest of their system understands "\x" but Git does
    not.
