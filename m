As I mentioned already in my previous mail, it is not an issue but we p=
resently use it with svn in a positive way.
Say 5 designer are working with same template, but in different section=
=2E So it is very easy to understand who is working on what
and also these 5 designers can see/review the codes among them and how =
previous code effect their work. So this features are exploited here wi=
th that positive
direction.=20
