We've just pushed out an update to the Network Graph on GitHub this
evening that finally allows us to draw very large repositories
(including Git). We're mirroring the Git repo on the site and I
thought it might be interesting for people to see this visualization.
Enjoy!

Let me know if you have any ideas for improvements on the graph. I'm
always looking for ways to enhance it.
