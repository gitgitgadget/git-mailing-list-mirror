Hello,

I'm a Sr. Software Quality Assurance Engineer at Epocal Inc. in Ottawa, Ontario,
Canada.  We are a medical device manufacturer that is required to comply with
the Food & Drug Administration's (FDA) regulations.
I'm in charge of what is known as Non-Product Software, essentially any piece of
SW that is used in the day-to-day work of creating our products.
Part of complying with the FDA regulations is to ensure that all Non-Product Software
has been validated.

Some of our engineers are planning on using your software "Git" for their software
development processes (latest version) to replace our current software "SVN" and I was 
hoping you could answer some questions for me?

Are you able to provide me with a copy of your Test Plans and/or Test Cases for the "Git" product?

Is the software FDA certified?

Please contact me with your reply and/or any questions you have.

Thank you,
Todd Robertson
Sr. Software QA Engineer
Epocal Inc.
Ottawa, Ontario, Canada
