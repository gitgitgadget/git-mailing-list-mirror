I totally understand David' side! Synopsys is a well-known IP Vendor, and for a
long time its focus was the IP only. Knowadays the strategy has changed and
Synopsys is very keen to help in Open Source, namelly Linux, developing the
drivers for new IP Cores and participating in the improvement of existing ones.
I am part of the team that has that job.

In USB and PCI subystems developers created common Synopsys drivers (focused on
the HW IP) and so today they are massively used by all the SoC that use Synopsys
IP.

In the network subsystem, there are some drivers that target the same IP but
were made by different companies. stmmac is an excelent driver for Synopsys MAC
10/100/1000/QOS IPs, but there was another driver made by AXIS driver that also
targeted the QOS IP. We detected that issue and merged the AXIS specific driver
ops to stmmac, and nowadays, AXIS uses stmmac. So less drivers to maintain!

The idea that was rejected consisted of renaming stmicro/stmmac to dwc/stmmac
and to have dwc (designware controllers) as the official driver spot for
Synopsys Ethernet IPs.
There is another example of duplication, which is AMD' and Samsung' XGMAC
driver, targeting the same Synopsys XGMAC IP.

I am giving this examples because although the refactor adds work for
backporting, it reduces the maintenance since we would have less duplicated
drivers as we have today.

Thanks,
Joao
