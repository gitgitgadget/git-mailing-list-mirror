Clearvision have released a full bi-directional integration for IBM
Rational ClearCase to Git named the CC2GIT Bridge.

The ClearCase Git Integration allows developers to quickly and easily
transport code between the two tools, enabling one continuous
integrated SCCM environment with the reduced costs associated with
open source software.

Looking to Migrate? The CC2Git bridge allows companies to perform a
controlled migration within longer timescales, learning and resolving
dependencies as they arise, using live data but without impacting on
project teams.

Need a Hybrid SCCM environment?  Many organisations have IBM Rational
ClearCase deeply embedded in their development environment and need to
maintain this but wish to leverage the agility and distributed feature
set of Git.  The CC2Git Bridge provides a multisite solution between
IBM Rational ClearCase and Git, providing the best of both worlds.
