It would be nice if we had a good way to verify this automatically, but
I couldn't think of one. It passes the test suite with ASan, but of
course our coverage is not 100%.

We do know a few things:

  1. Any caller which keeps a pointer to the object-entries themselves
     is already broken, since we free that already. We only have to care
     about the name and path strings.

  2. Any caller which uses add_object_array() has a NULL path, so we
     don't have to worry about leaving that dangling.

  3. Most of the callers outside of revision.c use a NULL name argument,
     as well.

So let's see:

These ones always have NULL names and paths, so are good.

(An orthogonal low-hanging fruit: these probably ought to use
OBJECT_ARRAY_INIT instead of memset. Maybe a good #leftoverbits for some
of the Outreachy applicants).

This one gets the entries from setup_revisions(), so they may have
actual names. It calls diff_flush() before the clear, though, so I'm
pretty sure we would have dropped any queued entries (and I'm also
pretty sure that the queued entries make their own copies of any names
anyway). So this one isn't trivial, but I think it's fine.

Another always-NULL case.

This one is fed by the "result" array of find_first_merges(), which is
also always-NULL.

Also always NULL.

So I think all of these cases are good (and weren't actually leaking in
the first place, since the only thing to get rid of was the entries
themselves).

This confused me for a minute, since the leak is not visible in the
context. ;) But reading the next commit, it makes sense.
