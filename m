If you ask IBM PR, I'm sure they will be able to give you the reasons
they don't allow IBM employees to talk to Dan.

Yeah, and because I wasn't allowed to talk to him, he wrote a funny
(well, funny to me at least) article about how IBM was muzzling their
Linux developers.  It was quite accurate, and I've not had any problems
in dealing with him since I left IBM (probably due to my current
employer allowing me to talk to him...)
