Nowadays you can change the names for 'old' and 'new' with
`git bisect terms`.  HTH.

Good to know about this problem.

Anyway, I don't think it is feasible to weaken the assumption that there
is only one transition from 'old' ('good') to 'new' ('bad'); this is
what allows O(log(N)) operations.  See bisection method of root finding,
that is finding zeros of a continuous function.
