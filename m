Dear Admin,
I am using git along with github since august 2011. I am new to it but
now I know it significantly. It is interesting and helpful.
I have started with a already existing project (say P). We were two
persons working on this project, so we forked P (on github). I got
project forked copy C1 and my friend got C2. We each have committed to
C1 and C2 independently. Now my friend merged his commits from C2 to P
and moved out of this project. I have created a branch OLD in my
repository C1 along with a already existing master branch. What I want
to do that in my project C1, OLD branch should have all of my commits
and master branch should be same as P. Please tell how should I do
this? I am trying since a week to get it done, I have attempted some
unsuccessful tries, which I can tell you if you want. If you need more
information, please tell me.

Hope to get response.
I shall be thankful.
Manoj Soni
