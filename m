I don't think the Git committee has discussed that one. I'll mention it
there.

I wouldn't get hung up on the "is it a strict portmanteau" question. I
think the more important question is whether it creates confusion about
endorsement or interoperability. The portmanteau thing is more of a rule
of thumb there. (That's all IMHO, of course, and not an official
statement of the committee).
