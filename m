Thanks, this part looks obviously correct.

This one takes a bit more digging. I've been bitten before in Git's code
by freeing what appeared to be a leak only to find out that we had
passed the pointers off to some other data structure which expected them
to persist.

Here we feed them to set_helper_option(), which passes them to
quote_c_style(), which makes a copy into a strbuf. So I think all is
well.
