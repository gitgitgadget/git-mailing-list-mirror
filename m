Nice. Two other side effects, both of which I think are good:

 - this is likely faster for a large skiplist due to fewer syscalls

 - this will no longer complain about a sha1 with a missing newline at
   the end-of-file (it will quietly handle it as if the newline were
   there)

And one I'm not sure about:

 - a read() error will now be quietly ignored; I guess we'd have to
   check ferror(fp) to cover this. I'm not sure if it matters.

Code itself looks good to me (assuming we don't care about the read()
error thing).
