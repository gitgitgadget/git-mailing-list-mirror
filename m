The file git-logo.png as separate file was added by Martin Waitz in
281f2f6 (gitweb: use out-of-line GIT logo., 2006-07-31), but it was
just extracting file that was earlier created by gitweb with
'git-logo.png' action.

If you go back in history, you would notice that gitweb started to
generate it correctly in 8f1deb5 (set logo output to raw mode,
2005-11-23) by Kay Sievers, was converted from octal to hex in 
b87d78d (v107, 2005-08-07), with the following comment
  # cat git-logo.png | hexdump -e '16/1 " %02x"  "\n"' | sed 's/ /\\x/g'
and that before being embedded in gitweb (being generated by gitweb)
in 44ad297 (v014, 2005-08-07) it was simply git_logo.png file (back
then a separate file).  I _think_ that link to git_logo.png first
appeared in 4c02e3c (v000, 2005-08-07), which was second commit for
gitweb.

>From examining file with 'identify -verbose' from ImageMagick you can

  Version: ImageMagick 6.2.2 05/24/06 Q16
(I guess that mean 24 June 2005, not 24 May 2006).

That doesn't help (much) to get to know who is the author of
git_logo.png, and what license it is under.  I expect it to be GPLv2
(or GPLv2 or later) licensed, like the rest of Git.
