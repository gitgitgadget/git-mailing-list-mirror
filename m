I'm sorry it wasn't my intent to split the group but make it more
diverse. There has been some good points made though. I was thinking
more along the lines that the forum would kind of be an offshoot of
what's happening in the blogosphere as a lot of Git discussion happens
and occurs separate of this list and I was thinking of some place they
could group together and chat. Of course here is a good spot but most
seem to know about this list but choose to talk outside of it. I was
just hoping that the forum would help those people. Dylan.
