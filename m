Heh. Sneakernet. "The throughput of a truck-full of tapes..."

But it probably would work in this case. Chris - where in the world are 
you? Maybe somebody with bandwidth can indeed just pick up a DVD, and then 
make it available to the rest of us through the net (possibly even though 
a non-public URL - I suspect that Ted is right, and there's only a few 
people who would actually want to download 3GB to play with).

I was *not* planning on downloading a 48GB KDE archive to then run it 
through some strange contortions, but I'd love to just download 3GB 
overnight..
