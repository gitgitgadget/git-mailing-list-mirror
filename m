Thanks for the information. I do use the filtering of Gmail, but I
remember back when I used a non-GUI client I had all sorts issues with
mapping the newly made Gmail directories with folders on my system. I
believe you have to configure one each time, which is fine when you
don't have to do it too, often but I had given up after the third time.

I appreciate the utility of GitGitGadget, and I thought I'd end up using
that when contributing, but I found email to be simpler and more
intuitive (at the time, it felt less intimidating to use).
