I think that makes sense; perhaps an X-Git-Followups: header
from send-email which lists the child Message-IDs the same way
References: does for ancestors.  (perhaps there's already a
standardized header for listing children)

I thought about allowing a giant MIME message with all the
patches attached, too but that won't work for a large patch
series due to size limits along various SMTP hops.
Compression might make spam filters unhappy, too.

ought to already work for news.gmane.org and news.public-inbox.org

The Net::NNTP Perl module is a standard part of the Perl distro
for many years, now (along with Net::SMTP), so that would not
be a roadblock for implementing a custom downloader distributed
with git.

I would be hesitant to depend too much on public-inbox.org until
more mirrors appear.  Even then, NNTP is a better-established
protocol and a fallback to news.gmane still works.
(public-inbox.org is powered by hamsters running on wheels,
 sometimes I let them rest :)
