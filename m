The Contributor Summit is only a few days away; I'd like to work out a
few bits of logistics ahead of time.

We're up to 26 attendees. The room layout will probably be three big
round-tables, with a central projector. We should be able to have
everybody pay attention to a single speaker, or break into 3 separate
conversations.

The list of topics is totally open. If you're coming and have something
you'd like to present or discuss, then propose it here. If you're _not_
coming, you may still chime in with input on topics, but please don't
suggest a topic unless somebody who is there will agree to lead the
discussion.

We'll write the final list on a whiteboard on Thursday morning, vote on
what looks good, and then work our way down the list.  Topics don't
_have_ to be proposed here ahead of time, but I'd encourage people to do
so as it leaves time for others to consider them and possibly do any
background thinking or research.

The rough schedule is:

  0830 to 0930 - registration, breakfast, milling about and socializing;
                 be aware that Git Merge Workshop attendees will be
		 doing the same things in the same space, so show up
		 with enough time to navigate a bit of a crowd.

  0930 to 1215 - we retire to our Fortress of Solitude to talk about
                 Very Important Git Things

  1215 to 1330 - lunch

  1330 to 1500 - Very Important Git Things, part deux. The end time
		 isn't a hard deadline, so we can go as late as 1600 if
		 the discussion keeps up.

There's no organized dinner planned. At our size, I think it's probably
most productive to let people form small groups for dinner if they want
to. But if somebody is really interested in trying to do a big group
reservation, they are welcome to try to organize it.
