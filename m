This is such a huge change, for something that not many people want.  
Actually, you seem to be the first.

And you could just as well write a script that takes the output of

	$ git log --pretty=format:%an\ %ae --all | sort | uniq

and constructs a valid .mailmap.  That would also have the advantage that 
you do not need to perform the analysis each time you call Git.

All these reasons make me believe that your patch should not be applied.

Sorry,
Dscho
