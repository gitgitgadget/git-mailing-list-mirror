Here's a v2 which addresses the feedback on the last round (thank you
both). In particular:

  - the rabbit hole goes one deeper, as fixing the midx bug reveals that
    the revindex code just assumes that the pack .idx has been loaded.
    Patch 2 corrects this, which addresses most of the test failures
    with GIT_TEST_MULTI_PACK_INDEX.

  - There was one other failure, which is that t5570 corrupted a .idx
    and expected us to notice (which no longer happens when the midx is
    able to provide the answer). I've tweaked the test to address this.

  - I took RenÃ©'s suggestion of making midx_contains_pack() friendlier
    by handling either a .pack or a .idx argument. I had to tweak the
    suggested code just a little, and I added comments, since it took me
    a little staring to make sure everything was correct.

    I split that out from the basename fix, so that's now patches 5 and
    6. It also lets us drop the patch to factor out pack_name_to_idx().

Other than that, it's substantially the same as v1. I did move the
public declaration of pack_basename() to the patch where it is added,
rather than doing it later, which shows up in the range diff below.

    -    When we have a .midx that covers many packfiles, we try to avoid opening
    -    the .idx for those packfiles. However, there are a few problems with the
    -    filename comparison we use:
    +    When we have a multi-pack-index that covers many packfiles, we try to
    +    avoid opening the .idx for those packfiles. To do that we feed the pack
    +    name to midx_contains_pack(). But that function wants to see only the
    +    basename, which we compute using strrchr() to find the final slash. But
    +    that leaves an extra "/" at the start of our string.
     
    -      - we ask midx_contains_pack() about the .pack name, not the .idx name.
    -        But it compares to the latter.
    +    We can fix this by incrementing the pointer. That also raises the
    +    question of what to do when the name does not have a '/' at all. This
    +    should generally not happen (we always find files in "pack/"), but it
    +    doesn't hurt to be defensive here.
     
    -      - we compute the basename of the pack using strrchr() to find the
    -        final slash. But that leaves an extra "/" at the start of our
    -        string; we need to advance past it.

    -        have a slash at all. This should generally not happen (we always
    -        find files in "pack/"), but it doesn't hurt to be defensive here.
    +    Let's wrap all of that up in a helper function and make it publicly
    +    available, since a later patch will need to use it, too.
     
         The tests don't notice because there's nothing about opening those .idx
         files that would cause us to give incorrect output. It's just a little
         slower. The new test checks this case by corrupting the covered .idx,
         and then making sure we don't complain about it.
     
    +    We also have to tweak t5570, which intentionally corrupts a .idx file
    +    and expects us to notice it. When run with GIT_TEST_MULTI_PACK_INDEX,
    +    this will fail since we now will (correctly) not bother opening the .idx
    +    at all. We can fix that by unconditionally dropping any midx that's
    +    there, which ensures we'll have to read the .idx.
