In fact, many German terms and words are "forbidden area" since Nazi
times, but I don't think this one carries the same connotation.

But that is a side track.

Collaboration (and code review is a form of collaboration) requires
communication. The linked code of conduct pages describe quite well how
to ensure a productive environment in which "everyone" feels comfortabl=
e
communicating and collaborating. But even reading pages like these
requires a common sense (of the many undefined terms therein), a sense
which is usually present here on the list, and thus renders a page like
these unnecessary for us. Once there is a lack of commonality, there is
a lack of agreement about those undefined terms (what constitutes a
personal attack etc.).

Consequently, the only practical test for commonality and community
acceptance appears to be just that: commonality and community
acceptance. If many people in a community consider a tone or formulatio=
n
offensive, then it is offensive by the very definition of common sense
(common to that community), and there's no point at all in arguing abou=
t
it. If I don't like a community's sense I either deal with it or leave =
it.

It's really not that different from coding style. If we prefer

if (cond) {

over

if (cond)
{

then you either do it that way or your code gets rejected. The
difference is that coding style is easier to define, of course. The
common thing is that there's no point in arguing about it.
