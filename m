Hi,

I have no idea what the problem could be, but maybe I will be lucky
with my suggestions.

signal() is calling sigaction() so sigaction() must be called with
different parameters in your patch and when it crashes.
Could you have a look at the difference between parameters?

Could you try some variants that revert or change parts of this commit?

=46or example you could revert only this hunk:

Yeah but it would be nice to understand.

Thanks in advance,
