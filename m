Hey Scott, thanks.  FWIW, Google doesn't co-sponsor events.  So if we
do host it, we'll cover everything like we did last year, but maybe
GitHub can sponsor an off-site dinner again, like it did last year.
But perhaps this year you guys could select the venue for that.  :-)

Anyway, today is not the best day to go asking for budget and time
from LH (big GSoC announcement today).  Give me a week or two to
figure out if Google can host us here or in Portland.  FWIW, last
year Portland around the Linux Plumbers conference was tossed out
as an option, but it was too close calendar wise to be possible
for planning purposes.
