All the operations you mentioned are slow because they all cause filter
process invocations. I benchmarked the new filter protocol and it is 
almost 70x faster when switching branches on my local machine (i7, SSD, 
OS X) with a test repository containing 12,000 files that need to be 
filtered. 
Details here: https://github.com/github/git-lfs/pull/1382

Based on my previous experience with Git filter invocations I expect even
more dramatic results on Windows (I will benchmark this, too, as soon as
the list agrees on this approach).

Then the process invocation will fail in the same way current filter
process invocations fail. If "filter.<driver>.required" is set then
Git will fail, otherwise not.

Right, I'll add that! I implemented it in a way that the "filter.<driver>.clean" 
and "filter.<driver>.smudge" take presence over "filter.<driver>.process".

This allows the use of a `single-shot` clean filter and a `long-running` 
smudge as suggested by Junio in the v1 discussion (no ref, gmane down).

Thanks!

They would still hang. Would it be sufficient to mention that in the
docs?

Good suggestion! This is easy to handle and I think it mimics
the pack-protocol a bit more closely.

It sends a path absolute in context of the Git repo (e.g. subdir/testfile.dat).
I'll add that to the docs and I'll add a test case to demonstrate it.

OK

I think sending it upfront is nice for buffer allocations of big files
and it doesn't cost us anything to do it.

As I stated in my other response to you, I think there is value
in having a single protocol for streaming and non-streaming
content. I'll add a capability "stream" that doesn't require the 
"size upfront" answer from the filter.

Never by its own. The filter is always shutdown by Git. Something
for the docs, I guess :-)

Both terms are used in the document. Blob is also already used in a

The existing `single-shot` clean/smudge filter takes precedence
if they are available. The reason is that we would need to
start the `long-running` filter to figure out what capabilities
it has. On the upside I think that is the safest course of action
for existing Git installations out there.

I'll add test cases to demonstrate/ensure that behavior.

I think Git can invoke both filters on checkout.

I agree and I really appreciate that you sacrifice your time to think

This function reads pkt-lines until a flush packet into the strbuf.

I understand your concern but this what the original implementation
does, too, and therefore I would like to keep the behavior:

A little different. As I discussed with Peff elsewhere the existing write_packet
functions doesn't write the content of src directly. It creates a buffer which 
would cause unnecessary copy operations. However, as Junio noted, creating
these pkt-lines here is wrong. I will add an function to pkt-line.h that can create
a pkt-line without buffer.

packet_flush uses "write_or_die" internally. If the a non required filter fails
then this is no reason to die. However, using this pkt-line knowledge here is
wrong. I will add a new function to pkt-line.h. What do you think about
"tolerant_packet_flush" as function name?

Yes, but I realized that this becomes cumbersome with more "bools". I create a bitmap
and a few macros to check and set the bitmap (seems to be the Git way for these kind
of problems).

I could, but wouldn't that shadow the global variable? Wouldn't that be even

Correct. But filter_buffer_or_fd() requires some extra work on cmd

Maybe, but this wouldn't matter as we don't use this buffer afterwards.

Not sure. The beauty of pkt-line is that someone can just set GIT_TRACE_PACKET=1 to
see what is going on. I feel that this is enough and we don't need to have fine grained
error reporting...

Agreed. But this mimics the original apply_protocol() interface and therefore 
I would like to keep it.

You could also argue that fd is an alternative to src+len and belongs on a 
new line :-) In any way... if I would move fd up then we would exceed 80 chars...

I did this based on my understanding of Eric's feedback:

"Compilers complain about uninitialized variables.  Blindly
setting them to NULL can allow them to be dereferenced;
triggering segfaults; especially if it's passed to a different
compilation unit the compiler can't see."

See: http://public-inbox.org/git/20160725072745.GB11634%40starla/

Implementing the protocol in an async manner would be way harder
and is only necessary if you want to support true streaming (that
is reading and writing at the same time). This might be desired but
is out of scope for this patch series.

I solved it with a bitmask - no DeMorgan anymore :)

Right.

Yes. Pkt-line states "A non-binary line SHOULD BE terminated by an LF"
(see Documentation/technical/protocol-common.txt)

This is my solution that avoids an unnecessary buffer. As mentioned
above I move this code to its proper place in pkt-line.h/c.

OK, I will add an error(...).

True. I will add that to the docs.

I see where you are coming from. However, it tries to run the "clean" filter 
with the process and therefore I think the message is correct.

No. I will add the PERL requirement explicitly to the tests that need it.

With bracket style you mean the spaces? I used PerlTidy in

Maybe, but autoflush is not explicitly enabled. I will
enable it again (I disabled it because of Eric's comment
but I re-read the comment and he is only talking about
pipes).
