I have setup a repo on www.zenez.com.

I just did a git clone give://www.zenez.com/git git.

I am trying to get various communities to use git.  So I want all there 
changes to go to my master repo.  I am trying to get those that still 
support/work on SCO OS's to embrase the Open Source Software (OSS) 
concepts and give back to the OSS community inspite of the SCO Group and 
what they are doing.  I am a firm believer of OSS Concepts.  I still have 
to support many SCO Systems.  My clients applicatios only run on them.  
But I want as much as I can to promote the OSS Concepts and have them 
become a major part of the business I support.  

Because of all the anti SCO I want them to have a safe place to use and 
provide good services for them.  Saddly, I do this because of my own 
experience with retrobuction from fanatics.  I have had over 650 GB over 
written with "DIE SCO"  I was away for a week and when I came back I had 
had a break-in on one system and that was the result.  I have had DOS 
attacks and many others.  So I am trying to be a bridge between the to 
communities and other communites to promote the true spirt of Open Source.
