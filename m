I'm planning to pull the `new' branch of the gitk repository into the
master branch, making the new version of gitk the standard version
that will go into the git.git repository.  As far as I know the new
version does everything the old version does.  Does anyone know of any
problems with the new gitk that weren't in the old one?

Thanks,
Paul.
