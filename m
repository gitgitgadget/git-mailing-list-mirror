Well, a microoptimization at most: with all what's going on in
unpack_trees() I seriously doubt that it's effect is measurable.

No, it's indeed cached data, but now that you mention it, the subject
line does need a s/stat //.

The comparison is done with this call:

  ret = memcmp(&ce->ce_stat_data, &base->ce_stat_data,
               offsetof(struct cache_entry, name) -
               offsetof(struct cache_entry, ce_stat_data));

i.e. it starts at the stat data and ends just before the cache entry's
name, and 'struct cache_entry' has several other fields between these
two, including e.g. the cached oid:

  struct cache_entry {
          struct hashmap_entry ent;
          struct stat_data ce_stat_data;
          unsigned int ce_mode;
          unsigned int ce_flags;
          unsigned int mem_pool_allocated;
          unsigned int ce_namelen;
          unsigned int index;     /* for link extension */
          struct object_id oid;
          char name[FLEX_ARRAY]; /* more */
  };

However, to me it's mostly about clarity of the code, and about
documenting that CE_UPDATE_IN_BASE might have already been set at that
point and why, so the next dev diving in to debug the split index
doesn't have to figure this out himself.

Ah, I was secretly hoping for something along the lines of "your
analysis is correct, we can safely drop this comparison" :)

Btw, I thought about extracing this whole loop into a separate
function like mark_updated_entries_for_split_index() or something, but
there are other things going on in this loop as well, e.g. marking
with CE_MATCHED and deduplicating copied entries, not to mention the
conditions that set 'ce->index = 0', which I think should die() or
BUG() or are unnecessary, see my followup email to this patch in v4:
