Thank you, I'm glad that you like it. :)

In this case, I went with following the intersentence spacing used in
the surrounding text.  Though, my brain and muscle memory are kind of
hardcoded to use double spacing, which may not be as prevalent as a 
while
ago, but IMHO makes reading text rendered using a fixed-width font much
easier.  I can adjust if needed, of course.
