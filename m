It sounds like you are doing it right. And your emails look OK to me
(and the list is accepting them when cc'd). Your original mails may hav=

been greylisted, and waiting on your mail server to re-send them.
Depending on how your mail server is configured, that might be a few
minutes or a few hours. How long ago did you try?
