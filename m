Thank you for maintaining an open attitude and helping make the change
reasonable.

If inexperience refers to the user not being familiar with the patch
format, I don't think it's something we should worry about.  It is
very likely that few users will attempt to (e)dit, and those who do,
inexperienced users experimenting, the normal (and sensible) path they
will follow at the slightest difficulty will probably be to abandon
patch editing and try a more accessible option, such as: cancel the
`add -p` session, edit normally, and restart the session.

If inexperience refers to users unfamiliar with the (e)dit option but
knowledgeable about the patch format, I believe they will have enough
experience to know that reconstructing a patch is a tricky task.
Again, the most likely path they will follow when encountering
difficulties will be to restart the edit (Junio's message in the
thread is an example of this).

At any rate, although I understand the concern, this series doesn't
aim to improve the mechanisms that help identify the problems in a
faulty patch.  The goal of this series is to offer (actually to
recover) the possibility for the user to make corrections.

Something I haven't mentioned before in this thread is that currently,
if the user makes a mistake while editing a patch, we don't give them
the opportunity to review their error.  We leave them in doubt.  This
happened recently to me editing a patch with context lines containing
whitespace errors and "whitespace=fix".  But that's another story that
I still need to work on [1].

So, to me, it seems sensible to let the user review the faulty patch,
even if it's only to discard it.

It has been so for a decade...

Keep in mind that this message will probably only be shown very _very_
rarely to users who are most likely very familiar with (e)dit.

That's an option I explored but abandoned.

I didn't come up with any message that I liked that wasn't literally a
long paragraph.

In the end, I gave up in favor of what I believe is a better option,
which is recovering the original intention of "no".

I'm not against the option you propose, I'm just not convinced that
what we already have, since ac083c47ea (git-add--interactive: manual
hunk editing mode, 2008-07-03), isn't intuitive enough for the
users of (e)dit.

For me, this isn't a reason not to make the change.

I don't see that external process. Â¿?

After reviewing the code in the previous iteration, based on your
comments, I concluded that `recolor_hunk()` makes more sense before
the "return 0".  Even if we end up discarding this series.  I think.

As I said above, I don't object to this, but I'm not convinced it's
necessary.

I've been resisting the idea of "completeness", because I think "e y"
should also be fine.  But I'm not going to resist anymore here :-),
since I don't think the test has much more value without "n q".  So
I'll add it.
