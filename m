I'm not sure that this would work, or at least that it creates another
pair of cases that we have to disambiguate. Here's what I'm thinking
after reading what you wrote:

  - By this point in the series, we expect every commit in a
    commit-graph layer to have a corresponding entry in the 'BIDX' chunk
    (if one exists, obviously all of this is meaningless without
    specifying '--changed-paths').

  - In a future commit (specifically, "builtin/commit-graph.c: introduce
    '--max-new-filters=<n>'"), this will no longer be the case.

  - So, by that point in the series, we would have two possible reasons
    why a commit did not show up in the BIDX. Either:

      * The commit has too many changed paths, in which case we don't
        want to write it down, or

      * We had already computed too many new filters, and so didn't have
        the budget to compute the filter for some commit(s).

In the first of those two cases, we want to avoid recomputing the
too-large filter. But, in the latter case, we *do* want to compute the
filter from scratch, since we want to "backfill" commits with missing
filters by letting them trickle in over time.

I might be missing something, too, but I think that those two cases are
just as indistinguishable as what's in the commit-graph today (without
the 'BFXL' chunk).

It doesn't, but it's also not meant to. The idea is that if the value
ever were easy to customize, then we could keep track of which layers
were written with which threshold. This would allow you to invent fancy
rules like dropping filters when the threshold lowers, or recomputing
ones that you wouldn't have otherwise when it goes up.

Fair point.

I don't think that this is true. Omitting the chunk (because you have
computed--or tried to compute--filters for every commit in the graph)
isn't distinguishable from what exists today, so we are back at square
one there.

I agree it's unpleasant, but I also don't think it's a show-stopper.

I think this is a semantic difference: either you store a bitmap, or a
Bloom filter containing the same data. To me, I don't think there's a
huge difference, since we're talking about 1 bit per commit. If we were
really worried, we could store them as EWAH-compressed bitmaps, but I
don't get a sense that such a concern exists.

I do feel strongly about using a non-probabilistic data structure,
though, since the point of this feature is to be able to make tighter
guarentees about the runtime of 'git commit-graph write'.

I don't think it needs to be the same necessarily.

Addressed both, thanks.
