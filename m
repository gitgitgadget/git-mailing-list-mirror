Not really. If you feel there's a need for a blog, just start one and
then maintain it. Problem sorted, and 3000 people needn't bother to
even think about it ;-)

If you want a 100% official git blog, then that'll be up to Junio to
do and I'm sure he will if he wants to and think there's a need for
it. Personally I think it's useful to get feedback on what people
want the actual software to do, and much less useful to get feedback
on how the community should be managed. Mostly since the community
will manage itself so long as there's interest in it, and it will do
so better without input from people who aren't actually in it. It's
for that precise reason noone should be allowed to make rules they
don't have to obey themselves.

Considering the successes of the wars on alcohol, poverty, drugs and
terror, I think we should give some serious thought to declaring war
on peace.
