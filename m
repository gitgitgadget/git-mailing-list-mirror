My big question is what happens on other platforms when they see a NULL
(but 0-sized) buffer. Any reasonable implementation would just return
ERANGE and we'd fall back to the existing code. But we often have to deal with unreasonable ones.

So do we need a "my OS understands getcwd(NULL)" build knob?
