Interesting find.

The "too old" curl is older than 7.19.4, which we actually fail to build
with since v2.12.0. So they probably did not even get as far as the
tests. ;)

OK. Once upon a time I think we had trouble with "grep -E", since some
older systems had only "egrep". But I see we've introduced some "grep
-E" invocations as far back as 2013 and nobody has complained, so it's
probably fine.
