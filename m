I tested these patches with the Linux kernel repo and reported my results
on each patch. However, I wanted to also test on a larger internal repo
(the AzureDevOps repo), which has ~500 commits with more than 512 changes,
and generally has larger diffs than the Linux kernel repo.

| Version  | Time   | Memory |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Garima   | 16m36s | 27.0gb |
| Peff 1   | 6m32s  | 28.0gb |
| Peff 2   | 6m48s  |  5.6gb |
| Peff 3   | 6m14s  |  4.5gb |
| Shortcut | 3m47s  |  4.5gb |

For reference, I found the time and memory information using
"/usr/bin/time --verbose" in a bash script.

By "Shortcut" in the table above, I mean the following patch on top of
Garima's and Peff's changes. It inserts a max_changes option into struct
diff_options to halt the diff early. This seemed like an easier change
than creating a new tree diff algorithm wholesale.

Subject: [PATCH] diff: halt tree-diff early after max_changes

When computing the changed-paths bloom filters for the commit-graph,
we limit the size of the filter by restricting the number of paths
in the diff. Instead of computing a large diff and then ignoring the
result, it is better to halt the diff computation early.

Create a new "max_changes" option in struct diff_options. If non-zero,
then halt the diff computation after discovering strictly more changed
paths. This includes paths corresponding to trees that change.

Use this max_changes option in the bloom filter calculations. This
reduces the time taken to compute the filters for the Linux kernel
repo from 2m50s to 2m35s. For a larger repo with more commits changing
many paths, the time reduces from 6 minutes to under 4 minutes.
