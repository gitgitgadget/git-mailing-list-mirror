I suspect this ought to eventually be converted to return an error, to
match the rest of the refs code. And in that sense, this is a step
backwards versus leaving the current die_errno in place and dropping the
LOCK_DIE_ON_ERROR flag. But it probably doesn't matter much either way,
and whoever does the conversion later can deal with it.
