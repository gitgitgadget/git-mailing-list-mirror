This part is a little counter-intuitive to me. Is anybody ever going to
pass in anything except a struct initialized to REPOSITORY_FORMAT_INIT?

If so, might it be kinder for read_...() to not assume anything about
the incoming struct, and initialize it from scratch? I.e., not to use
clear() but just do the initialization step?

A caller which calls read_() multiple times would presumably have an
intervening clear (either their own, or the one done on an error return
from the read function).

Other than that minor nit, I like the overall shape of this.

One interesting tidbit:

This uses designated initializers, which is a C99-ism, but one we've
used previously and feel confident in. But...

...this uses that expression not as an initializer, but as a compound
literal. That's also C99, but AFAIK it's the first usage in our code
base. I don't know if it will cause problems or not.

The "old" way to do it is:

  struct repository_format foo = REPOSITORY_FORMAT_INIT;
  memcpy(format, &foo, sizeof(foo));

Given how simple it is to fix if it turns out to be a problem, I'm OK
including it as a weather balloon.
