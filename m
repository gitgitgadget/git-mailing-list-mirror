Right, this is important. credential_fill() may actually prompt the
user, and we'd want to then pass along that credential for storage. Or
the user may have changed their password, and the credential_reject() is
the only thing that prevents us from trying an out-dated password over
and over.

That would work. I'm also tempted to say that imap_server_conf could
just store the "struct credential" inside it. We could even potentially
drop its parallel user/pass fields to minimize confusion.

Once upon a time imap-send was a fork of another program, which is why
most of its code isn't well-integrated with Git. But I think at this
point there's very little chance of merging changes back and forth
between the two.

On the other hand, if we're hoping to get rid of this code in favor of
the curl-based approach, then it's not worth spending time on
cosmetic refactoring, as long as it still behaves correctly in the
interim.
