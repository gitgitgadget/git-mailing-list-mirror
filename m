Hi!

Some general translation comments (I don't particularly know about Span=
ish).

Alejandro Riveira Fern=C3=A1ndez:

> I'm open to sugestions. the same problem with "commit" (either verb o=
r
> noun) tracking branch, push ( propagar is ok? ) etc...

=46or my translation, I used the translated versions of "check-in" (as =
in to=20
check-in to a flight) for "commit", for "branch" I used the same word a=
s for=20
a branch on a tree, and for "push", I translated as "send". If you can'=
t=20
find a direct translation, finding a simpler synonym in English is usua=
lly a=20
good way to go.

Also do check if there are translated GUIs for other version control=20
software, and try to be consistent with them.

If there is doubt, it is usually better to spell it out, possibly keepi=
ng=20
the original abbreviation (such as writing "EOF (end of file)", with "e=
nd of=20
file" translated).

--=20
