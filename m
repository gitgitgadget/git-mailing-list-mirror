You argued elsewhere in this thread:

I buy this argument, in particular, since not even I read the plain text
files, but use the rendered version.

I would like tone down my harsh opposition to mild opposition. IMO, it
should still be easy to *write* the documentation. It should not be
necessary that authors remember to use macros all over the place.

And I still think that we should not introduce macros just to please all
renderers. Let's just pick the one renderer that can do the job best. If
it means that some distribution cannot render the documentation
perfectly themselves (Debian? I don't know), they can always use the
pre-rendered version that Junio kindly produces.
