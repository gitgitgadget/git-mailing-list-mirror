Yeah, sorry, I should have made more clear that this is fine. I always
try to read parsing code with my paranoid hat on, but I agree that
grafts aren't really exposed to untrusted entities.

In general I'd prefer to avoid artificial limits unless there's a need
for them. There are already spots (like receive-pack) where you can ask
Git to store bytes in RAM as fast as you can send them. What I found
interesting about this one was the 20:1 amplification. :)

It might even be worth listing them in the commit message. Somebody
finding your commit 3 years from via "git log -S" or "git blame" might
say "yes, but why didn't they just do it like...". You can respond to
them preemptively. :)
