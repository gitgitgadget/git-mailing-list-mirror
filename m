This can be mitigated by using, for example,

  git grep -e --stdin --and -e mutually

as long as the rewrite keeps the arguments on the same line with the
format strings, which it does.

Another aspect is that translators lose context. For example, "%s and %s
are mutally exclusive" may have to be translated differently depending
on what kind of text is substituted for %s. In this example it's
probably always command line options (I haven't checked), so not an
immediate problem. But something to keep in mind.
