Yes, that would be fine.

The problem with the current behavior is that the warnings accumulate
for every commit that affects the particular file. So, after import,
the head commit will have a commit message ending in:

	SKIPPED: broken-file
	SKIPPED: broken-file
	SKIPPED: broken-file
	...

With one line per affected commit. So an alternate patch that simply
kept the warning unique per file would be fine too.

The discussion may be entirely moot since I don't know when it is
reasonable for a file to be missing in this way. In my specific case I
think the missing ,v file happened due to a combination of factors,
including old data in ~/.cvsps, and that data being stale due to some
manual surgery on the ,v files, (copying or renaming or so).

It would probably be fine to leave the current behavior until someone
runs into this again.
