I agree that changing a subject (with "(was: <oldsubject>)") is nicer to
find specific mails later.

"Everyone should" bla usually does not work in open communities.

And why not vice versa?
A new "What's cooking in " mail with new cookings could start a new
thread instead of replying to old "What's cooking in" mails...

Hm, I don't really care.

Mutt is able to link and break threads with

	#       break-thread         break the thread in two
	&        link-threads         link tagged message to the current one

so I am able to design the threads as I like it ;)
(And I am also able to change subjects as I like, so I don't have a
problem.)

Regards,
  Stephan
