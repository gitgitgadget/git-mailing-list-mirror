I don't know either, but funny things often cause trouble. send-email
would have to parse the patch to avoid adding its own headers. The
easiest solution/workaround is that the user should know, whether he
does the threading with format-patch or send-email. This is error, of
course.

See also this recent thread about the same:

This is caused by a bug fixed in commit 5e9758e29 (send-email: fix
non-threaded mails, 2009-06-12). Try using "git send-email --no-thread
--no-chain-reply" and it may work again. You should use an up-to-date
git, when searching for bugs.
