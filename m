I'm not all that familiar with the innards of git-send-email.perl
either. Looking closer, I see $subject is indeed declared outside of the
regular loop, so it would need to be reset (just like $message_id is). I
guess nobody noticed because patches almost always have their own
"Subject:" header, which would override it.

But either that should go into its own patch, or the commit message
should be modified to explain that it is covering not just
in-reply-to/references, but we think this fixes all similar variables.

You'd want something like the patch below (and possibly something
similar for the $subject handling).

Both of the new tests fail without your patch and pass with it, but:

  - note the weird behavior I found with --in-reply-to; this is
    something we might want to address at the same time

  - applying your patch fails the earlier t9001.52 ("In-Reply-To without
    --chain-reply-to"). I didn't dig into what's going on there.
