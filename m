+NAME
+----
+gittutorial - Introduction to Git for beginners
+
+DESCRIPTION
+-----------
+
+This tutorial explains how to import a project's code into Git, make
+changes to it, and upload the project to the Internet.
+
+We'll show you how to use the commands `git commit`, `git add`,
+`git diff`, `git status`, and `git push`.
+
+Command line vs GUI
+-------------------
+
+Git is a command line program, but there are many excellent GUIs for
+Git built by the community. For example, if you use an IDE to edit your
+code, it might already have a built-in Git integration that you can use.
+
+In this tutorial, we'll give instructions for the command line version
+of Git, but you can also follow along in a GUI. You can also do some
+tasks in a GUI and some tasks on the command line. It's up to you.
+
+What we'll be doing
+-------------------
+
+Git lets you take snapshots of your code, like a checkpoint in a video
+game. In this tutorial we're going to explain a very basic Git
+workflow, which is:
+
+1. Create an empty folder
+2. Start using Git to manage the code in that folder
+3. Create 2 files and tell Git to save a snapshot of them
+4. Make changes to one of the files
+5. Tell Git to take another snapshot
+6. Repeat steps 4-5 any time you want to update your code
+
+We'll also explain how to use Git to put your code on the Internet.
+
+Step 1: Make sure Git is installed
+----------------------------------
+
+To do this tutorial, you'll need:
+
+1. Git to be installed. You might already have it installed,
+   and if not there are directions at https://git-scm.com/install/
+2. A folder on your computer with code that you want to start managing
+   with Git.
+
+You can check if Git is installed by running this in your terminal:
+
+------------------------------------------------
+$ git --version
+------------------------------------------------
+
+[[step_2]]
+Step 2: Introduce yourself to Git
+---------------------------------
+
+The first time you use Git on a computer, it's a good idea to tell Git
+your name and public email address. If you don't, you'll get a lot of
+warnings from Git. To do this, run:
+
+------------------------------------------------
+$ git config --global user.name "Namey McName"
+$ git config --global user.email you@example.com
+------------------------------------------------
+
+The name and email is so that other people you're collaborating with can
+know who made the changes. You can set them to anything you want.
+
+To check if the name and email have been set, you can run these
+commands:
+
+------------------------------------------------
+$ git config user.name
+$ git config user.email
+------------------------------------------------
+
+Set your default branch name to `main`, by running this command.
+Git is going to change its default branch name to `main` soon, so this
+sets you up well for the future.
+
+------------------------------------------------
+$ git config --global init.defaultBranch main
+------------------------------------------------
+
+If there's no output, then it succeeded.
+
+Step 3: Create an empty folder and 2 files
+------------------------------------------
+
+In your terminal, create an empty folder and change directories into it.
+Later on you could follow the same steps in this tutorial to take an
+existing project and start managing it with Git, but we're going to use
+an empty project so that everyone following this tutorial has the exact
+same files.
+
+For example, run these commands to make a folder called `myproject`
+
+------------------------------------------------
+$ mkdir myproject
+$ cd myproject
+------------------------------------------------
+
+Create 2 files in this directory, so we have something to work with.
+
+Make a file called README.md, with these contents:
+
+------------------------------------------------
+We're doing a Git tutorial!
+We need 2 lines in this file so here's a second one
+------------------------------------------------
+
+And a file called `hello.py`, with these contents:
+
+------------------------------------------------
+print("hello world")
+------------------------------------------------
+
+Save the two files and keep them open in your text editor so you can
+easily edit them later. The exact contents aren't too important, but
+we'll use those contents in the example output later.
+
+You can check that the files are in the right place by running `ls`,
+like this:
+
+
+------------------------------------------------
+$ ls
+------------------------------------------------
+
+The output should be like this:
+
+------------------------------------------------
+hello.py
+README.md
+------------------------------------------------
+
+Step 4: Create a Git repository
+-------------------------------
+
+A Git repository is a folder which stores snapshots. It's usually a
+hidden folder called `.git`. Every time you take a snapshot, Git stores
+a copy of the contents of every file you're tracking.
+
+This might feel unbelievable, but Git uses compression so you can easily
+store tens of thousands of snapshots without using too much disk space.
+
+You can create a Git repository for any folder in your computer by
+running the command `git init`.
+
+Run `git init` in the folder you just created, like this:
+
+------------------------------------------------
+$ git init
+------------------------------------------------
+
+Git will reply:
+
+------------------------------------------------
+Initialized empty Git repository in .git/
+------------------------------------------------
+
+You might notice a new hidden folder was created, named `.git`.
+
+Step 5: Take your first snapshot
+--------------------------------
+
+Next, we're going to take a snapshot of all the files in the directory
+and tell Git to store them. Taking a snapshot in Git is a two step
+process: first you need to run `git add` and then `git commit`.
+
+The reason it's a two step process is that sometimes you might not
+actually want Git to store a snapshot of _all_ the files in a folder.
+For example, if you have a file full of private personal information
+called `personal.csv`, and a Python script called `process_data.py`, you
+might want Git to keep a snapshot of the Python script but not the
+private data.
+
+For now, we're going to store a snapshot of every file in your folder,
+as well as in every subfolder.
+
+The first step of creating a snapshot is to tell Git which files you
+want to include in the next snapshot using `git add`. To tell Git
+"include all files", run this command:
+
+------------------------------------------------
+$ git add .
+------------------------------------------------
+
+Next you can create the snapshot using the `git commit` command, like
+this. The `-m` flag stands for "message", and it lets you set a reminder
+for your future self of what you were doing. The message ("Initial
+commit" in this example) can say anything you want.
+
+------------------------------------------------
+$ git commit -m "Initial commit"
+------------------------------------------------
+
+You've now stored the first version of your project in Git! From now on
+we're going to use the word "commit" instead of "snapshot", since that's
+the term Git uses.
+
+Step 6: Make a change
+---------------------
+
+Now, let's learn how to make a change to a file and review the change you made.
+In this example, we'll update the file `README.md`, but you can edit a
+different file.
+
+First open `README.md` in your favourite text editor, make a tiny or
+silly change, and save it.
+
+Next, in the terminal, run the command `git status` to get a summary of
+what you changed since the last Git commit.
+
+------------------------------------------------
+$ git status
+------------------------------------------------
+
+The output will look something like this:
+
+------------------------------------------------
+On branch main
+
+Changes not staged for commit:
+  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
+  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
+        modified:   README.md
+------------------------------------------------
+
+This output says that we've changed `README.md` since the last time
+we committed.
+
+Next, if you want to see the details of how you've changed `README.md`,
+you can run `git diff`.
+
+------------------------------------------------
+$ git diff
+------------------------------------------------
+
+The output will look something like this:
+
+------------------------------------------------
+diff --git a/README.md b/README.md
+index 7ebaecb3..5a4ff712 100644
+--- a/README.md
++++ b/README.md
+@@ -1,2 +1,2 @@
+ Here are some Python scripts!
++I hope you like them.
+------------------------------------------------
+
+This output says that we added one line, saying "I hope you like them.".
+By default Git will show the lines you removed in red, and the lines you
+added in green.
+
+Step 7: Make another commit (easy way)
+--------------------------------------
+
+Now let's tell Git to save the new version of `README.md` by making
+another commit! To tell Git to snapshot all files that Git is tracking
+and commit them, run this command:
+
+------------------------------------------------
+$ git commit -am "Update README"
+------------------------------------------------
+
+This is similar to the two step process in Step 4 where we used `git
+add` and `git commit` to make a commit, but with a shortcut that lets
+you do both in just one command. The `-a` stands for "all".
+
+Step 7b: Make another commit (longer way)
+-----------------------------------------
+
+`git commit -am` is a fast way to snapshot all the files that Git is
+tracking. But if you want Git to ignore changes to certain files, you
+can instead do a 2-step process like in Step 4 where first you run `git
+add` for every file that's been changed and that you want to include in
+the next commit, like this:
+
+------------------------------------------------
+$ git add README.md
+------------------------------------------------
+
+and then run `git commit` (without the `-a`), like this:
+
+------------------------------------------------
+$ git commit -m "Update README"
+------------------------------------------------
+
+Step 8: Make a change and throw it away
+---------------------------------------
+
+One of the most useful things about Git is that it lets you safely
+experiment: you never need to be scared to change your code because you
+can always go back to the old version.
+
+Before starting to experiment, run `git status` to check the current
+state of your Git repository:
+
+------------------------------------------------
+$ git status
+On branch main
+
+nothing to commit, working tree clean
+------------------------------------------------
+
+This "working tree clean" message means that there haven't been any
+changes since your last commit.
+
+Now make a change to your code, and run `git status` again. Like last
+time, you should see a message like this:
+
+------------------------------------------------
+$ git status
+On branch main
+
+Changes not staged for commit:
+  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
+  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
+        modified:   README.md
+------------------------------------------------
+
+This tells us that `README.md` has been changed since the last commit.
+But we don't actually want this change, so let's undo it! We can restore
+`README.md` back to how it was at the most recent commit using the `git
+restore` command.
+
+**WARNING**: `git restore` can't be reversed! Any time you run it it's
+important to be absolutely sure that you're okay with throwing away your
+changes since the last commit.
+
+------------------------------------------------
+$ git restore README.md
+------------------------------------------------
+
+Now open `README.md` again. You should see that your changes have been undone.
+
+You can stop here!
+------------------
+
+The commands we've learned so far (`git init`, `git add`, `git commit`,
+`git diff`, `git status`, and `git restore`) are enough to get a lot out
+of Git on their own.
+
+With these commands, you can keep copies of past versions of your code
+on your computer and safely experiment with big changes to your code.
+
+When using Git this way, all of your code just lives on your computer.
+But if you want to put your code on the Internet so that other people
+can use it or back it up, then you'll need to learn about one more
+command: `git push`.
+
+The rest of this tutorial is about how to upload your code to a Git
+repository on the Internet. The high level process is:
+
+1. Create an account on the Git host
+2. Configure Git so that it can login to the Git host to make changes
+3. Run `git push origin main` to upload your code
+
+Navigating the Git host's UI can be tricky, and it's hard for us to
+give you exact directions because the UIs change a lot.
+
+Step 9: Create an account on a Git host
+---------------------------------------
+
+To put your code on the Internet, you need it to be hosted somewhere.
+The easiest way to do this is to sign up with a Git host. There's a list
+of Git hosts (many of them offer free accounts) at
+https://git-scm.com/tools/hosting. GitHub and GitLab are two popular hosts.
+
+If you're comfortable running a server, there are other ways to host
+a Git repository on the internet, like connecting through SSH or open
+source Git forge software to your server.
+
+Step 10: Create an SSH key (if needed)
+-------------------------------------
+
+For Git to upload changes to another Git repository, it needs a way to
+login to that repository. One of the most popular ways to do this is
+with an SSH key.
+
+If you don't already have an SSH key, you'll need to create one. On Mac
+or Linux, you can check if you already have an SSH key by running:
+
+-------------------------------------------
+$ ls ~/.ssh/*.pub
+-------------------------------------------
+
+If you don't already have an SSH key, run:
+
+-------------------------------------------
+$ ssh-keygen
+-------------------------------------------
+
+`ssh-keygen` will ask you for some details.
+The easiest way to do this is to just press Enter at every prompt until
+it's done.
+
+NOTE: All of the advice about how to use SSH in this tutorial is aimed
+at getting it to work as quickly as possible. Setting up SSH in a secure
+way is very far outside the scope of this tutorial. If you have a
+security team in your organization, they might have very different
+opinions about the appropriate way to configure authentication with Git.
+
+Step 11: Tell the Git host your SSH public key
+----------------------------------------------
+
+First, find your SSH key like this (on Mac or Linux):
+
+-------------------------------------------
+$ ls ~/.ssh/*.pub
+-------------------------------------------
+
+That will output something like
+
+-------------------------------------------
+/home/alice/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
+-------------------------------------------
+
+Copy the contents of that file to your clipboard. It's important that
+the filename ends in `.pub` ("pub" stands for "public").
+
+Then login to your account on the Git host you chose and paste the SSH
+key into the appropriate place. Depending on the Git host, it's likely
+under "SSH keys" in your settings. If it asks you what type of SSH key,
+look for something like "Authentication Key".
+
+Once you've done this, you're done! Git will automatically use your SSH
+key to try to connect.
+
+Step 12: Create an empty Git repository on the Git host
+-------------------------------------------------------
+
+Go to the Git host's website and create a new Git repository.
+
+**WARNING**: If you create a public repository and push your repository
+to it, then your name and email address, as well as the contents of
+any files you committed and every previous version of those files, will
+be on the public internet. Some Git hosts have the option to create
+a private repository instead, to keep your information private.
+
+Step 13: Find the address of the repository
+-------------------------------------------
+
+Now, find the address of the repository on your Git host. It should look
+something like this:
+
+-------------------------------------------
+git@git.example.com:username/repo.git
+-------------------------------------------
+
+(where `example.com`, `username` and `repo` will be replaced with the
+actual values).
+
+If you can only find an address starting with `https://`, then
+you can often translate it to the SSH format by replacing `https://`
+with `git@` and replacing the `/` after the domain name with an `:`.
+Here's how:
+
+-------------------------------------------
+https://git.example.com/username/repo
+^^^^^^^^               ^
+replace with "git@"    replace with ":"
+-------------------------------------------
+
+Step 14: push your changes
+--------------------------
+
+Finally, we're ready to send the information in your local Git repository
+to the one on the internet!
+
+First, tell Git about the other repository by running `git remote add`
+in your terminal
+(replace `git@example.com:username/repo.git` with the actual address):
+
+-------------------------------------------
+$ git remote add origin git@example.com:username/repo.git
+-------------------------------------------
+
+This tells Git to save the URL `git@example.com:username/repo.git` in
+your Git repository's configuration under the name `origin`, so that you
+can use it later. If you make a mistake while doing this, you can run
+`git remote remove origin` and try again.
+
+Then tell Git to send the information, with `git push`
+(if this doesn't work, read the "Troubleshooting `git push`" section for advice!):
+
+-------------------------------------------
+$ git push -u origin main
+-------------------------------------------
+
+`origin` refers to the URL we just added (`git@example.com:username/repo.git`),
+and `main` is the name of your current Git branch. You can use any name
+(not just `origin`), but using `origin` often makes things easier
+because it's the default for `git push` and `git pull`.
+We haven't covered branches yet, but `main` is the default branch name.
+
+Any time you want to set up a new repository, you can repeat steps
+11-13, with one exception: you only need to pass `-u` the first time
+you push. Afterwards you can just run the command:
+
+-------------------------------------------
+$ git push origin main
+-------------------------------------------
+
+It should output something like this:
+
+-------------------------------------------
+To example.com:example_username/example
+ * [new branch]        main -> main
+-------------------------------------------
+
+Troubleshooting `git push`
+--------------------------
+
+There are 3 main errors you might run into when running `git push origin main`.
+Getting errors when running `git push` is actually a big part of using
+Git, so congratulations! If you get to this part of the tutorial, you
+get a little bonus experience in debugging.
+
+Here's a guide to why they're happening and how to fix them.
+
+**Problem 1**: You pushed to `main`, but your branch actually isn't called `main`
+
+Here's the error:
+```
+$ git push origin main
+error: src refspec main does not match any
+```
+
+This might happen if you didn't set `init.defaultBranch` to `main` in
+<<step_2,Step 2>>.
+
+If you want to check the name of your current branch, you can run `git
+status`. For example, in this output, the current branch is "master".
+
+-------------------------------------------
+$ git status
+On branch master
+
+...
+-------------------------------------------
+
+To push your branch, you have a few options:
+
+* rename your branch to `main`, by running `git branch -m main`
+  and then run `git push origin main`
+* run `git push origin master`
+  (where `master` is the name of your actual current branch)
+
+**Problem 2: SSH error**
+
+Here's the error:
+
+-----
+$ git push origin main
+The authenticity of host 'github.com (140.82.116.3)' can't be established.
+ED25519 key fingerprint is: SHA256:+DiY3wvvV6TuJJhbpZisF/zLDA0zPMSvHdkr4UvCOqU
+This key is not known by any other names.
+Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
+-----
+
+Git uses SSH to connect during `git push`, and this message happens when
+SSH connects to a new site that you haven't connected to before.
+
+The easiest way to handle this is to type "yes" and press Enter.
+
+**Problem 3: the repository already exists**
+
+Here's the error:
+
+---------------------
+$ git push origin main
+! [rejected]        main -> main (fetch first)
+error: failed to push some refs to 'example.com:example/example.git'
+hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not
+hint: have locally.
+---------------------
+
+If you see an error like this, it means that when you created the
+repository on your Git host, it created a repository with a file in it
+to try to help you out. (that's the "work that you do not have locally"
+in the error message)
+
+You can fix this either by deleting the repository and recreating it, or
+by running:
+
+---------------------
+$ git push --force origin main
+---------------------
+
+**WARNING**: In general it's quite dangerous to use `--force` because
+it can erase work on the online repository in a way that's difficult to
+recover. But if you know for sure that you just created the repository 2
+minutes ago and there's nothing in it, then it's okay.
+
+MORE USEFUL GIT COMMANDS
+------------------------
+
+* To tell Git to "un-add" a file that you added by accident, run
+  `git rm --cached FILENAME`
