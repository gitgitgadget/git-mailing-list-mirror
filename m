My assumption was that nobody would really care about doing so. It is
true that it's less flexible, though (and is a decision we can't easily
take back later).

Ick. The extra quoting of the internal double-quotes is pretty horrid to
look at. Also, how does one match a double-quote in the value? \\\"?

If it were optional, that would make the common cases easy (no dq, no
whitespace), and the hard ones possible.

I think this is getting into a bit of a digression, though. I'm willing
to defer to Ã†var, who is doing the actual work, and I don't know if he
has found any of this compelling. ;)

I think it's just the mashed-up colons that I find ugly in the first
one. But I agree the latter isn't that nice either, and introduces the
ambiguity you describe.

That I think is the most interesting question: is the "=" actually
out-of-bounds? I tend to think not, based on our responses earlier in
the thread.
