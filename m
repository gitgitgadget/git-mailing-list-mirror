Hello list,

I have a central server where git repos are located and based on http base push/pull.
authentication is done by a text based password file, generated by htpasswd.

I am searching for a server side hook (pre-push) which can prevent all push to master,
except few users found at that password file generated by htpasswd. Is there any such hook
available ? Some suggest to use gitolite, but it also based on the hooks to do the same.

Thanks
