Hmm. It seems like the problem is that "-p" is saying "the other side
does not have refs/heads/test; we must prune it". But I think it is
probably nonsense to apply pruning to a non-wildcard refspec.

There is a separate issue of whether it is sane to apply fetch.prune to
a refspec given on the command line; I can imagine it as surprising, to
say the least.

I think "--no-prune" would disable it, though.
