Why so combative, Johannes? I merely answered one of Jonathan's =20
questions. Nobody has proffered any "excuses".

And in any case, you're exaggerating. Jonathan said that he's already =20
invested time in trying to get it working, most certainly more time =20
than it has taken he, you or I, to write the emails in this thread, =20
and he's gotten as far as his Perl knowledge permits him.

Cheers,
