I _think_ you can either:

 - decide to pay the mentor (and have the mentor just pay the tax on it 
   as extra income). Mentors can then sort it out amongst themselves.

 - If nobody really wants to go through the hassle (not so much in 
   receiving the money, as trying to sort it out ;), decide to just 
   directly transfer it to some charitable organization that is already 
   set up (eg the EFF).

as it would probably be more pain than it's worth to actually try to set 
up some "git foundation".

Regardless, congrats on the GSoC entry!
