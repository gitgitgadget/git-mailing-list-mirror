Very nice, although earlier version had the advantage of having everything
on one page. I hope that no information was lost.

What it lacks is the link in menu bar to Home (or News), 
i.e. http://git.or.cz/ or http://git.or.cz/index.html page.

About Download page (http://git.or.cz/download.html) - it would be nice to
have in comments about firewalls told which port git uses for git://
protocol.
