Nah. Worse. Assume a perl script that is simply 'die "hello world"'. If it's in a file, perl reports 255. If from stdin, perl reports 162/169. Doh. That's supposed to be 128+signum, and max sig is 31 (SIGABEND) on the platform. The difficulty at this point is that if I fix wait_or_whine to map either code to 255 or 1, then many more other tests fail, so I'm stuck with either 6 reasonably acceptable breaks or about 60 unacceptable ones, based on assumptions in test_must_fail or other fail detections in the git suite. I'd rather not mess with git code if the test breaks themselves are explainable.

Sign.
