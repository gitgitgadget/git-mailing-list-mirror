Let's then us review what started this thread, namely comparison chart
between source control systems
  http://bazaar-vcs.org/RcsComparisons

1. Decentralized. O.K.

2. Disconnected Ops. O.K.

3. Simple Namespace. Should be named "Simple Rev Names" instead, Bazaar
should have note that revnos work only for specific workflows
(star-topology); for Git it should be perhaps "Somewhat" here, as <ref>~<n>
(or <ref>@{<n>} if reflog is enabled) _are_ simple (if volatile for branch
<refs>). $(git-merge-base <ref1> <ref2>), usually "hidden" in
<ref1>..<ref2> or <ref1>...<ref2> shortcut is also I think simple. There
was huge discussion here about revnos, revids, workflows (development
topology), fast-forwards, empty merges etc. Bazaar-NG and Git puts
emphasisis on other things. Additionally tags supports removes some of
perceived revnos advantages; tags are simple.

4. Supports Renames. I could agree with "Somewhat" because of not yet
implemented --follow option to git-rev-list (and therefore all porcelain).
Perhaps it would be closer to truth to leave the marker (background color)
as for "Somewhat" and write "N/A" with note that Git has contents and
pathname based heuristic detection of renames, or just put "Detect" or
"Detection" here.

I would certainly change description of what means that SCM doesn't "Support
Renames" or has it implemented partially. Current explanation relies
heavily on _implementation_. The correct wording of current definition
would be that SCM doesn't support renames if history of a file "as visible
to SCM" is broken into before rename and after rename part, and that SCM
support it partially if you can track history of renamed file from
post-rename name but there is left in void history of pre-rename file.
But with this definition Git _does_ "Supports Renames".

I'd rather split "Supports Renames" into engine part (does SCM
remember/detect that rename took place _as_ rename, not remember/detect it
as copiying+deletion; something other than rename) and user interface part:
can user easily deal with renames (this includes merging and viewing file
history).

5 and 6. Needs Repository/Supports Repository. The name is very, very
unclean and stems from branch-centricness of Bazaar. Git should probably
have "Yes" here, as for Git branch is just reference to its tip in
revisions DAG (plus optionally branch tip history in reflog). On the other
hand Git _can_ share object database like branches can be gathered together
to share data into repository. You can have one-branch repositories, you
can clone whole repositories (perhaps Bazaar should have "Somewhat" for
Supports Repository as it doesn't support cloning of whole repository...
bzt, wrong, there is example plugin for that), and you can clone (using
Cogito) only one branch of repository and you can fetch only selected
branches of repository.

Thinking more about it those items should probably read "Support Individual
Branches" (as: can you get only the branch you are interested in, can SCM
support one-branch workflow) and "Support Branch Grouping" or "Support Data
Sharing" (as: can you share DAG between branches, can you share DAG between
repositories).

7. Checkouts (as a noun). This probably read "Support Centralized and
Disconnected Centralized Workflow" but that is perhaps too wordy. Git would
have "No" for "Centralized" and "Somewhat" for "Disconnected Centralized"
meaning that you can set up Git repository to be equivalent of heavyweight
checkout, and push changes to some given repository on commit.

8. Partial Checkouts (as a verb). Here Git should have perhaps "Minimal", as
you can have partial checkouts but only with care (and you still need whole
repository). "No?" is also correct (?).

9. Atomic Commits. O.K. You have to remember that there are consequences
of having Atomic Commits on the details of Partial Checkouts.

10. Cheap Branching Anywhere. Git should probably have "Yes! Yes! Yes!"
here ;-)

11. Smart Merge. O.K. Should probably be explained what constitutes smart
merging. Perhaps instead of "Yes" there should be name of default/smartest
merge strategy used?

12. Cherrypicks. What constitutes "Yes" here? Why "Somewhat" for Git?
It does have git-cherry-pick command for cherry picking...

13. Plugins. I would put "Somewhat" here, or "Scriptable" in the "Somewhat"
or "?" background color for Git. And add note that it is easy to script up
porcelanish command, and to add another merge strategy. There also was
example plugin infrastructure for Cogito, so I'd opt for "Someahwt"
marking.

14. Has Special Server. O.K.

15. Req. Dedicated Server. O.K.

16. Good Windows support. I'd put "Cygwin" instead of "No" for Git, although
with the same marking. And perhaps add note that Git relies heavily on
POSIX.

17 and 18. Fast Local Performance and Fast Network Performance. O.K.

19. Ease of Use. Hmmm... I don't know for Git. I personally find it very
easy to use, but I have not much experiences with other SCM. I wonder why
Bazaar has "No" there...


Too much rewriting to correct the page...
