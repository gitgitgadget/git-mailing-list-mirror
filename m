I don't think that will parse "%C(auto,foo)", as we hit the
!skip_prefix() of the conditional, and do not look for "auto," at all.

I think you'd have to move the check for "auto," inside the if block.

I'm leaning towards just writing it out the long way, though, as I did
in my reply to Junio.

Yeah, that is a bit more clear (the final conditional just needs to
check that we actually found a color).
