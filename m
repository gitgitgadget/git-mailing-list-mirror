I don't think I made myself clear. It's not a question of whether there
is something to commit. It's that when git asks the index "what is the
sha1 of the content at this path?", the index may be able to answer
directly (the file is up-to-date, so we return the index value), or it
may have to go to the filesystem and read the file content. It is this
latter which triggers convert_to_git(), which is what generates the
message in question.

For a more stripped-down example, try:

  git add foo
  git commit -m msg

versus:

  git add foo
  sleep 1
  git commit -m msg

In the latter case, we should not generally need convert_to_git() in the
"commit" step. It was already done by "git add", and we reuse the cached
result.

Whereas in the first one, we may run into the racy-index problem and
have to re-read the file to be on the safe side.
