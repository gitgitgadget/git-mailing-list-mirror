 Easy come, easy go Better to have loved and lost, than never have loved at all  Dream of a funeral and you hear of a marriage 

 The hand that rocks the cradle rules the world She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying. Eat well, stay fit, die anyway.  Easy come, easy go
