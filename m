What I think I've always wanted is something like the following
behavior for "git pull":

  * Fast forward if possible

  * Otherwise, rebase, but only if there are no conflicts at all

  * Otherwise, do the merge as normal, (leave conflict markers in
    place allowing the user to fix them up and then commit).

Would it be straightforward to turn your rebase merge strategy into
something like the above? And if so, would that address the primary
concerns that Junio raised?
