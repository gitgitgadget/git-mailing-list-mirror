I'd really like to see this merged, there was some discussion a couple 
of weeks ago (cf <4aed0293-6a48-d370-3b72-496b7c631cb5@gmail.com>), it 
petered out but no one seemed to be objecting to merging it.

the changes to sequencer.c looked good to me.

Yes please, there was a new version posted at the weekend but I've just 
checked and you've already picked it up in seen.
