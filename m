Hm,
I would agree that  Git should not wait for the filter.
But does the test suite need to wait for the filter ?
May be, in this case we test the filter and Git, which is good.
Adding a 1 second delay, if, and only if, there is a racy condition,
is not that bad (or do we have better ways to check for a process to
be terminated ?)
