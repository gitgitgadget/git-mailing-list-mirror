This is an improvement, in my opinion (and I agree that using your new
BUG for this last part would be better still). It also saves a process
in the common case.

One question:

Why does this cat go to descriptor 4? I get why you'd want it to (it's
meant for the user's eyes, and that's where 4 goes), but we do not
usually bother to do so for our helper functions (like test_cmp).

I don't think it matters usually in practice, because nobody tries to
capture the stderr of test_cmp, etc. I don't think it would ever hurt,
though. Should we be doing that for all the others, too?
