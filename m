IRIX (an ancient one).

Besides, Mono is darned slow.  Even Tcl/Tk is faster.

Furthermore, my complaint was not about a platform where neither C# nor 
Python work.  That is irrelevant.  If you have one platform where only one 
works, and another platform where only the other works, you cannot have a 
single program for both platforms.  Right?

Hth,
