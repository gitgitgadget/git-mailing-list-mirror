I tested this with an eye towards what I pointed out in
https://public-inbox.org/git/878ta8vyqe.fsf@evledraar.gmail.com/

Using the same workflow (search for "So what I was expecting" in that
E-Mail) this now does the right thing in that example:

    select lines? 4,10
    [...]
    $ git diff --staged -U1
    diff --git a/README.md b/README.md
    index ff990622a3..6d16f7e52b 100644

    u git ((49703a4754...) $) $

Some other comments on this:

1) It needs to be more obvious how to exit this sub-mode, i.e. consider
this confused user:

    Stage this hunk [y,n,q,a,d,/,j,J,g,s,e,l,?]? l
    select lines? ?
    invalid hunk line '?'
    select lines? q
    invalid hunk line 'q'
    select lines? exit
    invalid hunk line 'exit'
    select lines? quit
    invalid hunk line 'quit'
    select lines? :wq
    invalid hunk line ':wq'
    select lines? help
    invalid hunk line 'help'

Just doing Ctrl+D or RET exits it. Instead "?" should print some help
related to this sub-mode showing what the syntax is, and how to exit the
sub-mode. I think it would make sense for "q" to by synonymous with
"RET", i.e. you'd need "q<RET>q<RET>" to fully exit, but I don't know...

2) I think it's confusing UI that selecting some of the lines won't
re-present the hunk to you again in line mode, but I see this is
consistent with how e.g. "e" works, it won't re-present the hunk to you
if there's still something to do, you need to exit and run "git add -p"
again.

I think it makes sense to change that and you'd either "e" or "l" and
then "n" to proceed, or continue, but that's per-se unrelated to this
feature. Just something I ran into...

3) I don't see any way around this, but we need to carefully explain
that selecting a list of things in one session is *not* the same thing
as selecting them incrementally in multiple sessions. I.e. consider this
diff:

    @@ -1,3 +1,3 @@
    -a
    -b
    -c
    +1
    +2
    +3

If I select 1,4 I get, as expected:

    @@ -1,3 +1,3 @@
    -a
    +1
     b
     c

And then in the next session:

      @@ -1,3 +1,3 @@
       1
    1 -b
    2 -c
    3 +2
    4 +3
    select lines? 1,3

Yields, as expected:

    @@ -1,3 +1,3 @@
    -a
    -b
    +1
    +2
     c

But this is not the same as redoing the whole thing as:

    select lines? 1,4
    select lines? 1
    select lines? 3

Which instead yields:

    @@ -1,3 +1,3 @@
    -a
    -b
    +1
     c
    +3

Now, rummaging through my wetware and that E-Mail from back in March I
don't see how it could work differently, and you *also* want to be able
to select one line at a time like that.

Just something that's not very intuative / hard to explain, and maybe
there should be a different syntax (e.g. 1:4) for this "swap 1 for 4"
operation, as opposed to selecting lines 1 and 4 as they appear in the
diff.

4) With that abc 123 diff noted above, why am I in two sessions allowed
to do:

    @@ -1,3 +1,3 @@
    1 -a
    2 -b
    3 -c

    select lines? 1,4

To end up with this staged:

    @@ -1,3 +1,3 @@

I can do this in two steps.
