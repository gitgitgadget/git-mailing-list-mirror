Makes sense, and the implementation looks pretty clean.

A few small nits:

This free(prev) pattern is copied from builtin/checkout.c, where we have
multiple layers of options, each added by a function. So it requires
that callers duplicate the base set of options, and each subsequent
"add_foo_options()" concatenates that and frees the old one.

But here, we only have one layer, so in the caller which uses it:

> +static int cmd_multi_pack_index_repack(int argc, const char **argv)

we do a rather pointless dup() followed by free(). Perhaps not that big
a deal, and this would naturally extend to adding other option sets, so
it may even be considered future-proofing. But it did confuse me for a
moment.

However, we do end up leaking the return value from add_common_options()
at the end of the function:

This is definitely a harmless leak in the sense that we are going to
exit the program after midx_repack() returns anyway. But it might be
worth keeping things tidy, as we've recently seen a renewed effort to do
some leak-checking of the test suite. I _think_ we can just free the
options struct (even though we are still using the values themselves, we
don't care about the "struct options" anymore). But even if not, an
UNLEAK(options) annotation would do it.

(This doesn't apply to the other functions, because they just use
common_opts directly).
