You may be right. The main reason not to do it is the extra assignments
(and call to errno, which I think can be a function hidden behind a
macro these days). But I kind of doubt it is measurable, and we expect
malloc/free to be a bit heavyweight (compared to regular instructions)
anyway. So it is probably me being overly cautious about the performance
side.

The other reason is that macros (especially of system names) can create
their own headaches.  We could require xfree() everywhere as a
complement to xmalloc (or maybe even just places where the errno
preservation seems useful), but that's one more thing to remember.

With the patch below you can see both in action:

  - hyperfine seems to show the git_free() version as ~1% slower to run
    "git log" (which I picked as something that probably does a
    reasonable number of mallocs). Frankly, I'm still suspicious that it
    could have such an impact. Maybe inlining git_free() would help?

  - usually #defining free(ptr) with an argument will avoid confusion
    with the word "free" as a token. But in this case there's a function
    pointer which is then called as struct->free(ptr), causing
    confusion.
