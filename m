Because I'd been wanting to play with doc-diff and asciidoctor, I tried
looking at the rendered diff. However, I couldn't see any difference!

Did you notice this when building locally, or on the asciidoctor-built
pages at git-scm.com? If the latter, I wonder if we might need to update
our version of asciidoctor there (it looks like we're on v1.5.6.1 there,
but my local asciidoctor binary is v1.5.8).
