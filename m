Yes.

Imagine doing a shallow clone and then fetching a tree that includes a
blob that existed before MISSING. If we say HAVE without MISSING then
the server will not send that blob and we'll be left with a broken
tree.

Yeah, shallow clones can shake up the conventions a bit. It's
definitely common for a repository to only have a single parent-less
commit, such that there is always an identifiable merge base for any
pair of revisions. Shallow clones would make (effectively) parent-less
commits much more common.

Should be fun to see what things fall over with this...
