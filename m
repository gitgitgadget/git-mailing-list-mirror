Yeah, I think that's reasonable, and would be enabled by the %(worktree)
placeholder I showed. Just like we do something like:

  %(if)%(HEAD)%(then)* %(color:green)%(else)  %(end)

now, we could do:

  %(if)%(HEAD)%(then)* %(color:bold green)
  %(else)%(if)%(worktree)%(then)+ %(color:green)
  %(else)  %(end)%(end)

(respecting the user's color config, of course, rather than hard-coded
colors).

Trying that out, though, I'm not sure if we properly support nested
if's. That might be a bug we have to fix first.

We have that already, don't we?

Definitely.
