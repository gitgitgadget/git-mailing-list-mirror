Subject: [PATCH 10/11] read-cache: don't leave dangling pointer in `do_write_index()`

If `do_write_index(..., struct tempfile *, ...)` fails to close the
temporary file, it deletes it. This resets the pointer to NULL, but only
the pointer which is local to `do_write_index()`, not the pointer that
the caller holds. If the caller ever dereferences its pointer, we have
undefined behavior (most likely a crash). One of the two callers tries
to delete the temporary file on error, so it will dereference it.

We could change the function to take a `struct tempfile **` instead. But
we have another problem here. The other caller, `write_locked_index()`,
passes in `lock->tempfile`. So if we close the temporary file and reset
`lock->tempfile` to NULL, we have effectively rolled back the lock. That
caller is `write_locked_index()` and if it is used with the
`CLOSE_LOCK`-file, it means the lock is being rolled back against the
wishes of the caller. (`write_locked_index()` used to call
`close_lockfile()`, which would have rolled back on error. Commit
83a3069a3 (lockfile: do not rollback lock on failed close, 2017-09-05)
changed to not rolling back.)

Note also that if we would ever have failed to close the lockfile,
either with `COMMIT_LOCK` or with `CLOSE_LOCK`, that would have happened
already in `do_write_index()` and we would have left the lock in such a
state that trying to, e.g., roll it back or reopen the file would most
likely have crashed.

Do not delete the temporary file in `do_write_index()`. One caller will
avoid rolling back the lock, the other caller will delete its temporary
file anyway, and for both callers we will avoid crashes.

Expand the documentation on `write_locked_index()` to note that the lock
will never be rolled back when using `CLOSE_LOCK`. We can not yet make a
similar claim about `COMMIT_LOCK`; we'll fix that in the next commit.

It does feel a bit unfortunate that we simply "happen" to close the lock
by way of an implementation-detail of lockfiles. But note that we need
to close the temporary file before `stat`-ing it, at least on Windows.
See 9f41c7a6b (read-cache: close index.lock in do_write_index,
2017-04-26).
