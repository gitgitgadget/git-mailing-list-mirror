Who is running that chmod and why? I know you are trying to simulate
"somehow they lost their 'w' bit" here, but what is that "somehow"?

Git does not track write-bits. So any git checkout should always have
the bit set, no? And likewise would any tarball generated by
git-archive. Does tar lose it on extraction? I would not think it would
do so, short of a broken umask.

Confused...
