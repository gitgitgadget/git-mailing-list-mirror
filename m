I'm pleased to announce that Git has been accepted into Google's Summer
of Code program for 2012.

Our organization page is here:

  http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2012/git

We should expect students to start showing up on the list in the next
week to talk about potential projects. Please be extra helpful, and if
you have time, listen in on irc://irc.freenode.net/git to respond to
students there.

Student proposals will start coming the week after[1]. People who are
interested in being mentors can (and should) take part in the ranking of
proposals.  You can apply at the organization page above.
