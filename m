It ceased to be about kernel development, and fell into the normal development 
bucket :-)

Routine release notes (like your notes from the maintainer) do end up just 
getting links to them as you have seen. But if someone is summarizing the 
discussions on the mailing list, those will be a bit more interesting, and if 
there is a particularly hot topic, the summary of that discussion can be a full 
fledged article on it's own.
