Not going to disagree, but are you looking for the blame on the submodule ref file itself or files in the submodule? It's hard to teach git to do a blame on a one-line file.

Otherwise, and I think this is what you really are going for, teaching it to do a blame based on "git blame <path/to/submodule>/submodule/file" would be very nice and abstracts out the need for the user (or more importantly to me = scripts) to understand that a submodule is involved; however, it is opening up a very large door: "should/could we teach git to abstract submodules out of every command". This would potentially replace a significant part of the use cases for the "git submodule foreach" sub-command. In your ask, the current paradigm "cd <path/to/submodule>/submodule && git blame file" or pretty much every other command does work, but it requires the user/script to know you have a submodule in the path. So my question is: is this worth the effort? I don't have a good answer to that question. Half of my brain would like this very much/the other half is scared of the impact to the code.

Just my musings.
