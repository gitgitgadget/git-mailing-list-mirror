AFAICT this _fixes_ compilation in a patch containing spaces, not break 
it.

Yes, that MÃ¤rchen is a constant pain.  I think it is the reason Kai 
vanished: he does not want to bear the consequences of his wrong doing.

Of course, it has exposed errors regarding encoding in filenames.  But 
those are errors in the OSes (or in this case, MSys), and _not_ to be 
fixed within git.

Yes.  However, I inherently distrust Windows.  So I made a separate 
account on Windows.

NOTE: earlier installers included msys-rxvt.bat.  I now _know_ for a fact 
that a lot of things are strangely broken under Rxvt.  For example, 
creating an ssh key, of all things.

I'd be more than happy to add you to the member list.

Those "freezes" were due to the fact that Rxvt incorrectly updates stderr 
in a blocking way, or not at all (don't know which).  There are more 
things that do not work in Rxvt, and only after trying the same in cmd 
(which I do not like for various reasons) I found out that rxvt.exe is at 
fault.

I would be glad if somebody managed to compile rxvt herself and fix all 
those bugs (see http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/ for a short list of the 
most pressing issues I found).  As it is, I have enough work to do with 
the rest of msysGit, and for the moment, I can at least work in cmd.  Even 
ssh push works.

Never experienced those.

It never froze for me.  However, as stated, Rxvt is too workaroundable for 
me to work on it (although I like Rxvt better than cmd).  Any help 
appreciated very much.

gitk worked fine for me, as long as I had _any_ refs in the repo.

I have to wonder how you called it... From msys.bat, cd'ing into a valid 
repository, I had no issues whatsoever.

I just tested via VNC, and indeed, it does not work.  My guess is that 
MinGW's Tk version has a different number assigned to the scroll wheel 
(the scroll wheel is usually implemented as constant fire on a special 
mouse button; AFAICT buttons 4 and 5 are assumed to be the scroll buttons 
in gitk).

Now, I do not know what these are called on Windows, but there should be a 
thing like "xev" on Windows, too...  Anybody?

Ciao,
Dscho
