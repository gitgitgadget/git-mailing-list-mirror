I had assumed that the above paragraph

|	after the export can change the tag names (which can also happen
|	when excluding revisions) the signatures will not match.

was adaquate for that purpose, but we can maybe do better?

Fair enough.  My thinking was to keep the deprecation separate from
the main "happy path" text.

How about:

| Specify how to handle signed tags.  Since any transformation after the
| export (or during the export, such as excluding revisions) can change
| the hashes being signed, the signatures may not match.
|
| When asking to 'abort' (which is the default), this program will die
| when encountering a signed tag.  With 'strip', the tags will silently
| be made unsigned, with 'warn-strip' they will be made unsigned but a
| warning will be displayed, with 'verbatim', they will be silently
| exported and with 'warn-verbatim' (or 'warn', a deprecated synonym),
| they will be exported, but you will see a warning.  'verbatim' should
| not be used unless you know that no transformations affecting tags
| will be performed, or unless you do not care that the resulting tag
| will have an invalid signature.

Ack.

Yeah, that line made me nervous, but I figured if it was good enough
for the existing 'warn-strip' test, then it was good enough for
'warn-verbatim' too.
