Just chiming in that I can probably help mentoring whoever goes
with libgit2. I do not have enough spare time for me to promise
that I can be there as much as I think is necessary and proper,
but I'll gladly help out.

On a side-note, I think all mentors should urge the students in
the strongest possible terms to deliver their work to git@vger
as soon as possible. From previous years experience, successful
projects are those that the list sees code from within a week
or two after the project's started, while the projects that are
kept in the dark rarely (if ever?) finish successfully.
