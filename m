Very interesting. Thank you very much for this hint.

Is the used solution in git=E2=80=99s git repository a result of the proble=
m
with maintaining generated output from source files or does it have
other other advantages too?

When creating TeX documents =E2=80=93 at least in my work flow =E2=80=93 I =
always have
the PDF file open in parallel. Would that be a problem when having it in
a separate branch?

Also I guess that this is done automatically too (saying autogenerated
in `git log origin/man`). I could not find the script though.

        $ git grep Autogen
        git-gui/Makefile:        echo '# Autogenerated by git-gui Makefile'=
 >$@ && \
        git-gui/git-gui.sh:if {[gets $fd] eq {# Autogenerated by git-gui Ma=
kefile}} {

and searching for =C2=BBgit "Autogenerated manpages for"=C2=AB did not retu=
rn
anything useful for me.

Additionally I am confused where the SHA id g43f9f in =C2=BBAutogenerated
manpages for v1.7.4.1-42-g43f9f=C2=AB comes from. I could not find that
commit in `origin/master` or `git log v1.7.4.1`.

The last thing is that in git=E2=80=99s git repository the autogeneration o=
f the
manual pages does not seem to happen every commit (Is it a cron job?).
In my use case the PDF file should be generated after every commit. Is a
separate branch the way to go here?


Thanks,

Paul
