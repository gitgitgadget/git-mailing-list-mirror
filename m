A custom port can always be set via environment variables, though the
user has to remember to set it (I doubt that I would remember it until
reminded by test failures...)

I wanted to imply only the bare minimum of options that are necessary
to prevent the tests from stomping on each other.  Other than that I
agree and wouldn't run '--stress' without '-x -i' myself, and at one
point considered to recommend '-x -i' in the description of
'--stress'.

At least the INT/TERM/etc. handler should say something like "Waiting
for background jobs to finish", to let the user know why it doesn't
exit right away.

An alternative would be to exit right away, and make the background
loops a tad bit smarter to not print these progress lines when
aborting.

Yeah, that's why I added this ABORTED case.  When I hit ctrl-C, a
couple of the tests tend to fail, but that's not the rare failure we
are hoping to find when stress testing, so printing FAIL would be
misleading.  The test script exits with 1 all the same, so we can't
tell the difference, but since rare failures are, well, rare, this
failure is most likely due to the abort.

OK, I think the abort handler should append, not overwrite, and then
the file's contents should be checked e.g. with a case statement
looking for *aborted*.

Or use two separate files for signaling abort and test failure.

In any case, you could always grab the job number from the "FAIL X.Y"
line, and then look at its logs and trash direcory.

I just don't like when test output, especially with '-x', is dumped on
my terminal :)

You can tab-complete most of the trash directory, and then there are
only those 1-2-3 digits of the job number that you have to type.  That
worked out well enough for me so far (but I've only used it for a few
days, so...).

We could rename the trash directory of the failed test to something
short, sweet, and common, but that could be racy in the unlikely case
that two tests fail at the same time.  And I like the 'trash
directory.' prefix, because then 'make clean' will delete that one,
too, without modifying 't/Makefile' (which is also the reason for
adding the 'stress-N' suffix instead of a prefix, and putting the fail
file into the 'test-results' directory).
