=46or the record, I don't want them deleted but replaced with the
artifacts in the other branch. A bit wasteful but it saves a lot of
build time.

=46or small changes that makes perfect sense. I'm at a stage where APIs
are still evolving and changing an API means rebuilding lots of code.
I'd like to avoid that.

While Eclipse isn't great at detecting such changes, this isn't really
an Eclipse problem. It's just that lots of things are still changing
and that leads to lots of building.

As I mentioned above, I don't want to *delete* untracked/ignored
files, I just want them to stick to the branch I was working on. So if
I change to a different branch I get the appropriate build artifacts.

Something like: git stash --everything "All artifacts for
this-branch." && git checkout other-branch && git stash apply
stash-for-other-branch.
