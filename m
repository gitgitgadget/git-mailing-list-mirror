I think I share the same feeling.  As long as the chance is small
enough that the pack reordering creates a new cycle, the resulting
pack would not become too bloated by the last-ditch cycle breaking
code and finding a replacement delta instead of inflating it may not
be worth the trouble.

It worries me a lot to lose the warning unconditionally, though.
That's the (only) coal-mine canary that lets us notice a problem
when we actually start hitting that last-ditch cycle breaking too
often.
