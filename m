So upon re-reading the git-svn docs, there apparently _are_  
"--preserve-empty-dirs" and "--placeholder-filename=<filename>" options.

I'm not sure how I missed these.  :-/

If I understand correctly, it sounds like exactly what I want.  i.e. a  
placeholder file being added (and tracked) to each empty folder.  Are  
there known issues or limitations to be aware of?


Thank you,
