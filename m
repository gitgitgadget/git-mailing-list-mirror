Yeah, I think it would be best to have one track, but have breakout
periods where people can work on stuff together or have smaller
conversations, or even have smaller rooms that people can go into to
work for a while.

I really want to have one track though - I'm personally interested in
everything.  I want to know how Gerrit is working these days and
different workflows and stuff.  I think we have enough time where even
with 50 or 60 people we could have everyone who wanted to speak (which
isn't going to be everybody) have a chance without being too crazy.
