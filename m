While I was playing chess, unsuspectingly, there were 40 mails in this 
useless thread.  You sent 15 of them.

Now, just making a _conservative_ guess, git@vger.kernel.org has about 
50000 subscribers (I know for a fact this figure is too low, so it is 
conservative).

I estimate all except for 10 of them, let's be conservative, 100, did not 
care about your lognorrhea.  They needed at least 0.5 seconds to delete 
those mails _you_ are responsible for.

Congratulations, you cost at least 500 seconds today.  And many nerves.

The sad thing: I read about two people the other day, Singh and McKinstry, 
who I'd rather see writing mails here.

I don't care if you honour my contributions to git.  I don't care about 
you.

You must get a kick out of annoying people.  Why don't you try to play 
chicken with a train?

Ciao,
Dscho
