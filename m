It's actually hard to do accurately. We don't know how many objects are
reachable until we traverse the graph...which is exactly what the
"checking connectivity" operation is doing.

The operation is bounded by the total number of objects in the
repository. We may have duplicates (in multiple packs, or loose/packed),
and objects which aren't reachable at all. But we could make that a
guess, and just "jump" to 100% at the end.

The code might look something like the patch below. I'm not sure if it's
a good idea or not (I mostly copied the counting from
builtin/count-objects.c; it might be nice to factor that out).
