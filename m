In the quoted text above, Ã†var mentioned that many users will have a
pull-request workflow tracking one upstream. So no, I don't think it's
just for me, but anybody with that workflow.

But of course i also mentioned other workflows, like...

That's exactly what I was talking about in the quoted text above.  If
you use --set-upstream, then your local "topic" will track something
like "origin/topic".

I agree it's hard to follow. It's probably only useful for people who
want to modify it to create a custom format (and any documentation could
certainly explain it in human-readable terms and then make a mention of
the actual code).

I'm not quite sure what you think I'm proposing, but it's certainly not
that people would type in that code on the command line. It's that "-v"
would be documented to behave _as if_ that code had been used with
--format.  And then extended to use another format of the user's choice
from a config variable (which could be based on that format, if they so
chose).

Of course they can do that already with an alias. The only thing I'm
actually suggesting is making "-v" configurable.

I'm saying that I find your proposed value for that default to be
useless, and I suspect many other users will, too. Which is why making
it configurable may actually help people.

Don't bother on my account. I have generally found that going more than
one round deep of discussion with you does not lead anywhere productive,
and I don't intend to continue this thread.
