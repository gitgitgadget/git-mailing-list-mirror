  I'm not sure if this is really an improvement on the current state,
but then again, the current state pretty much matches my idea and maybe
others will agree that your proposal is better. Thus, it's better to
show this to the Git community at large. :-)

  If you or anyone is shooting for a re-design, I would suggest to
somehow relate to the current "Git brandings" in use:

	http://henrik.nyh.se/uploads/git-logo.png

  If you think you have a cooler logo, that's fine too, but then it's
again better to present it explicitly, I believe. The latter is used
especially within mSysGit, the former is used more widely - at the
current homepage, as Gitweb logo, and in various modifications like
