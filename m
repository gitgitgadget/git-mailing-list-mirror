Hello everyone,

I've been given the task to prepare an introduction on Git for my
company, as lots of people are interested by Git, and I'm one of the
most advanced user, as I started using git about 2 or 3 weeks ago...
Due to my lack of experience, and not wanting to taught wrong things,
I'm looking for one or more good french git user/developper to give a
quick look to my slides, and tell me if I went wrong somewhere.

Thanks in advance

Nicolas Morey-Chaisemartin
