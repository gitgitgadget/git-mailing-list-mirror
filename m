Yeah, I don't feel strongly at all. I like consistency, but noticing
bogus input is good, too. ;)

Ultimately I think using the parse-options API would be nice. In the
meantime, I suspect (but didn't think too hard on it) that you could get
by with two helpers:

  - rename the current opt_with_value() to opt_with_optional_value()
    to make its assumptions clear.

  - add a new helper opt_with_required_value() that accepts either:

      --default <arg>
      --default=<arg>
      --disambiguate <arg>
      --disambiguate=<arg>
      etc...

     and complains when the "=" is missing, or there is no extra "<arg>"
     available.

The second helper is a little tricky to write, because it sometimes
needs to advance argv (and decrement argc) to account for the extra
consumed arg.

That's definitely something we can leave off for now, though.

I don't find it hard to believe that there's no obvious pattern. :) I
would say that rev-parse is one of the messiest and most "organically
grown" parts of Git.

Thanks for digging, though. It is always nice to see contributors going
the extra mile to figure out how their solutions fit into the bigger
picture of the project.
