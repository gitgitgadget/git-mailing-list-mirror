Makes sense.

Nope. I haven't looked into it, but I think there would be some benefit
to replacing packed_git_mru with the code in list.h. But I don't see any
benefit in replacing packed_git with that, or with the MRU itself (once
list.h is in use, one _could_ shove the MRU into packed_git itself, but
I think we would still retain the original link order for reference).

Thanks for asking.
