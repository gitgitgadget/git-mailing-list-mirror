Hi Felipe, Sverre and Avery,

Okay. I hope you get the point- we didn't have Johannes being pulled
up like this before, atleast after I joined the community.

The current issue is solved. Johannes apologized, Amir apologized and
I apologized on behalf of the community. Everyone is happy. The first
step towards correcting a problem is recognizing it- we have succeeded
in doing that and resolving it amicably.

It's okay to have another admin- I don't think anyone opposes the
idea. Just that I think it's a little inappropriate to have a proposal
for it in an email with the current admin blamed in the subject
line. If the need for another administrator is felt, we can start a
new thread with some suitable candidates and decide amicably keeping
Johannes in the loop. The purpose of the administrator should not be
to "attack", but rather work with Johannes, helping him cope with the
work load. I'm sure Johannes would be happy to have someone else
working with him as well :)

Very nicely put- I have to agree. We have to stop blaming Johannes and
start blaming ourselves and work towards a solution together; example:
have one more admin.
