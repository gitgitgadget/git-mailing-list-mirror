A section on usual workflows and setups would be most useful. Some  
like a pull/push workflow, others a email based workflow.

As for learning git stuff, I usually point new users to your stuff :).  
I also point them to Tommi Virtanen "Git for Computer Scientists":http://eagain.net/articles/git-for-computer-scientists/ 
. It was that article that made it all "click" for me regarding git.

Best regards,
