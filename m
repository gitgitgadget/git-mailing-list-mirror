It took me a minute to understand how 9da69a6539 made this worse, since
in the hunk you're touching here, the original "if NULL, do nothing"
check was checking the pointer-to-pointer to see if the caller was
interested in the lockfile name. But your "but put it right at the
source" pointed me in the right direction. The hunk from 9da69a6539 that
matters is this one:

  -       if (pack_lockfile) {
  -               printf("lock %s\n", pack_lockfile);
  +       if (pack_lockfiles.nr) {
  +               int i;
  +
  +               printf("lock %s\n", pack_lockfiles.items[0].string);
                  fflush(stdout);
  +               for (i = 1; i < pack_lockfiles.nr; i++)
  +                       warning(_("Lockfile created but not reported: %s"),
  +                               pack_lockfiles.items

(not complaining about anything, just verbosely reviewing).

So this is an obviously correct fix, but I have to wonder whether we
ought to be (even before 9da69a6539) complaining about pack-objects not
correctly reporting the pack name to us. I think in practice this
happens when it dies early without reporting anything to us, in which
case we'd notice its non-zero exit anyway. So it's probably not a big
deal, but would amount to an assertion (and if we did want to do it, it
should come on top of your fix, and not hold it up).
