Dear diary, on Wed, Apr 13, 2005 at 11:25:46PM CEST, I got a letter
where Christopher Li <git@chrisli.org> told me that...

Well, unless Linus will want me otherwise, I'd like to postpone this
until I'm finally done with the damn merge - enough things already got
into my way today, so I would really like to focus on this tomorrow. So
I'll be probably merging only (or mostly) bugfixes until I have that
finished.

P.S.: Just staring at
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/04/11/torvalds_attack/ ... I'm nothing
like a regular reader of (R), but I thought the guys have at least a bit
of sense. Duh. :/ Or is April 11 now yet another joke day after April 1?
