Unfortunately, I think it has been broken for five years.

The problem introduced in that commit is that each iteration through the
loop advances the tree pointers. But when we're walking two lists and
see that one omits an entry the other has, we have to advance _one_ list
and keep the other where it is. So if we instrument the score_*
functions to see which ones trigger, your reproduction gives this with
the original code:

  warning: scoring trees:
    8e12d9b6bc57fe6308315914628dd4fd7665ca59
    aed1d7c5809e53d49b52c43a6103827046d60286

  warning: score_differs: README.adoc
  warning: score_missing: appveyor.yml
  warning: score_matches: autogen.sh

  [...]

and the new one does:

  warning: scoring trees:
    8e12d9b6bc57fe6308315914628dd4fd7665ca59
    aed1d7c5809e53d49b52c43a6103827046d60286

  warning: score_differs: README.adoc
  warning: score_missing: appveyor.yml
  warning: score_missing: autogen.sh
  warning: score_missing: book.json

We're fine at first, but as soon as one tree has appveyor.yml and the
other doesn't, we get out of sync. We compare "autogen" and "appveyor",
and realize that they do not match. But then we need to increment
pointer for the tree with "appveyor" only, and leave the other in place,
at which point we'd realize that they both have "autogen". Instead, we
increment both, and after that we compare "autogen.sh" to "book.json",
and so on.

So the assertion in that commit message that "the calls to
update_tree_entry() are not needed any more" is just wrong. We have
decide whether to call it based on the "cmp" value.

I quoted your original reproduction below for the benefit of RenÃ©
(cc'd).
