Thanks, I wasn't quite clear on whether there was an escape hatch for
people who were broken (I took Ã†var's "perhaps we should follow this up"
meaning we needed to add new knobs, but it is really just "perhaps we
should set this existing knob by default on AIX"). So that at least
quells the worst of my worries.

After that, I agree it's now just a question of the default. I don't
have a sense whether the majority is helped or hurt here (I admit that I
did not even know about these flags, despite compiling with gcc for the
past 13 years, so possibly everybody was perfectly happy with the
existing behavior).
