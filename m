I was trying to keep the name small since it is a static-local
convenience helper. I'd rather write it as:

  stream_blob(1, oid);

than change the name. ;)

Yes, I'd agree (there are very few cases where I think STDOUT_FILENO
actually increases the readability, since it is usually pretty clear
from the context when something is a descriptor).
