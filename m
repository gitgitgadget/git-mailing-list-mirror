To answer this, it probably would make more sense to bundle this
change together with one which (from [1]):

    [...] improves git-worktree documentation to do a better job of
    pointing people at -d/--detach as a way to side-step unwanted
    branch creation [...]. That is, at minimum, enhance the
    "Description" section to prominently talk about throwaway
    worktrees (created with -d/--detach), and add an example to the
    "Examples" section (perhaps as the first example) showing
    creation/use/deletion of a throwaway worktree.

Toward that goal, adding the '-d' alias for '--detach' helps promote
throwaway worktrees as a first-class concept supported by
git-worktree. As mentioned in [1]:

    "git worktree add -d foo" is about as easy to type and remember as
    "git worktree add foo"

I'd have no problem leaving this as '[--detach]'; readers can discover
the short alias easily enough where '--detach' is discussed without
mentioning it here.

I fully agree with this assessment and was going to say the same.
'-b' and '-B' are special in that they don't have corresponding long
option names, thus they must be shown in short form, but long name
'--detach' is much more informative in this context (and the reader
can discover short '-d' easily enough without mentioning it here).
So, I'd drop this change (and the other similar one).
