Hello, everyone.

I was peering over the previous years' GSoC ideas for Git, and I wish
to apply to work with Git in the upcoming GSoC '11. I found the
Restartable Clone idea from the GSoC 2008 ideas page interesting, and
am keen on working on it. I'm a basic C/C++/Python programmer, and my
previous programming experience has mainly been related to maths,
algorithms and logic, pretty much formal-education stuff. I was taught
basic C in high school and I spent time in expanding to C++ and
Python. I have coded a few applications in these languages out of my
own whim, and have been dabbling in shell-scripting for a while. I
have no Open Source development experience, but I've brought myself
upto speed with how open source communities work, and the mandatory
tools like vcs, bugtrackers, patches, compiling from source, etc.

That said, I'd like to know if my programming knowledge will suffice
to apply as a student for Git in GSoC. If so, I'd like to get started
on the Restartable Clone idea and start learning the necessary stuff
and work on it :)

Thanks,
Pranav.
