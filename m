One case where I imagine they are kept is in remote-helpers that use the
import/export mechanism (e.g., something interacting with remote-hg). I
suspect people there just live with the somewhat lousy packs, and then
perhaps occasionally "git repack -adf". That would give them .rev files
then, too.

But as I said, I think it's OK to ignore this for now. If somebody with
an interest in fast-import wants to add support later, they can.
