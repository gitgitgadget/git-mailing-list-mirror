I dunno. It seems like this requires a lot of caveats for people using
subshells and shell functions, and I suspect it's going to be an
on-going maintenance burden.

That said, I'm not opposed if you want to do the work to try to get the
whole test-suite clean, and we can see how it goes from there. It
shouldn't be hurting anything, I don't think, aside from some
mysterious-looking redirects (but your commit messages seem to explain
it, so anybody can dig).

Does it make descriptor 7 magical, and something that scripts should
avoid touching? That would mean we have 2 magical descriptors now.
