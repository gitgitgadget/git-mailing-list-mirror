Okay, okay, I already had one shot, but here's another:

<silly>
Let's call it "American PI minus one" release. Since Americans love to 
fsck up the dates, they would write the month first, then the day, 
which ends up being 2.14, which is exactly PI - 1 rounded to three digits! 

Alternatively, since they really write 2/14, we could call it the "one 
seventh" release...
</silly>

Enough already,
Dscho
