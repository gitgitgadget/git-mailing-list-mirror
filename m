Heh, I literally just implemented this kind of max-count in my own
"stress" script[1] to handle this recent t0025 testing. So certainly I
think it is a good idea.

Picking an <N> is tough. Too low and you get a false negative, too high
and you can wait forever, especially if the script is long. But I don't
think there's any real way to auto-scale it, except by seeing a few of
the failing cases and watching how long they take.

Patch looks good. A few observations:

You switch to 1-indexing the counts here. I think that makes sense,
since otherwise --stress-limit=300 would end at "1.299", etc.

I think I'd argue that this missing stress_exit is a bug in the original
script, and somewhat orthogonal to the limit counter. But I don't think
it's worth the trouble to split it out (and certainly the theme of "now
you can run this via bisect" unifies the two changes).
