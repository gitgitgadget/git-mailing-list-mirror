Let me clarify what I said. I hope everyone who is interested will sign
up to be a potential mentor, and will help by reading and ranking
student proposals. And I include both you and me in that everyone.

But somebody needs to be the officially designated admin and the last
word on decisions, and I thought that was going to be Shawn. If you (or
anyone else) wants to do it, I would be fine with that. But I do not
feel comfortable taking on the responsibility myself.

I am not becoming a father. I am already a father, and trust me, a
newborn baby is time-consuming.
