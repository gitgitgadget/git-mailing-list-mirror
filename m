Summary:

request:
  Dear Mr Torvalds, help me please to make Ubuntu team
  create or approve such a patch which would implement this:
  > Ubuntu needs an API like Firefox's XML DOM, but in C, not Javascript.

  I failed at understanding more valuable information.

my reply:
==========
git kernel list is unlikely to be the appropriate forum.
Try #ubuntu channel on freenode irc or http://ubuntuforums.org/

Also refine your request. Its not understandable (yet). Talk to other
linux users and make them understand what you're idea is.

I personally can't imagine what you're asking for because there are so
many things which could be mapped to DOM including filesystem, linux
configuration (/proc, /sys), ...

You may want to look at "plan 9", they try to make everything be a 
filesystem => http://cs-exhibitions.uni-klu.ac.at/index.php?id=214
"Ken and Rob thought up the idea of building everything around a single
file system protocol" ...
So all you have to do is map the filesystem to DOM and you're done?

You should find an appropriate forum for discussing and maturing your
idea. Those forums will also help you make it complete enough such that
average linux users / developers have a chance to understand what you
really have in mind.

I feel its unlikely that Torvalds understands what you are talking about
either without providing samples etc.

If you don't understand what I'm writing about contact me off list and
and I'll help you find the appropriate forum and rephrase your idea
making your description good enough to make others understand how you
want ubuntu (linux in general?) to look like instead.

If we're done with that we can write another mail to this thread telling
where future discussion will take place. To speed everything up I've
started a titanpad document:

http://titanpad.com/pVtrCuSOr5
and put some questions / comments there.

You can also add additional references to discussions at the appropriate
places to that public document.
