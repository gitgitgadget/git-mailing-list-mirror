Heh, that's very kind.  Yes, it is actually my list, but I never use
it so I often forget I put things onto it.  I think I actually use
it as a way to bookmark something I'm looking at on Amazon, and then
never wind up going back to because I just didn't get around to it.

Last year my thoughtful wife bought my birthday gift from my Amazon
wish list.  It was a DVD set that I had wanted, but many months
before my birthday I had viewed the entire series through Netflix
and totally forgot it was on an Amazon wish list.  She had no clue
and wound up purchasing the DVDs for me anyway.  :)

Hah!  Amazon is dangerous that way.  Looking things up by name.
Email is usually slightly more unique...
