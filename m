Yes, and it was not the topic.  So I pointed out your hypocrisy since
_you_ talk about editor preferences and "normal" people, while
preferring an editor yourself that is used by far fewer people.

You are still unable to focus on anything but name-calling and editors
rather than documentation formats.

We were discussing Texinfo, not Emacs.  Please focus.

Again, you are speaking for the rest of the world, conveniently
ignoring that more people use such a system than the one you use.  But
please stop focusing on editors and focus on documentation formats.

Which is why books nowadays always come as a single scroll without
index and table of contents, right?  Ask any normal person.

Yes, name-calling and ad hominem attacks again.  It's getting old.  So
you think a single large html page containing everything in the
git/Documentation directory is the way we should organize git
documentation for the sake of the users?  All manual pages one after
the other, and some text in between explaining the connections?  In
one large file?

While harping on my sanity and normality because of contemplating
something more structured?

Please.

For what it's worth: Texinfo documents _can_ be converted into a
single HTML file as _well_ as a hierarchically split document with a
hyperlinked index.  So using Texinfo as a source format would _still_
allow preparing HTML in both multiple and single file form for the
sake of Torvalds-normal users.

Please try to remember that Texinfo is a _source_ format, and it
produces reasonably hyperrefed and coherent PDF and HTML documents as
well as plain ASCII.  That it is also able to produce working info
files should not bother you.
