Dear diary, on Mon, Apr 25, 2005 at 11:33:12PM CEST, I got a letter
where Andreas Gal <gal@uci.edu> told me that...

I skimmed over it briefly and admitelly didn't find anything
*obviously* borrowed from my scripts, so I wanted to ask. It is worth
noting explicitly, I think.

I was not offended, just confused. :-) I think it's better not to use
"GNU" in the name if it's not part of the GNU project.
