There's already an issue here:

  https://github.com/git/git-scm.com/issues/1521

But I think there's a larger problem within Git's manpages themselves.
There is no manpage version of many of the pages, yet git.txt still
links to them. So "man git" on my system points to to several file://
urls that doesn't exist. This is true of my custom-built Git, but I
think also true for some system package setups (e.g., Debian's "git"
package ships the manpages, but you don't get the html versions unless
you install "git-doc" as well).
