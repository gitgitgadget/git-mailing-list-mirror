Hi,

Yesterday I cloned the official git repository and for fun I checkout
out the first ever commit "e83c5163316f..."

So how did Linus get those first few commits / history into the official
git repository? Was the first 8 C source code files already enough to
work as a basic git repository?  Or did he use another revision control
system and then later imported that history into the official git
repository (when git was working)?

Just curious?  :-)


Regards,
  - Graeme -
