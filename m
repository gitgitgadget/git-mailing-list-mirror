 i trust that the above subject-line comment, or more specifically its
constituent links, begins to hint at why i believe it is important
that git-over-p2p be given a higher priority than it is at present.
you can easily join the dots to see where this government insanity is
going: it won't be long before this insanity is utilised to take
control of free software web sites just because they happen to be
hosting tools which MIGHT be utilised "for copyright infringment".
it's bad enough that the DMCA exists and can be used to intimidate
sourceforget into removing rtmpdump - now imagine if someone decided
to take control of sourceforget ok actually yeah maybe that's not so
great a loss after all but it's the PRINCIPLE damnit :)
