I can't reproduce it. I cloned the repo and then edited the file at line 
60 with a diff that looks something like:

  diff --git a/glacierupload.sh b/glacierupload.sh
  index 3b956c7..265349b 100755
  --- a/glacierupload.sh
  +++ b/glacierupload.sh
  @@ -57,7 +57,9 @@ fi
   
   # count the number of files that begin with "$prefix"
   fileCount=$(ls -1 | grep "^$prefix" | wc -l)
  -echo "ðŸ“¦ Glacier Upload with $AWS_PROFILE"
  +bar
  +echo "ðŸ“¦ Glacier s Upload with $AWS_PROFILE"
  +foo
   echo "Total parts to upload: " $fileCount
   
   # get the list of part files to upload.  Edit this if you chose a different prefix in the split command

I tried a bunch of combinations if partially staging parts of this diff, 
but everything worked fine without any error message. The emoji didn't 
render properly (though that might be my font's problem), but there were 
no problems in partial staging or unstaging.

Does this example work fine on your system or does it error out? Could 
you give an example diff where git-gui has problems while staging? Maybe 
something in your config is different?
