No, you shouldn't have gotten anything yet. I only meant that since I am
pointing Outreachy applicants to the GSoC ideas page, people who signed
up to mentor GSoC may effectively be called on to mentor for Outreachy
instead.

It's basically the same commitment, which is why I was comfortable doing
it without asking beforehand (but again, please speak up if you don't
agree).
