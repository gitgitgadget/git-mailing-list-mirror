Nicely written overall. I found a few typos / formatting issues.

An HTML entity seems to have snuck in. The source is utf8, so we can
just say Ã¯.

Yep, I think this nicely builds up the logic explaining the need for the
midx .rev file.

I guess the asciidoc-formatted version of this makes these nicely
italicized and subscripted. Personally I think pack(o) and o1 would be
more readable in the source (which is what I would tend to read). Or
maybe backticks if you want to be fancy.

A few more HTML bits in the comparison operators.
