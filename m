I was in a similar situation myself when I decided to apply for Git as
a GSoC student last year, your description makes me wonder "why git"
though, any particular reason?

Almost all students require such handholding, that's what the mentors
are for ;).

Showing your face early and asking around is a good thing to do as
prospective student, good luck :).

I'd say, step one in your path to being a GSoC student with git would
be to subscribe to the mailing list. Read the "A note from the
maintainer" mails Junio sends out, as well as his "What's cooking"
mails. Do some research on the topic you are interested in (e.g.,
search gmane.org's git archive for discussions on the topic, etc). You
might also want to hang out in #git on irc.freenode.net and get to
know people there.
