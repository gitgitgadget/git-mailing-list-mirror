Dear diary, on Sun, May 29, 2005 at 11:15:24PM CEST, I got a letter
where Jonas Fonseca <fonseca@diku.dk> told me that...

I'm confused. Are you suggesting that we just throw away any local
changes when updating? That sounds horrible - it's something the user
has full right not to expect and I'd be very careful about it.

In the longer term we shouldn't muck with diff | patch but instead do a
three-way merge on the local changes too.
