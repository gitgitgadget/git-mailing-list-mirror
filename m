I agree, which is why I asked the original question instead of posting it as a formal patch. We would probably get a brand new CVE implementing the proposed proto-changes even if the original intent was internal trusted repositories only. That's why I asked this as a "Best Practices" type question, which I think I have a better idea on now. The actual situation is rather cool from a DevOps point of view, and whatever the ultimate solution is, might make for a nice presentation at some future conference ðŸ˜‰.

Cheers and thanks,
