I still can't see how setup.c:get_common_dir_noenv() could be
responsible for the behavior you're describing of _any_ Git command
erroring out due to _any_ worktree being incompletely-initialized.
However, I can imagine "git worktree add" itself being racy and
failing due to a missing or empty "commondir" file for some other
worktree since that command _does_ consult other worktree entries when
validating the "add" operation via
builtin/worktree.c:validate_worktree_add() which calls
get_worktrees(). If get_worktrees() is subject to that raciness
problem, then "git worktree add" will inherit that undesirable
raciness behavior (as will other "git worktree" commands which call
get_worktrees(), such as "git worktree list").

So, I'm suspecting get_worktrees() or some function it calls (and so
on) as the racy culprit.
