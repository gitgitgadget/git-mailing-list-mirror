I think an init-less deployment like that is already broken. If we
encounter any error at all in upload-pack we may quit without reaping
all of our children. And this could never be protected against entirely;
we could be killed by SIGSEGV, SIGKILL, etc.

My understanding is container deployments often have a tiny pid-1 init
that takes care of zombie processes like this (but it's not something
I've dealt with much myself).

Here's an easy reproduction. On a clone of something large-ish (by
number of objects) like linux.git:

  - make sure you don't have bitmaps on (since they make the enumerating
    phase go quickly). For linux.git it takes ~30s or so to walk the
    whole graph on my machine.

  - run "git clone --no-local -q . dst"; the "-q" is important because
    if pack-objects is writing progress to upload-pack (to get
    multiplexed over the sideband to the client), then it will notice
    pretty quickly the failure to write to stderr

  - kill just upload-pack with "pkill git-upload-pack" or whatever you
    like

  - run "ps au | grep pack-objects" (or just "top") to see pack-objects
    chugging on 100% CPU (and consuming 1GB+ of RAM)

With the patch adding clean_on_exit, that last step turns up nothing.

Now the situation above is probably pretty rare. Nobody is usually going
to kill upload-pack specifically. The more common case is when
upload-pack realizes that the client (or the network) has gone away,
because it tries to write and finds the connection gone. But what is it
writing? Most of the time it's stuff from pack-objects! So in the normal
case, pack-objects is continually writing either data or progress
reports, so it would notice for its next write.

But again, a client asking for no progress is a problem. upload-pack
will be sending keepalives every 5s or so, so it will notice client
death then. But pack-objects will keep running, not generating any
output until it starts spewing the pack.

So you could probably make the scenario above a bit more realistic by
killing the parent git-clone process. But don't use ^C; that will send
SIGINT to all of the processes. Simulate a network failure by killing
the "git clone" process specifically. This shows the same problem, and
the same improvement after the patch (though remember it may take up to
5 seconds for upload-pack to send a keepalive and notice the problem).
