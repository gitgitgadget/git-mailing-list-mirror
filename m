e vehicle, and which will cover any portion of your car's exterior surf=
ace.

sure and awareness. The auto wraps tend to be colorful, eye-catching an=
d attract lots of attention. Plus, it's a form of advertising with a ca=
ptive audience,meaning people who are stuck in traffic can't avoid seei=
ng the wrapped car alongside them. This program will last for 3 months =

al"payment for letting PEPSI use the space no fee is required from you =
