We will want to keep the number small so we never recycle the file
handles. Instead, we will keep them open for the entire process.

The strategies for creating these graphs should include a "merge"
strategy that keeps the number of commit-graph files very small
(fewer than 5 should be sufficient).

Since we have a predefined "sequence" of graphs, the graph_pos
will be the position in the "meta-order" given by concatenating
the commit lists from each commit-graph. We then navigate to a commit
in O(num graphs) instead of O(1).

In the commit-graph format, we will use this "meta-order" number
to refer to parent positions.

Yes, this will continue to be useful*. To find the position inside
a specific commit-graph-N file, take the graph_pos and subtract the
number of commits in the "lower" commit-graph files.

* For example, this meta-data information is necessary for the Bloom
filter data [1].
