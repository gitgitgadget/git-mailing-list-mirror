I don't care that much (and I wasn't actually planning to push the fold
stuff into a patch, but would instead leave it to you people who were
already working on improving the ci script output ;) ).

Apparently there are exportable bash functions for all of this:

  http://www.garbers.co.za/2017/11/01/code-folding-and-timing-in-travis-ci/

but they're not part of the official API. So relying on them may be even
more questionable than relying on the travis_fold syntax.
