Hi Stefan

Thanks for all your comments on this, they've been really helpful.

The docs for python2 state[1]

  Leading whitespace (spaces and tabs) at the beginning of a logical
  line is used to compute the indentation level of the line, which in
  turn is used to determine the grouping of statements.

  First, tabs are replaced (from left to right) by one to eight spaces
  such that the total number of characters up to and including the
  replacement is a multiple of eight (this is intended to be the same
  rule as used by Unix). The total number of spaces preceding the
  first non-blank character then determines the lineâ€™s
  indentation. Indentation cannot be split over multiple physical
  lines using backslashes; the whitespace up to the first backslash
  determines the indentation.

As I understand it that fits with the "visual" indentation implemented
by this patch.

For python3 adds a third paragraph[2]

  Indentation is rejected as inconsistent if a source file mixes tabs
  and spaces in a way that makes the meaning dependent on the worth of
  a tab in spaces; a TabError is raised in that case.

My impression is that people generally avoid mixing tabs and spaces in
python3 code, in which case I wonder if the "visual" indentation
combined with a suitable setting for core.whitespace to highlight
erroneous tabs/spaces would be enough. (I'm not a python programmer so I
could be completely wrong on that)

In any case the more I think about it the more convinced I am that
having a move detection mode for "pythonic" indentation is a mistake. If
a line is added with dodgy indentation then it is a problem whether or
not it has been moved so I think this should be handled by the
whitespace error highlighting. This would allow a single mode for move
detection with an indentation change.

I just meant that the move detection should pretend the whitespace
errors do not exist.

It only works if the blank lines get moved with the non-blank lines
around it, then it matches the normal moved behavior I think. I'd like
to have it include blank context lines where the lines either side have
the same indentation change but that is trickier to implement.

As I said above I've more or less come to the view that the correctness
of pythonic indentation is orthogonal to move detection as it affects
all additions, not just those that correspond to moved lines.

I wrote this because I was re-factoring some shell code than was using a
indentation step of four spaces but with tabs in the leading indentation
which the current mode does not handle.

That's a good idea if we retain two separate modes

I only want to skip '\r' if it isn't part of "\r\n" at the end of the
line. (similar to way --ignore-cr-at-eol does not ignore a trailing '\r'
on an incomplete line)

I agree your version is clearer and it is marginally (~1%) faster

The check means that we get the same delta whichever way round the lines
are compared. I think I added this because without it the highlighting
gets broken if there is increase in indentation followed by an identical
decrease on the next line.

As you say it's keeping the code the same, also while it does not matter
to the caller at the moment I was wary of potentially changing the sign
of the return value.

I'm not sure what you mean, we cover all the existing
color_moved_ws_handling values, I added the BUG() call to pick up future
omissions if another mode is added. (If we go for a single mode none of
this matters)

That makes sense, I'll fix it.

Exactly

That's a good idea, thanks

Yes, the block in the test starts with an empty line

> How do we handle multiple adjacent empty lines?

We group them all with the moved lines. This is slightly different to
--ignore-blank-lines which has a threshold on how may blank lines it
will ignore.

I would probably be best, picking up changes to the behavior of unusual
corner cases is best done with a test.

It's been really useful, thank for taking the time to look through the
patch so carefully.
