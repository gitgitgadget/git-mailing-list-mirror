This looks nicely done overall, and I appreciate the perf test.

The speed looks like a reasonable outcome. I'm torn on the qsort_r()
demo patch. I don't think it looks too bad. OTOH, I don't think I would
want to deal with the opposite-argument-order versions.

Is there any interest in people adding the ISO qsort_s() to their libc
implementations? It seems like it's been a fair number of years by now.
