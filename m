UPDATE for V2: We now know the full repro, and a test is added. Thanks
Szeder and Peff for your insights!

While dogfooding, Johannes found a bug in the fetch.writeCommitGraph config
behavior. While his example initially happened during a clone with
--recurse-submodules, (UPDATE) and the submodule is important, but
--recurse-submodules is not:

$ git clone <url> test
$ cd test
$ git -c fetch.writeCommitGraph=true fetch origin
Computing commit graph generation numbers: 100% (12/12), done.
BUG: commit-graph.c:886: missing parent <hash1> for commit <hash2>
Aborted (core dumped)

In the repo I had cloned, there were really 60 commits to scan, but only 12
were in the list to write when calling compute_generation_numbers(). A
commit in the list expects to see a parent, but that parent is not in the
list. The simple example I used for my testing was 
https://github.com/derrickstolee/numbers. Thie repo HAS A SUBMODULE, I just
forgot. Sorry for derailing the investigation somewhat.

The details above are the start of the commit message for [PATCH 1/2],
including a test that fails when fetching after cloning a repo with a
submodule.

In [PATCH 2/2], I actually have the fix. I tried to include as much detail
as I could for how I investigated the problem and why I think this is the
right solution. I added details that have come from the on-list discussion,
including what the submodule code is doing and why REACHABLE is no longer
used in commit-reach.c.

Thanks, -Stolee
