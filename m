Oh, I see. *ponder* maybe, though you could say that about any option=20
in the .git/config file, right?

I'm not sure of the use case of the command line option. In which case=20
would you want to only use the mailmap for that one command? It=20
doesn't normally affect your git commands, so it doesn't hurt to just=20
set the log.mailmap option. The environment use case would be just=20
like setting it in your ~/.gitconfig, other than you can have a=20
different one for each console, I guess.

Now, if we extended the mailmap feature even further, to report the=20
mappings from the rev-list code ((optional of course)), so that any=20
log viewer would show the mapped information; _then_ I would consider=20
the command-line and environment variables as mandatory. Since, then=20
you might want the feature off by default, and only use the mappings=20
when you need to figure out a breakage, thus need a quick way to=20
enable it.

So, unless anyone raises their hand that they need=20
command-line/environment ways of setting the mailmap file used, I'll=20
leave it as is for now. Ok?
