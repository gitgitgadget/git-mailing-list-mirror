As a Gerrit maintainer, I would suspect that we would 
welcome a way to track "changes" natively in git.  Despite 
any compatibility issues with the current Gerrit 
implementation, I suspect we would be open to new forms if 
the git community has a better proposal than the current 
Change-Id.  Especially if it does reduce the significant 
user pain point of installing a hook!
