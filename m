Great...of course _I_ know all the things in guilt that _I_ would like to
see changed (the maintainer syndrome?). :)

The git mailing list is interesting because it tends to have people from all
the other projects as well.  From the looks of things, Guilt seems to have a
pretty strong following the Linux filesystem area.

If things go well, I'll be able to go to OLS and have a BoF session about
Guilt (already got an Ok from the conference folks, it's just a matter of
figuring out travel/hotel).

Overall, sounds like a plan.
