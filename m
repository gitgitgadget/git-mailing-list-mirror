agree on that, which is why I have to admit I couldn't find the right
wording for the previous paragraph, and also why I didn't pinpoint a
specific commit as the one that introduced a bug.

it was instead just meant to describe a "current state of affairs" and
I was hoping the documentation entry will help guide future users to be
more careful with this file.

I think that is a matter of semantics, because for some users it seems
like a regression on the last bugfix and therefore might be used (albeit
IMHO incorrectly) as an excuse not to upgrade, which will be even worst.

so yes, I am implementint this "feature" to prevent them to have an
excuse but it also means we would most likely need to fastrack this
into maint.

I know, but commiting a line with 1 tab and 4 empty spaces instead of
using Q seemed even worst and q_to_cr almost fits the bill and might
even make this test "windows compatible" for once ;)

will rewrite then using test_write_lines and I hope it is still as
readable without having to resort to the originl ugly chain of echo
