Contributions from pine users are very much appreciated.  Among
the patches I either receive or pick up from the list, 15-20%
have WS corruption one way or another, which is starting to
annoy me.  What annoys me more are MIME quoted printable,
though, but that is partly my fault.

I haven't counted what percentage of those WS corrupted ones are
from Pine, so please do not take the above 15-20% number to have
anything to do with Pine.
