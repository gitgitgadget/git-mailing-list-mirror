Hi!

Dear diary, on Tue, Oct 17, 2006 at 01:45:34AM CEST, I got a letter
where Johannes Schindelin <Johannes.Schindelin@gmx.de> said that...

I think Aaron rather meant that in case of an error, the error messages
may seem incoherent from the perspective of a porcelain user if it's
been generated by the plumbing. And I had that problem in Cogito as well
few times in the past, but I think most of those are reasonable now (I
can't think of a counter-example off the top of my head).

Calling multiple git commands _is_ a problem, especially in a loop, but
I think it's more the inherent fork()+execve() overhead than whatever
happens over and over when main() takes over. Many git commands got
adjusted so that you can call them just once and then feed from/to them
over longer time period.
