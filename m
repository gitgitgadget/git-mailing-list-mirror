Thanks for the pointer!

Interesting.  I came to this issue because the test failed here due to
the echo.  So apparently the re-run under bash didn't happen here for
some reason or bash's echo behaved differently?  I need to dig into it
again to find what's going on.

Sure.  I understand the point.  I just had an impression that the test
is running under POSIX sh (/bin/sh), not bash, because it failed here
(see above).

OTOH, it seems that the fix is maybe not needed because it is solving a
non-problem.


Thank you.
