Yes

It is not our job to explain what POSIX character maps are.  The takeaway is 
they are unsupported; if you do not know what they are, why should you bother?

I am sorry, as a UNIX user I have no idea what iconv, being part of the GNU C 
library, means and how it works on a non-UNIX system that does not contain 
one.  If you know, could you enlighten us please?

I shall revert it after we have come to an agreement about the POSIX stuff.
