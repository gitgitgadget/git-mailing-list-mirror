Hey all,

I have been talked into helping write a real, paper-based book on Git
for a publisher big enough that you may even see it in your local
Borders or whatnot.  (And, it appears that Junio has been as well:
http://gitster.livejournal.com/21616.html)

So, since I'm near the beginning of this process, I was wondering if
the group had any feedback as to what might be super helpful to
include.  I mean, I have a pretty good layout and all, but if you
wanted to point me to some threads that tend to crop up in the mailing
list and IRC channel from relative newcomers that I might be able to
nip in the bud, I would like to.  I'm addressing the stuff that _I_
hear a lot, and I'm scanning the IRC logs and list for topics, but I
figured many of you must answer the same questions all the time, too.

Thanks,
Scott
