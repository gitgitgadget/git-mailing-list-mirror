I have a similar problem on my platform, with a different solution. My builds involve GCC binaries, NonStop L-series binaries (x86), and a NonStop J-series binaries (itanium). To keep me sane, I have all build targets going to separate directories, like Build/GCC, Build/Lbin, Build/Jbin away from the sources. This allows me to ignore Build/ regardless of extension and also to build different targets without link collisions. This is similar to how Java works (a.k.a. bin/). Much more workable, IMHO, than trying to manage individual binaries name by name or even by extension. I also have a mix of jpg and UTF-16 HTML that would end up in false-positives on a pure binary match and I do want to manage those.

What helps me is that I do most of my work in ECLIPSE, so derived resources (objects, generated sources) get auto-ignored by EGit, if you can make your compiler arrange that - but that's an ECLIPSE thing not a file system thing.

Cheers,
Randall
