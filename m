Thanks for the pointer. I mostly cargo-culted the test from the rest of
that script, so I didn't think too hard about race conditions. I think
the key difference is that the other tests are _actually_ using
--renormalize, which is going to re-hash the files and notice the line
ending change. And my test is not, so it will sometimes notice and
sometimes not.

It seems like we could probably solve it through some clever tweaking of
mtimes to make sure we have a consistent timestamp setup, but it's
resisting my quick efforts. I'm at an airport traveling right now, so I
may not get to it for a day or three.
