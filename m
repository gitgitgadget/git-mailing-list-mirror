Doing it as a percentage is kind of odd; it demonstrates that using 
version control is decreasing in popularity as more and more people who 
don't use version control submit votes. All of the version control systems 
show an upward trend in number of users, but most of them are not growing 
as much as the market is shrinking. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to 
be a way to get the people who use each of them as a percentage of people 
who use any of them, which is what you want for "market share".
