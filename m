My hunch is that our heuristic to fall back to the commits 'date'
value is saving us here. commit_gen_cmp() first compares the generation
numbers, breaking ties by 'date' as a heuristic. But since all
generation number queries return GENERATION_NUMBER_INFINITY during
writing, we're relying on our heuristic entirely.

I haven't looked much further than that, other than to see that I could
get about a ~4sec speed-up with this patch as compared to v2.29.1 in the
computing Bloom filters region on the kernel.

Assuming that we are in fact being saved by the "date" heuristic, I'd
probably write the following commit message instead:

  Before computing Bloom filters, the commit-graph machinery uses
  commit_gen_cmp to sort commits by generation order for improved diff
  performance. 3d11275505 (commit-graph: examine commits by generation
  number, 2020-03-30) claims that this sort can reduce the time spent to
  compute Bloom filters by nearly half.

  But since c49c82aa4c (commit: move members graph_pos, generation to a
  slab, 2020-06-17), this optimization is broken, since asking for
  'commit_graph_generation()' directly returns GENERATION_NUMBER_INFINITY
  while writing.

  Not all hope is lost, though: 'commit_graph_generation()' falls
  back to comparing commits by their date when they have equal generation
  number, and so since c49c82aa4c is purely a date comparison function.
  This heuristic is good enough that we don't seem to loose appreciable
  performance while computing Bloom filters. [Benchmark that we loose
  about ~4sec before/after c49c82aa4c9...]

  So, avoid the uesless 'commit_graph_generation()' while writing by
  instead accessing the slab directly. This returns the newly-computed
  generation numbers, and allows us to avoid the heuristic by directly
  comparing generation numbers.

Thanks,
Taylor
