I wondered if there might be some platforms that tweak the test
environment in such a way that we skip the space in "trash directory".
But looking at test-lib.sh, I don't think there is any easy way to do so
(e.g., you can't just set $TEST_DIRECTORY_NAME or something). So this
does seem safe, and it's nice to reduce unnecessary complexity.
