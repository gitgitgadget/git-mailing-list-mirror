Yeah, I think this is really a special case, just because we're not
testing specific items, but rather sanity-checking the TAP output
itself.

I think even in the unit tests, we're mostly carrying expected output
next to the code (and the unit test harness is checking those and
producing appropriate messages). It's only this "run a bunch of tests
that might themselves fail and see if the output was sensible" that it's
hard to do this for. I.e., t0080 is special and weird.

Yeah, I think it is mostly a lost cause here. We are far away from the
source code whether it is a here-doc or a separate file.

I guess I was responding more to the principle that external files are
usually just distracting and annoying (another annoyance: they inhibit
tab completion ;) ). But it is not that big a deal either way in this
case.

Yup, agreed with everything there.
