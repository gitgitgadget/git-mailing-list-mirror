This is not an issue introduced with this patch, however. The worktree
is not initialized atomically. First the worktree directory is created
and then it is populated with content including the commondir reference.

Because there is no big repository lock that everyone takes to access
a repository other running git processes can see the wotktree without
the commondir file. 

The way this is mitigated in users of get_worktrees() is an assumption
that the first worktree is the main worktree.

If this is sufficient is not something this patchset aims to address.
It merely addresses get_worktrees() aborting due to hitting specific
stage in the initialization of a worktree.

Thanks

Michal
