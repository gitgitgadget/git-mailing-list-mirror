I apologize, however my intent in reaching out was not to seek free of cost help desk services.  After speaking with Apple they suggested that I contact both Git and Code developers for feedback on the commands I used prior to the potential file removal.  

I appreciate your assistance thus far and will reach out to the mailing list as you've described below.  Again thank you for your time and have a good day.

Hi Tori,

please reply-to-all. I really have no time to serve as your personal,
free-of-cost help desk. But I am willing to help on the mailing list.

Were your files inside the .app, or did you store them in your Documents/
folder?
