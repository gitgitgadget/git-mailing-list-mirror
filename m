Oh, you're right. Somewhere between the screen and my brain the "&&"
became an "||".

I agree that works, and has the advantage that the arguments are treated
symmetrically. We _might_ say "test failure" instead of "bug in test"
when the expectation is empty and the generated output is not (because
we do not know which is which), but I think that would be uncommon (and
the most important thing is that we do not silently consider it a pass).

I'd be OK pursuing either this line, or what you showed originally.
