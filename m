BTW in mod_perl cache validation is as simple as using meets_condition()
method on request object after we send at least one of validator
headers (Last-Modified:, ETag:)... but this would mean that cache
validation would be available only when under mod_perl...

  "Re: kernel.org mirroring (Re: [GIT PULL] MMC update)"
  http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/33604
thread Apache mod_cache doesn't bring much. Perhaps because of the above...
although adding artificial expires header seems a bit like a hack.

  # require explicit support from the UA if we are to send the page as

  # we have to do this because MSIE sometimes globs '*/*', pretending to

This was added by Alp Toker <alp@atoker.com> in f6801d669ee11:
  "gitweb: Send XHTML as 'application/xhtml+xml' where possible"
