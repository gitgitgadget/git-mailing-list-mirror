And most importantly, we never err on the side of complaining
unnecessarily. So our safety might not kick in, but as long as it kicks
in most of the time, we're fine.

I like this approach much better than the previous round.

These embedded double-quotes are unnecessary, I think, because it's a
variable assignment: E.g.:

  set -- one two 'foo bar'
  eval "last_arg=\${$#}"
  echo $last_arg

should produce "foo bar".

Usually not a big deal, but because of the extra quoting it may make the
whole thing a bit more readable to drop them.
