If you run "git status" it will list the files that have conflicts as 
"unmerged". To prevent "git commit" from creating a commit that contains 
conflict markers you can use a pre-commit hook that runs "git diff 
--cached--check". The sample hook that is created by default does this, 
to activate it run

	mv .git/hooks/pre-commit.sample .git/hooks/pre-commit

in the main worktree. You can also run "git config commit.verbose true" 
to make "git commit" show the diff of the changes that will be committed 
below the commit message when you're editing the message.

Best Wishes

Phillip
