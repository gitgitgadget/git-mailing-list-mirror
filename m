Is it explicit kill, or implicit kill: close pipe and end process?

I'm rather partial to "abort" instead of "error-all", or "quit"/"exit"
(but I prefer "abort" or "bail-out"), as it better reflects what this
response is about - ending filter process.

I guess the idea is that single filter can be run on different types
of blobs, and it could fail on some types (some files) and not others.
Like LFS-type filter failing on files with size larger than 2 GiB,
or iconv-like filter to convert UTF-16 to UTF-8 failing on invalid
byte sequences.

I think the idea was for Git to request shutdown, and filter to tell
when it finished (or just exiting, and Git getting SIGCHLD, I guess).
It is hard to tell how much to wait, for example for filter process
to send "sync" command, or finish unmounting, or something...

Isn't it the same problem with v1 filters being killed on Git process
exit?  Unless v2 filter wants to do something _after_ writing output
to Git, it should be safe... unless Git process is killed, but it
is not different from filter being stray-killed.

Errr... if it were any v1 filter, it would be useless (as bad or
worse performance than ordinary v1 clean or smudge filter).  It
might make sense if v1 filter and v2 wrapper were written in the
same [dynamic] language, and wrapper could just load / require
filter as a function / procedure, [compile it], and use it.
For example smudge/clean filter in Perl (e.g. rot13), and v2 wrapper
in Perl too.

Best,
