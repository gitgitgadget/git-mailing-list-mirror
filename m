It doesn't relate to the vuln fix -- the relevant change was earlier.  I 
was upgrading from a rather old version of git.  Apparently file name 
encoding was different then.  The fix is to check out the files again, 
which will pick up their new encoding.  One can't specify the exact 
filenames in the git checkout -- command, but one can construct a wildcard 
that will pick out just those files, if needed to avoid checking out others.

I should clarify that I was offering to go file a bug against git, not 
msysgit.  But since this was an easy to fix side-effect of upgrading from 
an old git, that's likely not needed.  And the answer would have been...

:-)  Oh, yes -- next up is checking the encoding of those file names...but 
they're likely ok in the repo, and it's only the checked-out names 
generated by the old git that were non-standard.
