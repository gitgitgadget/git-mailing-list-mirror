I think the assumption made was that you were already getting some work
done with the version of git that you had.

If you do not yet have a comfortable grasp of git usage I would suggest
the following steps:

    1) Grab "a" version of git (preferably latest stable version)
	-If you need to compile it, read the "INSTALL" file.
    2) Read intro/tutorials
	-tutorial.txt
	-everyday.txt
	-user-manual.txt (more in-depth)
	These three are mentioned in the git man page.
    3) Start using it
	-refer to man pages to answer questions as you
	 encounter issues
	-ask the mailing list when man pages or other docs
	 are unable to answer your questions
    4) End of story

Upgrading, reading RelNotes, using new features, and reading the high-volume
mailing list are not required, so it is wrong to suggest that they are barriers
to entry for using git.
