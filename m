OK about that. I was thinking to remove the {}, and the we -need- the ";"

Does it make sense to add it as a comment ?
I know, everything is documented otherwise, but when looking at the source
 code only, the context may be useful, it may be not.

Sorry, my wrong - reset is a bad word here.
"Git will not use the capability for the active session" is perfect!

Git and the filter are in a negotiation phase to find out which side is able
to do what.So I don't think there is a "problem" (in the sense that I understand
it) at all.

And back to the "abort":
I still think that the word feels to harsh...
"abort" in my understanding smells too much "a program is terminated".
If it is not too late, does it may sense to use something like "nack" ?

May be I misunderstood the whole sequence, and abort is the right thing.
If yes, how about this ?

	} else if (!strcmp(filter_status->buf, "abort") && wanted_capability) {
		/*
		 * Don't try to filter files with this capability for lifetime
		 * of the current Git process.
		 */
		 entry->supported_capabilities &= ~wanted_capability;
