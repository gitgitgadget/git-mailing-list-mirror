How do diffing Ã  la 'git diff' JPEGs or AVIs make sense?

Also, you certainly have little to delta against as you add new photos 
more often than modifying existing ones?

Right.  And my proposal fits that scenario pretty well.

Right now git simply do much worse.  So doing as well is still a worthy 
goal.

I still can't see how diffing big files is useful.  Certainly you'll 
need a specialized external diff tool, in which case it is not git's 
problem anymore except for writing content to temporary files.

Rename detection: either you deal with the big files each time, or you 
(re)create a cache with that information so no analysis is needed the 
second time around.  This is something that even small files might 
possibly benefit from.  But in any case, there is no other ways but to 
bite the bullet at least initially, and big files will be slower to 
process no matter what.

Looks to me like you wish for git to do what a specialized database 
would be much more suited for the task.  Isn't there tools to gather 
picture metadata info, just like itunes does with MP3s already?

Sure.

But being able to deal with large (1GB and more) files remains a totally 
different problem.
