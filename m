It is the interoperability with existing Git LFS repositories that my community is requesting, not specifically any file size issues. Some want the locking function. The API looks fairly straight forward and I suspect a complete reimplementation will take less of my time than trying to get GO to actually run on the platform. Cross-compilation might be an option, but that's likely a tricky proposition that has not worked in the past - the issue there is that cross compilation requires Windows and Cygwin, which make configure rather confused and so far, not workable. Neither GCC nor GNULIB build completely in port attempts. So the answer is "NO". â˜¹
