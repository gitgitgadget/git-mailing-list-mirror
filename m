Ah, I didn't realize we actually documented that. And perhaps it is more
consistent, too: you'd get different results from running "ls-remote"
outside a repository versus one that just doesn't have the objects from
the other side.

Yeah, that probably would be a better place. Though your response also
has made me think that maybe just sticking with the "missing object"
response is reasonable. I don't have a strong opinion between the two.
