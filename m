The RFC for URLs (which we don't actually follow particularly much) 
doesn't permit whitespace. Protocols that use URLs directly generally use 
newlines as control characters. For example, an HTTP request for:

http://host/path/with
newline/in/it

would parse as a request for "http://host/path/with" with an invalid 
header line. Normally, to refer to a resource whose name contains a 
newline, the URL contains "%0A" instead.

Of course, our "url" config can contain some things that aren't URLs, but 
this particular case was of the form that's supposed to be a standard URL.
