Thanks for sharing these; it's nice if we can avoid duplicating work.
We'll see if somebody at the event wants to pick up this topic.

Hmm. I think the current behavior is actually buggy. I assume the
documentation you mean is from git.txt:

  --paginate::
          Pipe all output into 'less' (or if set, $PAGER) if standard
          output is a terminal.  This overrides the `pager.<cmd>`
          configuration options (see the "Configuration Mechanism" section
          below).

That comes from 06300d9753 (git.1: Clarify the behavior of the
--paginate option, 2010-02-14). But I think that commit was just trying
to clarify that "--paginate" overrides the defaults and config, but not
does say "always paginate".

I suspect nobody really noticed it in practice because once you've
configured "pager.foo", there's basically no need to ever use
"--paginate".

I think I'm suggesting (2), then.
