I'm very sorry for causing you (and possibly other people) waste of your time.
I have surely understimate my ignorance in scons.

Not being an expert, I'am trying to get some help from scons people to find 
a fix/solution as soon as possible.

In any case I am sure the fault is mine, not of the tool, that is very good
to keep the build system overhead very low.

Of course, if someone can give my some good advice/patch to fix my Makefile or to document the
prerequisites better it will be very appreciated.

Marco

P.S: I cannot be on-line all day long, so sorry for the delaying of the answers.
I try to answer to all the e-mails as soon as I can.
