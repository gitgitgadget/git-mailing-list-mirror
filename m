Dear Git community members,

codeBeamer 5.6, the latest version of our ALM platform supporting Git, is available for free download.

The most interesting change for the Git community is that it fully supports Smart HTTP access. When interviewing
our clients planning to adopt or piloting with Git, they consistently mention their difficulties with SSH.
(Authentication is key when using Distributed Version Control in enterprise environment.) While the SSH approach is
highly secure and encrypted, it makes a little cumbersome for new users to adopt Git, because they are required to
generate and upload SSH public keys. Now, this is possible to authenticate over the HTTP(S) protocol using Git Smart HTTP.
