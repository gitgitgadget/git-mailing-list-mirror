I remember a discussion about whether that list and its archive should
be open or closed, and I agree that offering choices is good.
However, since that mentoring list requires registration, we have to
carefully consider how to present it to newcomers.

Openly accessible knowledge is a fundamental value, and it's the
foundation of open source.  Therefore, we definitely should not direct
newcomers to a closed mailing list as the first option, it can only be
a fallback.

The text should list git@vger as the first option, since that's the
only open mailing list we have, it should clearly emphasize that
newcomers are very welcome, and should explicitly encourage them to
post their questions here, no matter how trivial or silly they think
those questions are, we'll be always glad to answer them.

The closed mailing list can be mentioned third as a fallback for those
who would prefer not to end up on public record right away or who have
any technical issues with posting to the main mailing list.
