lots of misinformation in here (including the implication that gittorrent 
is ready, or nearly ready to use).

Political and Technical Implications of GitTorrent
Posted by CmdrTaco on Thursday December 04, @01:03PM

Programming Media
lkcl writes "The GitTorrent Protocol (GTP) is a protocol for collaborative 
git repository distribution across the Internet. Git promises to be a 
distributed software management tool, where a repository can be 
distributed. Yet, the mechanisms used to date to actually 'distribute,' 
such as ssh, are very much still centralized. GitTorrent makes Git truly 
distributed. The initial plans are for reducing mirror loading, however 
the full plans include totally distributed development: no central mirrors 
whatsoever. PGP signing (an existing feature of git) and other 
web-of-trust-based mechanisms will take over from protocols on ports (e.g. 
ssh) as the access control 'clearing house.' The implications of a truly 
distributed revision control system are truly staggering: unrestricted 
software freedom. The playing field is leveled in so many ways, as 'The 
Web Site' no longer becomes the central choke-point of control. Coming 
just in time for that all-encompassing Free Software revolution hinted at 
by The Rebellion Against Vista, this article will explain more fully some 
of the implications that make this quiet and technically brilliant 
project, GitTorrent, so important to Software Freedom, from both technical 
and political perspectives."
