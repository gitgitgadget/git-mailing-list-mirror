I think you are making the wrong assumption here.

someone may use CVS becouse they contribute to a project that is only 
availabe via CVS

someone may use Perforce becouse that is the VCS that their company uses

if you do commercial development with windows you are almsot going to be 
required to use MS VSS.

you are looking at it from the point of view of 'which VCS would you 
select for a new project', but that would be a very different question.

I find it interesting that the number of people who use git and the other 
DVCS systems in so small. Is this becouse the 'market share' of those 
other systems is small? or becouse people who learn git aren't willing to 
put up with other systems (or vice-versa)? or is there some other trend 
or tendancy that makes people who select one DVCS more likely to work on 
similar projects, so people interested in those types of projects will 
generally just see a single DVCS system
