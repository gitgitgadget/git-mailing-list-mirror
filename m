Hi Martin,

The "bar" commit was present in the test I based mine on, where it was 
equally unnecessary except possibly for making the test easier to 
understand. I have no feelings whether it is better to have it in or 
leave it out, other than that it should be consistent across tests.

Not messing up the master branch is what multiple tests in this file, 
specifically the test I based mine on, do. If the test I had based mine 
on and my test had both done

   echo aaa >bar &&
   git add bar &&
   git commit -m bar_commit

on the master branch, whichever test appeared second would fail, because 
git commit would not detect any modifications. This seems needlessly 
fragile to me, so I agree with the pattern used by the existing tests.

Yeah, the test set up is literally a copy of the test immediately above, 
except modified not to use conflicting ref names.

It could be simplified, but in that case, the other tests should be 
simplified the same way, and I did not think it was appropriate to make 
such changes here.

Cheers,
