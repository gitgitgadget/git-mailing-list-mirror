Right. It is worth mentioning here (as you do below) that this was fixed
as of 9a7a9ed10d (bloom: use provided 'struct bloom_filter_settings',
2020-09-16).

Thanks for the test! That saved me a little bit of work trying to set up
the scenario you're describing in a reproducible way. I think that the
third test can be fixed relatively easily. The crux of the issue there
is that we are computing Bloom filters for commits, some of which
already had Bloom filters computed in an earlier layer, but with
different settings than the one that we're using to write the current
layer.

So, we need to be more aggressively checking the Bloom filter settings
in any layer we want to reuse a Bloom filter out of before reusing it
verbatim in the current layer. The patch below the scissors line is
sufficient to do that, and it causes the third test to start passing.

...But, teaching the revision machinery how to handle a walk through
commits in multiple commit-graph layers with incompatible Bloom filter
settings is trickier. Right now we compute all of the Bloom keys up
front using the Bloom filter settings in the top layer. I think we'd
probably want to change this to lazily compute those keys by:

  - Keeping around the contents of the Bloom keys, i.e., the pathspecs
    themselves.

  - Keeping a hashmap from Bloom filter settings to computed Bloom keys
    corresponding to those settings.

  - Lazily filling in that hashmap as we traverse through different
    commits.

At least, that's the best way that I can think to do it. It does get
kind of slow, though; we'd have to scan every commit graph layer at each
commit in the worst case to find the actual 'struct commit_graph *' in
order to get its Bloom filter settings. So, I think that's sort of
show-stoppingly slow, and that we should probably think more deeply
about it before taking up that direction.

Maybe Stolee has some better thoughts about how we can quickly go from a
commit to either (a) the commit-graph struct that that commit is stored
in, or (b) the Bloom filter settings belonging to that struct.

Thanks,
Taylor
