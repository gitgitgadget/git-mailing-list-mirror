Yes, and here is my answer. (I had to discuss a little with my wife so =
took=20
me some time to come up with it.)

Yes, definitely.

Yes or to San Fransisco. I will probably stay 3 or 4 days even if I don=
't=20
attend any other conference/event. Any free accomodation would be great=
ly=20
appreciated.

(Flight costs from Paris France are about 550 EUR (825 US$) for Portlan=

Oregon around the 20th of September and 630-670 EUR (950-1000 US$) for =
San=20
=46ransisco around the 27th of October. Flights takes between 13 and 23=

each as they are not direct.)

Oct 08 is ok. After that I would prefer between May 09 and Oct 09.
Anyway not Nov 08 or Dec 08.

I'd like small sessions (half a day/night long) that go like this:

- 1 hour long presentation and discussion: someone talks about a topic =
and=20
some problems about it, then we discuss what could be done about this t=
opic
- a few hours long hacking: we try to implement solutions for problems=20
related to the previous discussion.

But I guess anything will do.

> 	5: Would you volunteer to help organize it?

Yes. Though I am probably not in the best place to help. But I can star=
t to=20
gather some information on a web page on the wiki or something.

Thanks,
Christian.
