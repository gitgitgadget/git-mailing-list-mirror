In git terms, this is called "history rewriting".  And you really don't 
want to do that if your repository is pulled by other people, unless 
there is an explicit statement about that fact.

Still, if you fetch all branches from the remote (which is the default 
behavior anyway), then the branch you're interested in will always 
contain the particular commit you're looking for, regardless of the name 
of the branch.  While it is true that branches may not be immutable, any 
commit they collectively refer to still are immutable.

If the remote has deleted the only branch through which your particular 
commit of interest was reachable, then of course pulling all branches 
from the remote won't hhelp you.  But nor would a fetch with the 
particular commit's SHA1 because it may well have been pruned from the 
remote repository at that point.

Thing is, with the distributed nature of git, nothing prevents you from 
keeping a local version of the commit you're interested in.  Unlike with 
a central repository where someone else might delete a branch you need, 
with git you will still have access to that particular commit locally 
regardless if the remote repository has deleted it or not.

There is nothing a tool can do for you if someone is determined to be 
stupid with it.  In other words, don't delete a branch if it contains 
important stuff.  You may rename it if you wish.  And if you don't want 
to fetch everything then you may always find out about the right branch 
to pull with "git branch --contains <SHA1>".

Maybe.  But as others already explained, there are technical reasons 
that makes such a solution undesirable.
