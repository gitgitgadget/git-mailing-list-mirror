From a brief look, I think it is that your branch is based on v2.42.0,
which does not contain 0763c3a2c4 (http: update curl http/2 info
matching for curl 8.3.0, 2023-09-15). And the macos CI image has since
been updated to a more recent version of curl.

So yeah, not anything to worry about for your series.
