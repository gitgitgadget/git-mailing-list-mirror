It certainly looks better to me. It also makes sense to me to validate
the options before forking/logging, though I suppose one could argue the
opposite.

I wonder why we didn't do it this way in the beginning (i.e., why the
tee bits were all handled separately before the parsing phase). I guess
just because we have to pass the options down to the sub-process.

OK, so this is set for the unstuck options, which then pick up the
option in the next loop iteration. That's perhaps less gross than my
"re-build the options with set --" trick.

A simple variable set is enough for "-r". In theory we could make this:

  if test -n "$handle_unstuck_arg"
  then
	eval "$handle_unstuck_arg \$1"
  fi
  ...

  -r)
	handle_unstuck_arg=handle_opt_r ;;

and handle_opt_r() could do whatever it wants. But I don't really
foresee us adding a lot of new options (in fact, given that this is just
the internal tests, I am tempted to say that we should just make it
"-r<arg>" for the sake of simplicity and consistency. But maybe somebody
would be annoyed. I have never used "-r" ever myself).
