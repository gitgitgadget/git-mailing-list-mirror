Well, that was my tongue-in-cheek bit.  My intent was to just say "Why
not simply use scp/rcp/rsync, whatever?", as that seemed to be what
you were asking git to do.  But, if you had to do it, I thought you
could, using the aliases I outlined (and, as it turns out, I may have
even been wrong about that).
