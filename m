>From the #irker channel on freenode:

[14:52]	TkTech	esr: Oh, and I was talking to scanlime earlier since the "Ilkotech" kids messed up again. She'll be putting up a landing page on her server listing alternatives, I gave her irker, kgb, and mine.
[14:52]	esr	"The Ilkotech kids messed up gain"? What'd they do? And what'd they do the last time?
[14:53]	TkTech	They haven't paid their hosting bills so their host is down, not that they've done anything.
[14:53]	TkTech	I talked to them and they had about 10 minutes of interest in keeping cia.vc alive, then moved on.

CIA is dead beyond recall. I wrote the code in contrib/ciabot/ and I
think it should be removed.  Sometime soon I'll ship another patch
deleting it.

The most foolish mistake we could possibly make would be to permit 
the conquered Eastern peoples to have arms.  History teaches that all 
conquerors who have allowed their subject races to carry arms have 
prepared their own downfall by doing so.
