hi,

I am Saurabh Jain, 3rd year Computer Science and Engineering student
studying at Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee. I am quite fluent with
C programming.

I would like to apply for GSoC 2016 under Git in libgit2. I read the list of
possible projects and microprojects to be done. 
I tried to fix this, "Fix the examples/diff.c implementation of the -B"
given in Starter Projects, I made some changes to the code and created a
Issue on the libgit2's Github repository. But no one seems to reply to that,
also the IRC channel for libgit2 seems to be inactive. Please someone
concerned have a look.

<https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/issues/3686>

I would also like to know who will be going to mentor GSoC 2016, libgit2
projects so that I would be able to discuss my ideas with them.

All the concerned Mentors you can drop me a mail at saurabhsuniljain@gmail.com

Hoping for a positive response from your side.

Have a nice day !
