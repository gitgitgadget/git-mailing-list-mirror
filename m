The Git Merge Contributor Summit is a little over a week away. If you're
interested in coming but haven't signed up, please do! We have a few
spaces available still. Details are in the previous announcement:

  http://public-inbox.org/git/20181206094805.GA1398@sigill.intra.peff.net/

There's no set agenda; we'll decide what to discuss that day. But if
anybody would like to mention topics they are interested in (whether you
want to present on them, or just have an open discussion), please do so
here. A little advance notice can help people prepare more for the
discussions.

Even if you're not coming, please feel free to suggest topics (but bonus
points if you convince somebody who _is_ coming to lead the session).

If you're not coming, you can probably stop reading this message now.
The rest is all logistics.

We have the room available from 9am-5pm. Breakfast will be served from
9am-10am in the main area (i.e., mingling with workshop attendees and
other such ruffians). So I'd suggest to show up around 9am to get
registered and mingle, and then we can start the Very Serious Business
at 10am.

Lunch will be provided at noon, and some snacks in the afternoon.
There's no organized dinner. However, there will be a social/drinks
event for the broader conference at 7pm; I'll provide more details that
day.

For people who want to try to join remotely, I don't think we're going
to have a particularly fancy AV setup. But there should at least be a
big screen (which we typically do not really use for presenting), and I
hope we can provide some connectivity. I'll be visiting the venue the
day before (Jan 30th) in the late afternoon (Brussels time) and I'll try
to do a test run. If anybody wants to volunteer to be the guinea pig on
the other end of the line, I'd welcome it.

The physical setup this year will actually be 4 round tables, instead of
one giant table. I'm hoping this will facilitate breaking off into
sub-groups and having more intimate conversations, and maybe avoid the
"it's hard to hear people at the other end of the table" issues. Or
maybe it will just make it worse as we shout to each other from all four
tables. I can't wait to see!

If you have any other questions or ideas, please share them here (or
email me off-list if appropriate). I look forward to seeing people
there!
