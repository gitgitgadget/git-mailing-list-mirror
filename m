Rather sad given their user base.  gitk seems to have at least 30%
of the respondants while git-gui is somewhere between 10-14%,
depending upon the question asked.  Odd.  qgit has a smaller
respondant base (~7.7%) but is probably the tool that more Git
users would be comfortable hacking on since it is developed in C++.
