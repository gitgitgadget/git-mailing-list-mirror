Fair enough. It is a game of chicken, but it is one that is easy to win. :)

I almost suggested using "git.c" as the dummy file, since we know it
must compile anyway. But that probably has other problems (it's more
expensive, and if it _does_ have an error, the results may be
confusing).

It's a shame we can't just try to do the _real_ compiles using the
auto-dependency stuff, and then fall back if they fail. But I think
there's a chicken-and-egg problem there with "make" doing real work, and
figuring out the dependencies to do real work.

Hmm, my suggestion was off the cuff without digging to see whether we
used to do something similar. ;)

I do worry a bit that we'd be regressing the case that commit tried to
fix. OTOH, I'm not sure I understand its commit message. It talks about
things in CFLAGS being a problem, but it looks like the original (and my
proposal here) would not look at CFLAGS at all? If people are putting
stuff into CC that will break when used without CFLAGS, then I feel like
the answer might be "don't do that". Or are there common situations
where $(CC) is not expected to behave sensibly on its own?

I'm happy to submit that on top, or even turn the earlier hunk into a
patch.  But let's see what Ã†var has to say to what's been discussed so
far. I don't want to derail his effort.
