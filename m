Dear diary, on Mon, May 30, 2005 at 09:54:13AM CEST, I got a letter

Well, you definitively have a point. I just felt guilty that if I
would've spent ten seconds actually testing it, you wouldn't have to
spent ten minutes (or who knows how long) replying to my silly question.

I meant you all on the mailing list, not you specifically. English is
sometimes annoying. ;-) (And I was just trying to be funny, in my usual
awful way.)

> Always glad to be of help.

Thanks. :-)
