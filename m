Heh. This is all very reminiscent of an off-list discussion that I had
with Peff and Stolee before sending this upstream. Originally, I had
implemented this as:

  $ git commit-graph write --split --[no-]merge

but we decided that this '--merge' and '--no-merge' requiring '--split'
seemed to indicate that this was better off as an argument to '--split'.
Of course, there's no getting around that it is... odd to say
'--split=no-merge' for exactly the reason you suggest.

Here's another way of looking at it: the presence of '--split' means
"work with split graph files" and the '[no-]merge' argument means:
"always/never condense multiple layers".

For me, this not only makes the new option language jive, but makes it
clearer to me than the combination of '--split', '--split --no-merge'
and '--split --merge', where the third one is truly bizarre. At least
condensing the second '--' and making 'merge' an argument to 'split'
makes it clear that the two work together somehow.

If you have a different suggestion, I'd certainly love to hear about it
and discuss. But, at least as far as our internal discussions have gone,
this is by far the best option that we have been able to come up with.

1771be90c8 is right, and this documentation is wrong. Upon re-reading
it, I found the contents of this documentation between those two
parenthesis to be confusing rather than helpful. For that reason, I
simply removed it.

Heh. Exactly how we started these patches when I originally wrote

I think you're right. I changed it in my local v2.
