Actually I came across this error when testing the "context-sensitive
feed links" patch, and was hand-crafting (munging) gitweb URLs.

But after thinking about this bug a bit I have realized that this
situation _can_ happen with link generated by gitweb, only in very rare
cases.  It is enough if you use 'history' view link without $hash ('h')
parameter, and with transient $hash_base ('hb') parameter, i.e. either
name of branch, or "HEAD", or not set (implies "HEAD"), and happen into
situation where file was _deleted_ *between* gitweb link creation and
following (accessing) this link.  For example 'history' links in 'tree'
and 'commitdiff' views doesn't have 'h' parameter.  Also the 'history'
link in navigation bar wouldn't have 'h' parameter if 'blob' or 'tree'
view where it is in doesn't have it.
