Yay, Berlin!  I would be glad to join there; I would probably not have
the time and resources to travel to SF this year.

I was at the 2010 GitTogether in Mountain View.  I really liked the
unconference format, and the way Shawn and Junio used it: just using the
topic stickers as a sort of todo-list, not actually fixing any schedule
in advance.  Oddly enough we also managed to avoid the usual consequence
of open-ended discussions: getting stuck endlessly on an absolutely
insignificant point.

I think the discussions were very productive.  I would love to do more
hacking than we managed in 2010, but I realize that this is not possible
if we just meet for 2-3 days.  Perhaps one option would be to plan for
1-2 days of hacking after the discussion rounds, so that the interested
people can stay a bit longer?
