Usually you'd send it to the list, with the commit message in the body
and the patch inline below, as generated by "git format-patch".

Unfortunately gmail is notorious for corrupting whitespace in message
bodies. You can use git-send-email to send the mails (but you'll need to
configure your gmail smtp information; see the EXAMPLE section of "git
help send-email").

Alternatively, you can make a pull request to https://github.com/git/git
and then send it to the list via https://submitgit.herokuapp.com/.
