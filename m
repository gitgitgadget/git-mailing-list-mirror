That could be. I read Tao's explanation as meaning that people do this:

    git clone foo.git foo
    cd foo
    git worktree add bar
    git worktree add baz

rather than (perhaps) this:

    git clone foo.git foo
    cd foo
    git worktree add ../bar
    git worktree add ../baz

But it's possible I misunderstood.

My response was based upon my recollection of the periodic message
which shows up on the mailing list reporting a bug or submitting an
improvement for git-new-workdir, accompanied by a statement that
git-new-workdir is still a better fit for the user's particular
use-case. But I've never used it myself, so it's good to hear from
someone (you) who does use it.

Perhaps.
