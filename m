Just to chime in and support this behavior of the advice messages.  
Basically, you don't want to have them all disabled at the same time, 
but to have per-message enable/disable granularity.  I'd guess that some 
of the messages are quite usable even to highly experienced users, and 
encountering newly added messages is also very useful.  Thus, having 
them all disabled wouldn't be the best idea.
