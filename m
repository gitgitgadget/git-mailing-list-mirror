I believe what Jeff says is basically correct.  The "Git Project" will
be part of a non-profit in New York, and it's true that the Git Project
could be therefore be subject to the laws of New York.  However, it
isn't that much different of some Git developers being in New York and
being subject thereto.  Developers outside the USA continue to operate
as volunteers for the project and aren't impacted any more than they
already are participating in an unincorporated project.

Nevertheless, I'm going to check in with Conservancy's lawyers to verify
there are no serious disadvantages to Git joining a USA non-profit that
weren't already the case anyway since some developers are in the USA
anyway.  I'll respond back when I hear from them.
