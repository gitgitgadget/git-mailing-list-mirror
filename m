  by the way, I have read through the homepage again after some time and
tweaked the text a bit for clarity and perhaps grammar (hope I didn't
make it worse than it was). I have also reorganized the Related Tools
section and rewrote the initial paragraph.

  Design-wise, I have added some extra spacing at many places, turned
the Related Tools section to a 2x2 grid to take less vertical space and
redone the main headline.  Also, I tried to tweak the color scheme to
use brighter and less nauseating colors - please tell me what do you
think!

  I'm wondering whether perhaps the page is still too wide now - one
idea would be to move the header, the two link boxes and possibly some
of the contact information to a sidebar - the link boxes always looked a
bit strange to me. I'm not sure how much would it help, though.
