I think we're a little less extreme there than the kernel. Like I said,
my preference is to leave Git as-is, but if somebody feels strongly, I
don't think it would be that hard to leave core.gitproxy untouched here.

I agree it doesn't scale, but my suspicion is that we're talking about
an extremely small population here. IMHO we should be considering
deprecating git:// entirely (from Git itself, and kernel.org should
consider turning it off). In the v2 protocol, there's no advantage to
using it over HTTP.

I don't think it can be easily distinguished from an actual network
hangup (or proxy command failure, etc). I would much rather stop doing
the close() entirely than add any kind of heuristic retry.
