Right, but what's the advantage over passing the error struct as a 
function parameter? It feels like we're adding extra complexity and 
hiding the assignment to "e" to work around the inconvenience of 
returning a struct rather than a flag. Is there some other advantage to 
returning a struct that makes this worthwhile?
