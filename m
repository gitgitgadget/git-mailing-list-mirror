I always suspected this is just a wish, I had the implression that
the rpm-based distribution has diverged too much.

I often hear this, yet I see e.g. SuSE or Polish Linux creating spec
files very different from what is used in Fedora.

(I suppose you meant "rpmbuild -ta", that's the feature which takes
the spec file from the tarball.)

The value of this statement is limited by the fact that it's a fork
of Fedora.  What value does that spec file bring for Mandrake users,
for example?

Happy hacking,
