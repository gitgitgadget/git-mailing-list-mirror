I've got news for you. The UUIDs generated by uuidgen CAN collide:

    The new UUID can reasonably be considered unique
    among all UUIDs created on the local system, and
    among UUIDs created on other systems in the past
    and in the future.

You're creating a straw man argument; conceptually, what I propose is
better than what the current system provides because it would decrease
the rate at which identity entropy increases.

Go read the thread until you understand.
