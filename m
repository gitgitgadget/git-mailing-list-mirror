Did Google do two international tickets last year for Git?  Hmm,
don't go spreading that word around.  Very few groups got that
amount of travel money for the mentor summit.  Maybe none others.

IMHO, _if_ Git is accepted this year, and _if_ the mentor summit is
held this fall as it has been in the past, Google will most likely
cover only one ticket, especially if we actually also supported a
GitTogether immediately after.

I will ask.

Last year it was difficult on LH.  Despite the fact that most of
the attendees probably never even met her, she put a lot of work
into the GitTogether behind the scenes.  Without her efforts,
the GitTogether simply would not have happened here.

It was also *immediately* after the biggest event of the year
that she and her team run (GSoC mentor summit), and really close
to two other very big events that they run.  They were working
pretty much 7 days a week for over 3 months straight, and were
really looking forward to some time off when I threw GitTogether
'08 into their calendar.

I'm not sure I can ask LH to put her and her team through that again.
I want to continue living.  :-)

There is also the most popular issue of budgets.  GitTogether '08
wasn't free for us.  Its cheaper than anything we would get from a
conference venue/hotel outside the Googleplex, but it still was a
non-trivial sum.  We simply may not have the funds for it this year.
