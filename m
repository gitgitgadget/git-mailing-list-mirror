I don't think it could matter here, as these are meant to be smallish
strings, but I think we should get into the habit of using size_t
consistently to hold string lengths.

It makes auditing for integer overflow problems much simpler (this is on
my mind as I happen to be tracing some bugs around this the past few
days).

(There are a few instances in the next patch, too. Other than this nit,
though, your series looks good to me).
