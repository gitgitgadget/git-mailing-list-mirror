I disagree that it's a bad example. Just because a reader might not
realize that it is sometimes OK and sometimes not, does not make it bad
to do so in the OK case. It means the reader needs to understand the
rule in order to correctly apply it.

I am sympathetic to the auditing issue, though.

I dunno. In this case it is not too bad to do:

  git cat-file commit $commit >good-commit &&
  perl ... <good-commit >broken-commit

but I am not sure I am on board with a blanket rule of "git must never
be on the left-hand side of a pipe".

I don't think it is, but I could be wrong. POSIX does say that "\n"
matches a newline in the pattern space, but nothing about it on the RHS
of a substitution. I have a vague feeling of running into problems in
the past, but I could just be misremembering.

We also tried matching /^tree/ and using "a\" to append a line, but it
was both hard to read and hit portability issues with bsd sed.
