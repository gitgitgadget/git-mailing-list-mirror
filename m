I was thinking similar: The pain vc-annotate obviously should work without
those "-C" options, and with prefix argument (C-u <num> in Emacs) it could
start looking for copied stuff. HMO...

Worse than no progress reporting is the inability to kill the process (if you
run out of patience) with C-g (that stops most commands in Emacs).

I confess taht is still use RCS from time to time, and I prefer the
higher-level Emacs commands ;-)
