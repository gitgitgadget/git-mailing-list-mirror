This is a user error. core.ignorecase is *not* an instruction as in 
"hey, Git, do not ignore the case of file names". It is better regarded 
as an internal value, with which Git remembers how it should treat the 
names of files that it receives when it traverses the directories on the 
disk.

Git could probe the file system capabilities each time it runs. But that 
would be wasteful. Hence, this probe happens only once when the 
repository is initialized, and the result is recorded in this 
configuration value. You should not change it.

Then I don't think there is a way to remove the discrepancy.
