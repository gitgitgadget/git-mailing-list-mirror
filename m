Just to let everybody know, the application is submitted. For reference,
I've updated the submitted application text here:

  http://git.github.io/SoC-2014-Org-Application.html

I've collected the discussion on the list on the ideas page:

  http://git.github.io/SoC-2014-Ideas.html

Google folks will be looking at it over the next week, but prospective
students probably won't see it until we are accepted to the program,
which would happen Feb 24th.

Please feel free to continue discussing or updating the ideas page in
the meantime. I think there is enough there already to show Google what
we are thinking about, but ultimately the students are the ones whom the
page is meant to serve.  Anything we can do to improve it before they
read it is a good thing.
