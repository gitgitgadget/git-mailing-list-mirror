Yeah, my concern would be missing an accidental NULL here. I guess that
is pretty unlikely in practice, though. I'd guess the worst case would
be somebody accidentally putting the function into the "opt->value" slot
where the compiler might then think it is used (though I don't know
off-hand if it would complain about an implicit conversion of a function
pointer into a "void *").

Your patch looks correct to me. I probably wouldn't have bothered to
write it, but now you did. :) My inclination would be to go with my
dumb-simple one for this series, and it looks like you may have
collected a few slight-more-risky-but-maybe-worthwhile parseopt cleanups
on top that could make their own series.
