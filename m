I don't understand what you mean with "they are not really needed"?
The field is necessary to understand the protocol, no?

In the last roll I added the "key=value" format to the protocol upon
yours and Peff's suggestion. Would it be OK to change the startup
sequence accordingly?

packet:          git< version=2\n
packet:          git< capabilities=clean smudge\n

I agree with "shutdown". I think I would like to remove the "stream"
option and make it the default for the following reasons:

(1) As you mentioned elsewhere, "stream" is not really streaming at this
point because we don't read/write in parallel.

(2) Junio and you pointed out that if we transmit size and flush packet
then we have redundancy in the protocol.

(3) With the newly introduced "success"/"reject"/"failure" packet at the 
end of a filter operation, a filter process has a way to signal Git that
something went wrong. Initially I had the idea that a filter process just
stops writing and Git would detect the mismatch between expected bytes
and received bytes. But the final status packet is a much clearer solution.

(4) Maintaining two slightly different protocols is a waste of resources 
and only increases the size of this (already large) patch.

My only argument for the size packet was that this allows efficient buffer
allocation. However, in non of my benchmarks this was actually a problem.
Therefore this is probably a epsilon optimization and should be removed.

OK with everyone?

The implementation still requires the exact sequence of the packets.
However, we could make this more flexible in a later patch with the
"key=value" formatting.

AS mentioned above, I would like to remove the size packet completely
to simplify this patch. If there is really a need for such a packet
then we could add it later (given the flexible "key=value" format of the
protocol).

Right, that would be possible with the current implementation. I will
add an empty file to the test case to prove it.

How would you do this? Don't you think the current solution is
good enough for processes that don't need a proper shutdown?

Correct. Even if we implement a timeout - what time would we wait?
I think this is still the best option for now.

OK. How about this:

Git starts the filter when it encounters the first file
that needs to be cleaned or smudged. After the filter started
Git expects a welcome message, protocol version number, and 
filter capabilities separated by spaces:

Well, I think that should be clear to the reader, no?

Already discussed in http://public-inbox.org/git/6765D972-876A-4F94-A170-468002498296%40gmail.com/

I will add an example for the error case, too.

Well, I could add a github.com link but I don't think everyone
would like that. What would you suggest?

Would that be better?


Please note that you cannot use an existing `filter.<driver>.clean`
or `filter.<driver>.smudge` command as `filter.<driver>.process`
command because the former two use a different inter process 
communication protocol than the latter one. As soon as Git would detect 
a file that needs to be processed by such an invalid "process" filter, 
it would wait for a proper protocol handshake and appear "hanging".

Sure! Thanks again for the extensive review,
