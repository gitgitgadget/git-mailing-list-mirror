Sine this thread is 18 months old, I needed some recap to remember what
we were talking about. :)

It's here:

  http://public-inbox.org/git/20150126172409.GA15204@aepfle.de/T/#u

and the gist of it is that we'd like to drop the "Last updated" footer
from the HTML version of the manpages, but older versions of asciidoc
did not provide a mechanism.

The patch you quoted adds "footer-style=none", which would do the trick.
But I have two open questions:

  1. What does this do on older versions of asciidoc? Is it silently
     ignored (ok), or does it generate an error (bad)?

  2. This covers the HTML versions, but not the roff manpages (which
     are generated by docbook). Do we have a way to tweak the date in
     the latter?

     I don't think that's necessarily a requirement for this patch, but
     it is worth thinking about at the same time.

Assuming the answer to (1) is "ok" and (2) is "no, but it's hard because
docbook is scary, so let's punt", then somebody needs to write up the
commit message and send the actual patch to the list. Would you like to
try that?
