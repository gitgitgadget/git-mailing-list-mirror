Nah, I am not working with Synergy. I referred to an earlier encounter with it.

Right now, I am stuck with ClearCase. Most of the projects have been using base 
ClearCase, not UCM, and it means that there is no realistic way to transfer the 
histories anywhere. It can be tried, sure, but who would really want to do it?
What I am looking for is tools that I can recommend to the projects, tools 
that are available to them, and will not pose a threat in being non-convertible, 
tools that would allow the projects to later make another decision, and not get 
stuck with the tool they choose now.

Fair enough. I am looking for documentation, and advice on how to find worthy 
sources, before delving into trying out something for no good reason. 
But, at the same time, I wish to have a look-see on what the general status 
is right now. If there is no summary of it available, then apparently I have to 
make it myself. But I would hate to find out afterward that someone had in fact 
done it already. Tomas Carnecky's list is a good start.
