I found this to be true. The tone on the list could at times feel 
un-helpful (to the new person). It is almost as if it is an initiation - 
those on the list know the protocols, and new folk either arrive like a 
bull in a china shop, or more likely, timidly push the patch under the 
door and run away (and variations in between) - some never push out 
their (drafted) patch.

Sometimes it isn't 'mistakes', rather it is simply a lack of sufficient 
explanation to communicate intent, which may not have been understood by 
the reviewer/responder. In such cases it can be a frustration to know 
what was meant in the response, especially if the response is terse. 
[i.e. I think it would be reasonable to squeeze part of this in here 
somewhere to guide new contributors about this step]

There is separately a need to note the role of the maintainer, who has a 
more difficult role as gatekeeper who's higher standards in applying the 
precautionary principle 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precautionary_principle can feel like 
unhelpfulness, or worse if misunderstood.

I think she programmed in Smalltalk and CleanYourRoom. (sorry not my
