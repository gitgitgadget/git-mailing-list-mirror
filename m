I did wonder today in response to a discussion at work about version control 
of documentation, whether git could in some way understand OpenDocument 
format and allow some form of merging of concurrent changes to the same 
document.  I am not sure if just unzipping the files and applying standard 
merge strategies the resultant xml would be good enough.

Sadly just a thought at the moment.
