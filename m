Even on platforms where it _is_ a hard-limit, we are quite often dealing
with paths that come from tree objects (so even if the OS would
eventually complain about our path, it is small consolation when we
smash the stack before we get there).

Your patch looks good to me, and we definitely should address this
before v2.18-final.

I'm sad that this strcpy() wasn't caught in review. IMHO we should avoid
that function altogether, even when we _think_ it can't trigger an
overflow. That's easier to reason about (and makes auditing easier).

It looks like another one has crept in recently, too.

Subject: [PATCH] blame: prefer xsnprintf to strcpy for colors

Our color buffers are all COLOR_MAXLEN, which fits the
largest possible color. So we can never overflow the buffer
by copying an existing color. However, using strcpy() makes
it harder to audit the code-base for calls that _are_
problems. We should use something like xsnprintf(), which
shows the reader that we expect this never to fail (and
provides a run-time assertion if it does, just in case).

Another option would just be color_parse(repeated_meta_color, "cyan").
The run-time cost is slightly higher, but it probably doesn't matter
here, and perhaps it's more readable.

This one is less critical for v2.18.
