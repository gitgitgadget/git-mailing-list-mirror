Yes, the wording was pretty much confusing me, since i could not find a file
named "new-file" anywhere in the repo.


There are more things confusing concerning sparse mode:

- It is not clear from git-sparse-checkout(1) when changes to
  $GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout are catched up. In my case: would it be enough
  to add the new pathname just before git-mv or would a fresh git-checkout be
  needed after modifying $GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout? You have clarified
  this in your response, but shouldn't this be clear from the manpage?

- git-sparse-checkout(1) refers to "skip-worktree bit". This concept is
  potentially not very familiar to the average git user which uses mostly
  porcelain. Thus, edge cases remain to be unclear.

- The pathspecs refers to .gitignore (which by itself is not very clear). But
  there are differences:
  1. giignore is relative to containing directoy, which don't seem to make
     much sense for sparse mode
  2. sparse specs are the opposite of gitignore, which seems to have different
     meaning in some edge-cases.

- For cone, it is not clear how the two "accepted patterns" look like what the
  semantics are. I understand that specifying a directory adds siblings
  recursively. But what does the "Parent" mode mean exactly and when/how is
  this recognized? I guess, this is just a mis-namer? IMHO, parent of /a/b/c would
  be /a/b and not /a/b/c/* (as git-sparse-chekout(1) suggests).

I guess all this is very clear to the core-developers. But for the occasional
user like myself, all this is pretty much confusing.
