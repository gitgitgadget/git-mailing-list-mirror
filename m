If I read the Wikipedia article [1] about the utf-8 design choices it is 
pretty reasonable and robust most of the time, though that maybe a part 
one way trapdoor.

It maybe that the rebase doc may need (if it happens) a short comment 
warning of that.

Also need to check if the `label_oid()` function actually makes the 
label distinct, hence prevents such labels from being used as such a 
restricted file name - i.e. does it include the oid element.

Ultimately the label could be tweaked to have say the 4char prefix to 
fool the Windows 'starts with' name detection - which assumes I 
understand how some of those bad filenames are detected...
