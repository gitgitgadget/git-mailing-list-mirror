Yeah, sorry, I was being quite sloppy with my wording. I meant "wrong"
as in "I would ideally flag this in review for being weird and
confusing".

Of course there are many reasonable cases where you might pass an
integer "foo" rather than explicitly booleanizing it with "!!foo". So I
do agree it's a real potential problem (and I'm sufficiently convinced
that we should avoid an "int" fallback if we can).
