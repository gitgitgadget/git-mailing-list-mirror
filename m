This is one possible solution.

Another variant of this would be to enable rerere feature (reuse
recorded resolution), and periodically do a trial merge from the
Origin/Development branch to prime the rerere mechanism (discarding
those merges after resolving them).

There is yet another solution:

OR

* Periodically _rebase_ pure feature branch on top of current version
of Origin/Development, or do such rebase (perhaps an interactive one
to clean-up feature development steps) before pull request, before
they are to merge feature branch into Origin/Development.

You can also try to use third-party git-imerge tool to help merging
long divergent branches.
