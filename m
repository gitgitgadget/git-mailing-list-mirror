Thanks, this is definitely my bug introduced by b8ba412bf7 and this is
the right fix.

I continue to find the whole xalloca() thing pretty gross, and doubly so
now that there are _two_ layers of "maybe alloca(), and maybe malloc()"
logic (one in xalloca(), and one in this FAST_ARRAY stuff).

We should definitely take this fix to address the immediate problem, but
I wonder if this size logic should be pushed into xalloca to make this
kind of problem harder. Of course this is the only caller, so it might
not matter much either way.

(I'd also be really happy to see it go away entirely, as alloca() is a
foot-gun in the first place. But I think it did make things slightly
faster. It might be worth re-measuring).
