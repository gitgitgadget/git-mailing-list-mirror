Or that somebody just didn't want to be embarrassed by introducing such
obvious nonsense into the test suite. :)

I was curious, though, whether there was still a lurking bug in
"--ignore-blank-lines", based on what that comment says. But I don't
think so. It reports the correct numbers for this test case, but that's
because the blank line drops off the context. If we add -U4, then it
does mention 6 lines in the preimage, and includes the line.

Which matches what Ren√© claimed in the commit message: "Changes
involving only blank lines are hidden with --ignore-blank-lines, unless
they appear in the context lines of other changes." But now I've
double-checked. :)

(And I agree that the output after this patch is way better).
