Yeah, this NULL computation is pretty nasty. I recall trying to get rid
of it, but I think it is impossible to do so portably while still using
the generic xalloc_flex() helper. I'm not sure why I didn't think of
just inlining it as you do here. It's not that many lines of code, and I
I agree the result is conceptually simpler.

This looks correct. I wondered at first why you bothered with
flex_array_len, but it is to avoid evaluating the "len" parameter
multiple times.

Now that xalloc_flex() has only this one caller remaining, perhaps it
should just be inlined here, too, for simplicity.
