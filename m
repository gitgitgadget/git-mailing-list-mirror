How about this:

Please note that you cannot use an existing `filter.<driver>.clean`
or `filter.<driver>.smudge` command with `filter.<driver>.process`
because the former two use a different inter process communication
protocol than the latter one. As soon as Git would detect a file
that needs to be processed by such an invalid "process" filter, 
it would wait for a proper protocol handshake and appear "hanging".

I like `multi_packet_read` and will rename!

Git LFS works well with the current clean/smudge mechanism that uses the
same on in memory buffers. I understand your concern but I think this
improvement is out of scope for this patch series.

Agreed!

As mentioned in a previous email... I will drop the "size" support in
this patch series as it is not really needed.

Yes, it is limited but I agree on ssize_t!

Would that check be ok?

According to Peff zero for success is the usual style:

True, but as discussed previously I will remove the size.

Right, that's what I though.

OK. How about this?

	ssize_t bytes_to_write;
	while (!did_fail) {

This one does not exist.

I would like to keep them separate as it is easier to comprehend.

I think so, but this would be out of scope for this series :)

I copied that from config.c:
https://github.com/git/git/blob/f8f7adce9fc50a11a764d57815602dcb818d1816/config.c#L1425-L1428

`git grep "tablesize"` reveals that the check for `tablesize` is only used
in hashmap.c ... so what approach should we use?

What do you mean by "worth it to use strbuf for cmd"? Why would

Yes.

Agreed.

I will put it into the docs.

Mh. I wanted to convey that this functions is protocol V2 related...

Initially I had one function but that got kind of long ... I prefer two for now.

"If the stream argument is NULL, fflush() flushes all
 open output streams."

Agreed.

The protocol V2 requires a sequential processing of the packets. See
discussion with Junio here:

[LONG SNIP]

I will answer the second half in a separate email.

Thanks for the review,
