Right now, the project is just an idea, so I didn't consider an idea
in particular. But I'd love to get people to work on libgit2 (I really
think this is _the_ thing that SVN has and that Git lacks), and
therefore, I'd love my students to work on this.

But as much as possible, I'll wait and decide the exact project with
the students.

Thanks for the pointer.

OTOH, I don't know whether we'd get as much feedback working on
libgit2 than working on Git itself.
