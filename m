I bought rights to the image from iStockPhoto, we can use it online
for whatever we want to.  The only restriction is that we can't sell
stuff with the image on it. I have no idea what NHK is, nor do I know
how TM/copyright issues would work in this regard - (the site is
hosted in the US, has NHK registered TM for that here?) - but I doubt
it really matters.  If I get a cease and desist, I'll replace the
image, but to me it doesn't seem close enough to infringe and I doubt
they would care.

Btw, I would also like to say in general that the response to this
from emails sent to me personally (my address is at the bottom of the
page) has been very positive and I've even received a few patches that
are now live.

Also, Miklos : your patch changes the format of the output and doesn't
speed things up or anything, so I'm just sticking with the current
script for now (unless I'm missing something).

Boyd Gerber: I'm confused - the mailing list archive link on the home
page points to the Gmane page, which is completely up to date.  Is
there a link I'm missing?

Thanks,
Scott
