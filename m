Dear diary, on Tue, Oct 25, 2005 at 06:57:06PM CEST, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> told me that...
> Also we need a link to this in either Ancillary (in which
> subsection I am not sure of, though) or Synching repository
> section of git.txt.  I think we already lack links to a couple

for i in `l Documentation/*.txt | cut -d / -f 2 | cut -d . -f 1`; do
grep -q $i Documentation/git.txt || echo $i; done

But really, the more you have autogenerated, the better and more
consistent things are. In Cogito, I have all the documentation (usage
strings, synopsis, description, ...) at a _single_ place and everything
else (from command lists to various views of the docs) is autogenerated,
and it's a great help at making things complete and consistent. Also,
since it's inside of the code, people actually tend to remember to
update (and write in the first place) the documentation.


BTW, as of now, it appears that only the commands git-findtags and
git-fmt-merge-msg are undocumented.

VI has two modes: the one in which it beeps and the one in which
it doesn't.
