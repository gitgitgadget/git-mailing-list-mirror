Hello everybody, thanks for your help, I really appreciate it!

What I have described was only an abstract example, because I did not  
want to bother you with the whole story. I will try to explain my  
actual situation:
- first: there is no txt. file, it is jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) and  
they are not only about programming, there are also lots of markdown
- second: I am working with my professor over GitLab and I look for  
options to further improve these notebooks
- third: I have to develope a nice GitLab workflow

I know, diffing and merging of notebooks is another story (but we can  
handle that with nbdime).
And I know, there are lots of guides on git workflows on the internet  
(and that is pretty much just what I have adopted).

So this is how we proceed:
- my prof has a repo on GitHub
- I have forked the repo
- I have cloned the forked repo
- I have created a branch 'update' in my local clone
- I edit a notebook on the branch 'update' and commit
- I push 'update' to my forked repo on GitHub
- I create a merge request
- my prof reviews the changes and accepts them (if I have done  
acceptable work)

So the last point is where we still want to do some fine tuning. Right  
now this looks about: my prof fetches my edits and locally checks out  
a branch to compare the changes with git diff.
But in this diff view you can't edit the files. So you have to  
separately open up another window to edit the changes (lets say my  
prof only wants to keep some of my changes, but not all).

So my Question is: is there any possibility, to be able to view (and  
even edit, if necessary) the changed notebook in the merging process  
(as in my example with the 3way merge)?
Or is the only option to separately view the diff and edit the  
notebook (two seperate steps instead of one)?

The latter would also be acceptable, if it really is the only way. Bu  
it would be nice, if viewing and editing could be done in one  
convenient step during merging.

Many greetings
Andr√© Ulrich
