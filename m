Good find, and nicely explained.

This should be the only place. We already ran into this with the
commit-index field, which was what caused us to create object_as_type()
in the first place, to give a central place for coercing OBJ_NONE into
other types.

Agreed. We can deal with those if it ever becomes necessary. In theory
adding empty placeholder functions might help somebody realize they'd
need to handle this case, but I have the feeling that they'd be as
likely to miss init_tree_node() as they would object_as_type().

I dunno. I guess if init_tree_node() were actually called from
alloc_tree_node(), it might be harder to miss.

The patch itself looks good to me.
