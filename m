Unlike "git grep", "git log" works with boolean expression that does
not explicitly have a way to say "--and" and "--or", so only one
interpretation has been chosen long time ago.  All the terms are
ORed together, and then the whole thing can be inverted with
"--invert-grep".  i.e. you are telling an equivalent of

    $ git grep --not \( -e "author someone" --or -e "something" \)

with the command line, and there is no way to combine the requested
match criteria (there are two, "author must be somebody" and
"something must be in the message") differently.

Given that, that is the "right" expectation, and as long as you get
the behaviour, there is no "bug".

You can call it a lack of feature, though, and patches to implement
a more flexible combination of match criteria like "git grep" allows
is always welcome.
