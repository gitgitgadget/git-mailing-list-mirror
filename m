Hey all,

yes, it is true: since mid-August I am working for Microsoft. Over a
year ago, I got into contact with the Visual Studio Online group at
Microsoft, of which I am now a happy member. A large part of my mission
is to improve the experience of Git for Windows. This is very exciting
to me: I finally can focus pretty much full time on something that I
could only address in my spare time previously.

Of course, Git for Windows will stay exactly the same project as before.
It will not suddenly turn into a Microsoft product. Obviously, it will
stay Open Source, its goal remains to bring the awesome Git SCM to
Windows, and I will continue to participate actively in the Git
community, if anything even more actively. After the release of Git for
Windows 2.5.0 and 2.5.1, there are quite a few loose ends to tie up; All
the better that I can now dedicate enough time to address them, and that
I now also have time to work properly with contributors on improving Git
for Windows.

I am really excited to join the club of Git developers who get paid to
work on Git as part of their day-jobs.

In short: for users and contributors of Git for Windows, nothing
changes. Except that Pull Requests and issues may be dealt with more
swiftly, and that I will actively work on keeping Git for Windows more
closely in sync with Git proper.

Good times!
Johannes
