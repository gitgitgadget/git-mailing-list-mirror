Indeed it is. Thanks Till for providing an easy reproducer.

I think whenever git overwrites an untracked file without the user 
passing some option indicating that they want to do so it is a bug. For 
example "git checkout" refuses to overwrite untracked files by default. 
Sadly this seems to be a known bug in do_push_stash() where we are using 
"git reset --hard" to remove the stashed changes from the working copy. 
This was documented in 94b7f1563a (Comment important codepaths regarding 
nuking untracked files/dirs, 2021-09-27). The stash implementation does 
a lot of necessary forking of subprocesses, in this case I think it 
would be better to call unpack_trees() directly with 
UNPACK_RESET_PROTECT_UNTRACKED.
