Hi,

I wanted to ask about current status of Git-Eclipse support. Is this 
plugin able to actually do anything or not? What works and what does not? 
Can it be used by developers using Git? Or maybe git-svn or git-cvsserver 
are better?

If it it not usable at the moment do you have any idea when it may be 
usable? I know several developers really waiting for such support even 
early or beta quality.


Thanks,

Grzegorz Kulewski
