The file processed by `git commit-graph` is referred to as the
"commit-graph file", also with a dash. We have a few references to the
"commit graph file", though, without the dash. These occur in
git-commit-graph.txt as well as in Doc/technical/commit-graph.txt. Fix
them.

Do not change the references to the "commit graph" (without "... file")
as a data structure.
