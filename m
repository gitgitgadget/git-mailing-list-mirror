I have a few financial logistics questions for the Git community.

I had a few people ask me earlier about travel assistance. I don't know
how much room there is in GitHub's budget for this[1].  I'll look into
getting money there, but we may also want to spend Git project funds for
this.

Does anybody have opinions on the logistics? I'm generally in favor of
transparency when it comes to handling project affairs, but my
inclination is to keep travel assistance requests and rewards off the
list to protect people's privacy. So the simplest scheme is probably
something like:

  1. I'll collect names of people who are interested in assistance.

  2. I'll present the list to the Git committee of Junio, Shawn, and
     myself. We'll come up with a proposal for who we can fund and how
     much.

  3. We'll send the amount (but not the names) to the list for comment.

  4. Barring objections, we'll tell Conservancy to authorized the money.

I'm open to comments on the process as a whole, or guidelines for us to
use in step 2. It's the project's money, so I'd like to give as much
opportunity as possible for people to have a say in how it's spent.

[1] There is a conference fee for the "main" day, which I think will be
    $99/person, but the plan is for all proceeds to go to
    the Software Freedom Conservancy. The dev summit is free. I can look
    into waivers for individual git contributors, but I'd prefer to
    avoid doing a blanket waiver. For those folks whose employers will
    send them to a conference, I think it's nice for that money to go to
    Conservancy.
