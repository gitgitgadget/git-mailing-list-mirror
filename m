My comment, as a simple reader, is that I misread the order of the 
items, in that I miss-associate the description paragraph with the * 
title _below_. That is, I see the description first and then read on...

Thinking about it, if the description paragraph was indented by one 
space then the * title  would create that obvious content indent that (I 
am) would be expected.

Obviously only a useful suggestion if it's easy to implement...
