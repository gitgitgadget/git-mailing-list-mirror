Yup, you should have told that to me back in Aug 2008 ;-) when I did
0cf8581e ("checkout -m: recreate merge when checking out of unmerged
index", 2008-08-30); pretend_sha1_file() was available since early
2007, and there is no excuse that this codepath did not use it.

Yes.

In the very old days it was not allowed to free(3) contents of
active_cache[] and this was an old brain fart that came out of
inertia.  We are manufacturing a brand new ce, only to feed it to
checkout_entry() without even registering it to the active_cache[]
array, and the ancient rule doesn't even apply to such a case.

So I think it was safe to free(3) even back then.

> And result_buf is still leaked here, right?

Good spotting.  It typically would make a larger leak than a single
ce, I would suppose ;-)
