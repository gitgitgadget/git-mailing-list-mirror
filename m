Can you explain more why the old behavior is a problem? For reasons (see
below), we want to do something like:

  git for-each-ref --format='%(objectname)' |
  git commit-graph write --stdin-commits

In v2.23 and earlier, that worked exactly like --reachable, but now it
will blow up if there are any refs that point to a non-commit (e.g., a
tag of a blob).

It can be worked around by asking for %(objecttype) and %(*objecttype)
and grepping the result, but that's awkward and much less efficient
(especially if you have a lot of annotated tags, as we may have to open
and parse each one).

Now obviously you could just use --reachable for the code above. But
here are two plausible cases where you might not want to do that:

 - you're limiting the graph to only a subset of refs (e.g., you want to
   graph refs/heads/ and refs/tags, but not refs/some-other-weird-area/).

 - you're generating an incremental graph update. You know somehow that
   a few refs were updated, and you want to feed those tips to generate
   the incremental, but not the rest of the refs (not because it would
   be wrong to do so, but in the name of keeping it O(size of change)
   and not O(number of refs in the repo).

The latter is the actual case that bit us. I suppose one could do
something like:

  git rev-list --no-walk <maybe-commits |
  git commit-graph write --stdin-commits

to use rev-list as a filter, but that feels kind of baroque.

Normally I'm in favor of more error checking instead of less, but in
this case it feels like it's putting scripted use at a disadvantage
versus the internal code (e.g., the auto-write for git-fetch uses the
"--reachable" semantics for its internal invocation).

PS As an aside, I think the internal git-fetch write could benefit from
   this same trick: feed the set of newly-stored ref tips to the
   commit-graph machinery, rather than using for_each_ref().
