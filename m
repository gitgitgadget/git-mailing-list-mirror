One thing that thread reminded me of: we probably also want to default
pack.writebitmaphashcache on. Otherwise the time saved during the object
enumeration can backfire when we spend much more time trying delta
compression (because we don't know the pathnames of any objects).

The reason it defaults to off is for on-disk compatibility with JGit.
But I have very little experience running without the hash-cache on. We
added it very early on because we found performance was not great
without it (I don't know if people running JGit have run into the same
problem and if not, why not).

This looks good to me, with one minor nit:

This last line could use "test_must_be_empty".
