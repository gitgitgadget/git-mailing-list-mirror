Yes.  I think its already been agreed upon to make this a web based
survey, as that is easy to submit and accumlate the results through.
Many web based survey systems allow you to randomize the order of
the answers, for exactly the reason you state.

Personally I've always found such surveys to be annoying, but on
the other hand it really forces me to slow down and read the thing
when I can't just binary search through the answers looking for
what I think should be there.
