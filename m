It will apply the patches in the order given on the command line. When
your shell expands the "patches/*" glob, it will do so in lexically
sorted order. Meaning "0001" comes before "0002", etc, which is the
reason that format-patch zero-pads the filenames.

You can edit or delete the patches in your patch directory before
applying, and they should apply the same (unless you create a patch that
cannot actually be applied).
