Yes, I'm willing to co-admin (though I'm also happy to step aside for
somebody else if they would like to do it).

The biggest task there is getting the application together. I went
through the account creation steps at the site (which is different this
year), and the application questions are:

 - Why does your org want to participate in Google Summer of Code?

 - How many potential mentors have agreed to mentor this year?

 - How will you keep mentors engaged with their students?

 - How will you help your students stay on schedule to complete their projects?

 - How will you get your students involved in your community during GSoC?

 - How will you keep students involved with your community after GSoC?

 - Has your org been accepted as a mentoring org in Google Summer of Code before?

 - Are you part of a foundation/umbrella organization?

 - What year was your project started? 

I think we can pull most of these answers from previous-year
applications, but I haven't looked yet. In years past we collaborated on
the answers via the git.github.io site, and I pasted them in place.
