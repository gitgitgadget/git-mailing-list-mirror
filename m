If you forbid people to ask for help when the person who is
asked might feel the question groundless or based on "only
mental experiments not verified in practice and inattentive
reading of the code", the value to have a community diminishes.

We ask questions and ask for help because we know others know
more about things we do not know offhand, not necessarily
because we would not ever be able to figure them out ourselves.

If you know somebody else would know the answer immediately for
something that may take you a day or so to figure out, asking
for help is the right thing to do --- your time is better spent
on what you do best (e.g. improving Cogito).  I should not feel
bothered by your questions, and I am certainly not feeling
bothered at all (well, at least until seeing the last sentence,
and wondering what you really meant ;-)).

Always glad to be of help.
