Thanks for the review.
My understanding is that there are different things possible with `git 
apply`:
working on files in the index ("cached") files and "worktree" files.

If we work on files in the index, the line endings must match for
the patch to apply, the patch/apply machinery is not forgiving
mismatching line endings. At least not by default.
There is one exception: Use "blank-at-eol" to declare the CR of
the CRLF as a whitespace, and then tell git apply to ignore white space:
`git apply --ignore-whitespace`
My feeling is that this is not self-explaining, but this is a different 
story.

Back to the fix, the read_old_data() from below works on the working tree,
yes, but after convert_to_git().
And that is why we need the index, to fix this very case.

appy.c:
static int load_patch_target(struct apply_state *state,
                  struct strbuf *buf,
                  const struct cache_entry *ce,
                  struct stat *st,
                  const char *name,
                  unsigned expected_mode)
{
     if (state->cached || state->check_index) {
         if (read_file_or_gitlink(ce, buf))
             return error(_("failed to read %s"), name);
     } else if (name) {
         if (S_ISGITLINK(expected_mode)) {
             if (ce)
                 return read_file_or_gitlink(ce, buf);
             else
                 return SUBMODULE_PATCH_WITHOUT_INDEX;
         } else if (has_symlink_leading_path(name, strlen(name))) {
             return error(_("reading from '%s' beyond a symbolic link"), 
name);
         } else {
             if (read_old_data(st, name, buf))
                 return error(_("failed to read %s"), name);
         }
     }
     return 0;
}
