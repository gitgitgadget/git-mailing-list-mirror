Hi !

Is it really only my own stupidity, or is the "tutorial" in the README
file in there only understandable if you in fact already know what it
tries to explain ?

The more I read it, the more confused I am about the whole thing...

Is there some document somewhere that starts by explaining what are the
concepts of "branch", "tracking", etc... in the context of git ?

Ben.
