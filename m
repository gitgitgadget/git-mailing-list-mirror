Stashing changes *away* would mean a move in my mental model (as in
command line mv): Whatever gets copied to stash gets removed in working 
area. And what doesn't get removed, doesn't get copied to stash.

Thus, --keep-index *would* ignore the index and only move working-tree
to the stash minus the changes already staged.

BUT, that might lead to other problems, I suppose.

The current behaviour can cause problems as in the Stackoverflow
question where someone already staged some hunks, and on
stashing with -p gets asked about these *again*. Which does make
the workflow more tedious.

Aha, now it gets interesting. So you are saying, it doesn't matter if
the stash entry also contains the already staged changes A? Well in the 
combination with -p it does (see Stackoverflow question and above).

Even if auto-merging will take care of it (?), it would be good to
have the manpage clarify things that might confuse people.

Disclaimer: I am not a git expert, so I may be getting things wrong. I
just noticed the Stackoverflow question, answered it (only because
an adequate answer did not exist yet) and then saw a similar topic
being raised here.

I am not sure yet about the text. Still in the clarifying phase.
