I think it's a chicken-and-egg. I'd love to run the test suite with tsan
from time to time, but there's no point if it turns up a bunch of false
positives.

The general direction here looks good to me (and I agree with the
comments made so far, especially that we should stop writing to
strbuf_slopbuf entirely).

>   ThreadSanitizer: add suppressions

This one is the most interesting because it really is just papering over
the issues. I "solved" the transfer_debug one with actual code in:

  https://public-inbox.org/git/20170710133040.yom65mjol3nmf2it@sigill.intra.peff.net/

but it just feels really dirty. I'd be inclined to go with suppressions
for now until somebody can demonstrate or argue for an actual breakage
(just because it makes the tool more useful for finding _real_
problems).
