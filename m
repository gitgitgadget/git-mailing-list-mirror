It's hard to decipher what you're really asking for here, but I'll take 
a stab at it.

If you're asking for a version of our software to put on the CD-ROM that 
comes with your magazine, then I can only say that our software is free 
software (as governed by the GPLv2 license), and that you can put it on 
your CD-ROM subject to the same terms as any other GPL program on your 
CD-ROMs.

If you're looking for more information on the Git project, please refer 
to the project's homepage at git-scm.com.

Otherwise, feel free to ask specific to-the-point questions directly on 
this mailing list.


Hope this helps,

...Johan
