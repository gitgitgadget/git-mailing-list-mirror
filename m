Digging into earlier cases I had seen on my local box, my impression was
that this was the problem I was seeing (not reordering). But it's
entirely possible that I was confused by reordering. I've been trying to
reproduce, but after 5 minutes of t5561 running in a tight loop under
high load, I haven't gotten a single failure.

I can't reproduce for now, so I'm happy either way. :)

Great. That seems much simpler to reason about. I'll take a look.
