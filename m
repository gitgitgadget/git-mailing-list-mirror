As we approach 50 people, does it makes sense to be able to break the
event down into 2 "tracks", and have 2 meeting spaces available? I
know a number of the folks on the attendee list are Gerrit Code Review
/ Android sorts of shops and will want to discuss topics related to
that that aren't necessarily relevant to the GitHub users / Linux
kernel hacking folks that are also on the list. Being able to break
off some of those discussions might make the event more interesting
for everyone involved.
