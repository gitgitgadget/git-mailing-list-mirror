I feel your pain. Somewhere around here I (think I) still have the full
CVS dump of Plex86 that I never properly found a new home for (11 years
ago). As it won't compile on anything newer than 2.4.x and Kevin Lawton
folded most of it back into Bochs I highly doubt there's a lot of people
looking for it.

Well, that is a problem then! I had thought the problem was fashioning a
replacement for our jargon noun-form. Now that I think of it, English
has got to be hard to start from in general with its 45k word
"canonical" (approximate current use) set--and that's when we don't
compound or conjugate them in odd new ways or otherwise exercise
implements of linguistic destruction upon them.
