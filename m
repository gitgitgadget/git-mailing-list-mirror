Yes. HEAD is a pointer to committed state. HEAD is an alias for the
current branch.

Yes.

It's a low-level aspect of git's unified storage model. The various
object types, (blob, tree, commit, tag),  are defined quite clearly in
the documentation.

Simply a pointer to the DAG that moves as new commits are created
while "on" that branch.

Yes.

No. Creating a new branch simply references some existing commit in
the DAG already.

No. If you merged you would have history that looks like this:

 /-> B -\
A        D
 \-> C -/

> Is there a standard revision notation?

Yes. See the documentation for git-rev-parse and the section on
specifing revisions, (hint: when you run a command like "git log" and
see long sequence of hex characters, you can use those (or abbreviated
versions of those) to name revisons). You can also do many other
things as described in the documentation.

[Beyond this point you bring in too many svn misconceptions to make
the questions easy to answer.]
