I suspect by now my endorsement would count at least a bit, so ...

Linus, I'm with David on this one.  I haven't reviewed his stuff
in this latest incarnation but I did review the draft a round
before and I felt it was accurate and ready for public (meaning
Porcelain layer writers and brave end users) consumption.

Linus, I'm with David on this one.  Text is Good.
