Yeah, it probably is the right thing to make the options as orthogonal
as possible, and let the user decide what they want. I was just
wondering if I could replace my "stress" script with this. But I think
I'd still want it to remember to use a sane set of options (including
"--root" in my case).

That seems reasonable. There's also no point in waiting for them to
finish if we know we're aborting anyway. Could we just kill them all?

I guess it's a little tricky, because $! is going to give us the pid of
each subshell. We actually want to kill the test sub-process. That takes
a few contortions, but the output is nice (every sub-job immediately
says "ABORTED ...", and the final process does not exit until the whole
tree is done):

With the patch as posted I actually see most of them still say "OK",
because the SIGINT does not make it to them (it would be a different
story if I killed the whole process group).

But with the modification above, I get "ABORTED" for most, which is what
I'd want. And it should be pretty race-free, since the "aborted" file is
put into place before triggering the signal cascade.

Two separate files seems a lot simpler to me.

Don't you then use your terminal to display the file? ;) (I'm kidding, I
assume you load it in "less" or whatever, which is distinct).

I wish this could be optional somehow, though. I really prefer the dump.
I guess if I continue to use my script as a wrapper, it can dump for me
(after digging in the $stressfail file, I guess).

We could rename it to "trash directory.xxx.failed", which is at least
predictable. That can even be done atomically, though I think it's a
little tricky to do portably with shell tools. I guess I can continue to
do the symlink thing in my wrapper script.
