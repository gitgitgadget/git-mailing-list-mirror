Actually although I like C++, that's not the reason, the reason is that Qt
is a significantly (IMHO) better toolkit than Tk.  It's more cross platform
and looks a lot nicer.  The fact that it's C++ is neither here nor there.

Personally I find these language wars a bit distasteful; to me programming
is programming - the language is a purely secondary point.
