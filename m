Even with keeping the order this can be done in a single linear pass.
See filter_string_list() for an example.

The one twist here is that you cannot:

  oidcpy(array->oid[i], array->oid[j]);

when i==j, because of memcpy restrictions. With the current
implementation it would suffice to use struct assignment (and really,
every oidcpy() could just be struct assignment these days). But you
could also just do:

  if (i != j)
    oidcpy(array->oid[i], array->oid[j]);

I think the point is that we can just maintain those meanings during the
single walk through the array. The result is simpler to read and more
efficient.
