Lots of discussion in this thread. Let's try to turn it into some
patches. :)

After the patches below, I can compile cleanly with gcc 9.2.1 using
-flto with both -O2 and -O3 (some of the cases only seemed to trigger
for me with -O3).

I've ordered them in decreasing value. The first one is a real bugfix,
the second is a related cleanup. The next 3 are appeasing the compiler,
but I think are a good idea (but note I went more for root causes than
your originals). The last one is perhaps more controversial, but IMHO
worth doing.
