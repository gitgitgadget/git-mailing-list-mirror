On the other hand Git has you covered even if you did something 
non-standard, like starting new repo from the _state_ of 'e', that
is you have just copied files and created new repository, having
'e' (or actually 'e*') as an initial commit.

   original A<-B<-C<-D<-E<-F
                \
   first branch  b<-c<-d<-e

   new repo               e*<-f<-g<-h

Note that arrows are in reverse direction, as it is newer commit
pointing to its parents, not vice versa.

Assuming that you have everything in a single repository, by adding
both original and new repo as "remotes", you can use 'git replace'
command to replace 'e*' with 'e'.

   original A<-B<-C<-D<-E<-F
                \
   first branch  b<-c<-d<-e
                           \
   new repo                 \-f<-g<-h
   (with refs/replace)

>> new repo                 f->g->h

Then you would have the above history in repositories that fetched
refs/replace/*, and the one below if replacement info is absent:

   original A<-B<-C<-D<-E<-F<-----------M
                \                      /
   first branch  b<-c<-d<-e           /
                                     /
   new repo               e*<-f->g->h

But as Junio said it is highly unlikely that you are in this situation.
