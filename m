You actually encountered this particular error message, correct? Was
that before or after you fixed the race in builtin/worktree.c itself
via patch 1/2? Did the reported 'errno' indicate that the file did not
exist or was it some other error?

"git worktree add" is careful to invoke other Git commands only after
"commondir" exists, so it's not clear how this circumstance arises if
the file is indeed missing by the time the other Git command is run.

I understand that, but setup.c:get_common_dir_noenv() is concerned
only with _this_ worktree -- the one in which the Git command is being
run -- so it's not clear if or how some other partially-initialized
worktree could have any impact. (And, I'm having trouble fathoming how
it could, which is why I'm asking these questions).

Is it possible that when you saw that error message, it actually arose
from some code other than setup.c:get_common_dir_noenv()?

Checking whether the file has content _is_ a form of validation, even
if not extensive validation.

As noted above, it's not clear from the commit message how this case
can arise given that setup.c:get_common_dir_noenv() is presumably
concerned with and only consults _this_ worktree, so I'm having
trouble understanding how the state of other worktrees could impact
it.

Because the _presence_ of that file indicates a linked worktree,
whereas it's absence indicates the main worktree. If the file is
present but empty, then that is an abnormal condition, i.e. some form
of corruption.

The difference is significant, and that's why I'm asking if the new
behavior is correct or desirable. If you start interpreting this
abnormal condition as a non-error, then get_common_dir_noenv() will be
reporting that this is the main worktree when in fact it is (a somehow
corrupted) linked worktree. Such false reporting could trigger
undesirable and outright wrong behavior in callers.
