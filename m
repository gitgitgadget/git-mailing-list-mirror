Hmm. I haven't reproduced your exact issue, but I was able to produce
some hijinks in that function.

The problem is that the hashmap_iter interface is unreliable if entries
are added or removed from the map during the iteration.

I suspect the patch below may fix things for you. It works around it by
walking over the lru list (either is fine, as they both contain all
entries, and since we're clearing everything, we don't care about the
order).
