It's the "rolling" thing, though the source is a bit subtle. The
credential-cache helper sets an absolute expiration when the value is
stored, and it doesn't update it on a "get" request.

However, Git's interaction with the helpers is generally:

  - when we need a credential ask for one

  - when a credential is rejected by a server, tell helpers to erase it

  - when a credential is accepted by a server, tell helpers to store it

And it's that last one that provides the rolling timeout, because we do
it even if the credential came from a helper in the first place!

I actually wrote a patch long ago to switch this behavior:

  https://lore.kernel.org/git/20120407033417.GA13914@sigill.intra.peff.net/

But it turned out some people actually rely on it. :)

There's some discussion in that thread about paths forward, and I think
I even played around with it back then. But then it sat on my todo list,
and now it has been 9 years, so I don't remember if there were good
reasons not to push it forward, or if I simply never got around to it (I
suspect the latter; nobody had a pressing use case that was solved by
avoiding the rolling timeouts, it just seemed to me to be a bit less
surprising). I'd be happy if somebody wanted to revisit the topic.

(To your other question, "is there a way to see the timeout value", the
answer is "not really, without running it under gdb". I wouldn't be
opposed to adding more diagnostic output to the daemon. But you can also
see some of what's going on by setting GIT_TRACE=1 in the environment,
which will show the extra "store" operation being done by Git).
