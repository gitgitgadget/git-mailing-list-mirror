That's a definite compatibility question for taking your patches into
upstream git.

It does look better than the output generated by the "man -Tdvi" loop I
posted. It retains more styling from the HTML and it has a nice table of
contents. But 3 hours? Yeesh. Mine took 11 seconds.

I wonder if a more sane route is to drop HTML entirely, convert the
asciidoc to docbook (which we already do for manpages), and then create
a docbook document that is a collection of all elements, which can then
be converted to pdf, epub, or whatever. I would not be surprised if
somebody has solved this problem before (but it is not really my itch,
so I did not look very far).
