Hello All,

I am using Git for my internal project at work, after convincing my
employer to switch to git.
I am enjoying working with git but now as the project is about to
complete we are faced with the issues of bug tracking and issuing
system.

I would like to get a general view from the git developers and
experienced users on this.
Especially i would like to know of any good defect tracking systems
which can work really well with git.

thanks in advance.
[PS: please CC me as i am not subscribed to git devel list]
