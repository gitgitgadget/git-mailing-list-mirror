I have re-arranged the first half of commit message: 

  091f4cf3 (commit: don't use generation numbers if not needed,
  2018-08-30) changed paint_down_to_common() to use commit dates instead
  of generation numbers v1 (topological levels) as the performance
  regressed on certain topologies. With generation number v2 (corrected
  commit dates) implemented, we no longer have to rely on commit dates and
  can use generation numbers.
  
  For example, the command `git merge-base v4.8 v4.9` on the Linux
  repository walks 167468 commits, taking 0.135s for committer date and
  167496 commits, taking 0.157s for corrected committer date respectively.
  
  While using corrected commit dates Git walks nearly the same number of
  commits as commit date, the process is slower as for each comparision we
  have to access a commit-slab (for corrected committer date) instead of
  accessing struct member (for committer date).

We could, but that breaks conformity with `generation_numbers_enabled()`.

I see both functions to be similar in nature, to answer whether the
commit-graph has X? X could be topological levels or corrected commit
dates.

Right, that's an accidental change. I wanted to group
generation_numbers_enabled() and corrected_commit_dates_enabled()
together.
