I feel like we're trying to push hashmaps a little beyond
their capability.  I mean the core hashmap code is NOT thread
safe.  The caller is responsible for carefully controlling how
the hashmap is used and whatever locking strategy it wants --
whether it is a single lock on the entire hashmap -- or a set
of partition-specific locks like I created here.  Whatever the
strategy, it is outside of hashmap.[ch].

Perhaps it would be best to just define things as:
* let (size < 0) mean we choose not to compute/track it (without
   saying why).
* keep "disallow_rehash = 1" to mean we do not want automatic
   resizing (without saying why).

Thread-aware callers will set both.

Thread-aware callers (when finished with threaded operations)
can themselves choose whether to compute the correct size and
re-allow rehashing.  And we can add a method to hashmap.c to
re-calculate the size if we want.


In my lazy_init_name_hash() I set "disallow", do the threaded
code, and then unset "disallow" -- mainly to keep the usage
consistent with the non-threaded case.  I could just as easily
set "disallow" and leave it that way -- the question is whether
we care if the hashmap automatically resizes later.  (I don't.)
