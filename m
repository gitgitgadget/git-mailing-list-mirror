Be as blunt as you want. You're expressing an opinion, and thats fine. I
happen to think that we're right : users appear to really appreciate
this bit of the UI, and I've not yet seen any evidence of confusion
about it - though I will admit there is the possibility of that
occurring.

I think its completely ok that git and bzr have made different choices
in this regard, but I *dont* think our choice is in any regard 'totally
idiotic'.

[snip examples that are clearly predicated on how bk worked, not on how
bzr works].
