Tools -> Options -> Preferences -> E-mail Options, set "When replying t=

a message" to "Prefix each line of the original message".

Tools -> Options -> Mail Format, set "Compose in this message format" t=

"Plain Text".

Avoiding garbage is better than converting it to something useful.  If
someone wrote an Outlook mail sanitizer, I'd probably use it at work,

Yes, long ago, and thankfully I don't remember much about it.  There's
always a way to do worse -- that's small comfort.
