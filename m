I suppose this separate directory would work. When are you supposed to
take the lock, though?

When adding worktree, sure.

When managing worktrees, sure. Otherwise you would see the incomplete
worktrees.

When doing anything in git? Probably. Because otherwise you could
accidentally use the incomplete worktree. Or somebody deleting worktree
would fail removing it because you would keep adding files to it.

Isn't git supposed to allow parallel access to the repository?

As things stand if you wanted to implement worktree locking you would
need to lock the worktree for *every* operation that touches it, and
for many operations you would have to lock/unlock *all* worktrees one by
one to find the worktree you are supposed to work on.

I don't feel like adding locking to all of git to fix this problem.

Sure, adding enough locking to ensure repository consistency at all
times would be nice but it also needs to be granular enough to not harm
performance. I can't say I understand the git repository layout and
usage well enough to design that.

Thanks

Michal
