Sorry, but I don't agree, and I want to publicly state my opinion so
that Jonathan (and other bystanders on the list) knows that he is not
alone in his opinions.

I have consistently found your demeanor on the list to be very
unfriendly and difficult to work with. It is one thing to have honest
and straight talk, and another thing to be obstinate, unmindful of
feedback (both with respect to technical details, as well as to
communication styles), and disrespectful of other people.

You have accused others of assuming you make comments in bad faith.
Perhaps it is true that you are very pleasant and easy to work with in
person, but in my opinion that is not the case, at least by email. I may
be wrong, of course, and I certainly do not claim to be perfect myself.
But I find it telling that many of the list participants seem to have
had conflicts with you, and not with anyone else. So perhaps you may
want to reconsider your style of communication.

Unlike Jonathan, I would not ban you from the list. I do not believe in
censoring anybody who is not a direct and constant nuisance (like a
spammer). But personally I have a limited capacity for discussion with
you, as it seems to have a knack for going back and forth, consuming a
lot of time, and ending nowhere productive.

It is certainly your choice about how you will communicate. But likewise
it is the choice of readers and reviewers to choose how much of their
time to give to your writings.
