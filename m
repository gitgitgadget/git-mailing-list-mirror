Yeah, see my comments on the other part of the thread. If we did write
directly to a file, I think that would be enough here because git-daemon
writes this entry before running the sub-process. So by the time
ls-remote finishes, we know that it talked to upload-pack, and we know
that before upload-pack was run, git-daemon wrote the log entry. That
assumes git-daemon doesn't buffer its logs (but if it does, we should
probably fix that).
