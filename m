There seems to be some talking past each other going on.

A common problem [1] is that the apparent middle ground "B" is actually 
split two ways, (because A and C are not opposites but embed different 
ethos)

There maybe those B's who are well paid independent programmers, who are 
able to choose how to use their spare time in the same manner as those 
in "C".

And there are those who, like some of the "A"s , need some payment to 
use their hours to the benefit of Git. This will be particularly true of 
those who are not well remunerated from their independent work. If they 
are giving up precious work time then they would at least hope for a 
little acknowledgment.

To me it sounds as if Junio is thinking more of the former while David 
is thinking of the latter. These misunderstandings are difficult to 
resolve, or at least reconcile, without a proper understanding of the 
root causes of the differences.
