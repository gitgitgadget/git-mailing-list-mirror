We are conducting a research project to investigate the use of version control 
branching and merging in software development projects, and to draw 
conclusions about effective strategies and practices. These operations are 
often critical to product development, so your input will be highly valuable 
to the engineering community.

With Git's growing popularity and unique branching/merging models, we want to 
ensure feedback from its users are well represented in the data.

If you are willing to contribute, please respond to this short survey: 
http://ucalgary-cpsc.branchmerge.sgizmo.com/s3/. The survey is anonymous, 
contains 16 questions, and will take 3-8 minutes to complete.

Thank you for your assistance,
