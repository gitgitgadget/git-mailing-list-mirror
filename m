Yeah, in general I think the current system is fine. It might be
slightly more convenient to send out the update email, but finding the
right thread is more work for Junio (I guess you could just ignore that
and start a new thread, but for readers it is nice if it is connected to
the original series thread).

And I personally think it is nice to read through the whole list of
topics and their current status occasionally. I sometimes end up
commenting on a topic that I probably would not have otherwise seen that
way.  Of course, I likely have a lot more git time than most people, so
the effort of skimming "what's cooking" is not too high for me.
