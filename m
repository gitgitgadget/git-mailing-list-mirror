Nice, this seems like a clever workaround.

The more heavy-handed approach would be to just disable the JGIT prereq
when GIT_TEST_SPLIT_INDEX is in use, which would cover this and
potentially any other cases. This is nicer because it lets us continue
using the test. And it's not like we have a ton of jgit dependencies,
such that dealing with each individually would be a burden.
