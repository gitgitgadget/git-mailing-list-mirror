I use either KNode or Thunderbird with NNTP/Gmane, and I don't have
any problems when doing "Reply All" even if I forget to remove nntp-reply.
You should do reply-all anyway, because not everyone is subscribed,
and not everyone uses nntp-ml.

For some strange reason Thunderbird used as NNTP reader does not
screw up with whitespace, while Thunderbird used as email client does.
Al least it did last time I forgot to create new email in its NNTP reader.

Note that git-format-patch has Thunderbird subsection in the
"MUA specific hints" section.

Inline are preferred over attachment because it is easier to review
and comment on online patches. Anyway, it is the same amount of
steps, and git-am preserves commit message.

I think you can save-all on the whole thread...
