All right, this is good argument... though inconsistency (assuming
that we don't switch to separate test for multi-file filter) could
be argument against.

Though I wonder if test preparation could be extracted into a
common function...

All right, so it is here to test multiple files (and that filter
actually process multiple files).

With each test in separate repository we could copy test.r prepared
in 'setup' into test1.r in each of multi-file tests.

This test was required because of %f to pass filename as parameter
coupled with the fact that we use `clean` and `smudge` as shell
script fragment (so e.g. pipes and redirection would work in
one-shot filter definition).

This is not the case with multi-file filter, where filenames are
passed internally, and we don't need to worry about shell quoting
at all.

This would test... example parser.  Well, all right, better not
give problems for Windows.

But... you can create such files in Git Bash:

  $ touch "$(echo -n -e "fo=o\nbar\n")"

and though they look strange

  $ ls -1 fo*
  'fo=o'$'\n''bar'

but work all right

  $ echo "strangest" >>"$(echo -n -e "fo=o\nbar\n")"
  $ name="$(echo -n -e "fo=o\nbar\n")"
  $ cat "$name"
  strangest

Right, we test that we processed full file this way, in the multi
packet test.

If we are testing that if there is no "smudge" capability, then
there were no "smudge" operations, why we don't test just that:
that grepping for "smudge" in long doesn't find anything.

Current version feels convoluted (and would stop working if Git
is improved to not run "clean" in this case for optimization).

All right, it runs for more files, but does it cover different
code paths?  If not, it only makes test run longer...

All right (perhaps comment for future would be good idea, though).

All right.

In one case *.file is expanded by shell, then expansion passed
as parameters to `git add` (perhaps not on MS Windows); in the
other '*.file' is passed as pattern to `git add` and expanded
by Git itself (this might be case for both patterns on Win).

But this doesn't matter here, anyway. I think.

This is better.

"process filter aborting stops processing of all further files", maybe?

All right, good enough.

y/// and tr/// are the same operator.  Though y/// is supposedly
more Perl-ish, and I think it is used more in Git tests (or rather
it functions).

All right.  And the lines gets too long.
