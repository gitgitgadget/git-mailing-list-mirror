I'm afraid smudge/clean are not a good match for your use case:
smudge can do anything that clean removes again, i.e.: if you smudge a
blob, then clean it, it has to be the same blob.

Your smudge filter seems to give different results for the same blob
depending on other variables (your .conf), but git doesn't care as long
as clean output is the same. Also, git cannot possibly know when "it is
time" to rerun smudge.

Maybe "source"-ing .conf files would be an alternative approach for you,
or using hooks?

Cheers
Michael
