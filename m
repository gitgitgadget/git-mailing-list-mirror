Errr... what? multi_packet_read() is the current name...

True.  

BTW. this means that it cannot share code with fetch / push codebase,
where Git spools from pkt-line to packfile on disk.

Well, if current code doesn't have such check, then I think it would
be all right to not have it either.

Note that we do not use C++ comments.

The usual case is 0 for success, but -1 (and not 1) for error.
But I agree with Peff that keeping existing API is better.

Yes, and we cannot keep the naming convention.  Though maybe mentioning
the equivalence in the comment above function would be good idea...

That's better, I think.

Well, no need to reorder parameters.  Better keep it the same as for
other function.  'src' is input ('source'), 'src_in' is tautologic.

Sorry for being so cryptic.  What I meant is to think about adding comments
describing new functions just above them.

Right, because filter output goes to Git via strbuf.

Well, git code is not always the best example...

All right, we could always refactor to avoid code duplication later.

What I wanted to ask was not "what it does?",
but "why we need to flush here?".

I don't know what you want to refer to.  The linked email explains
why we fork/start_async() Git process, and the answer was to support
streaming.

There isn't anything there about why protocol v2 requires sequential /
synchronous processing of file output, that is write file contents in
full, then read, instead of having child write, and Git read and ready
to read (so filter driver can start writing immediately, and do not need
to wait for the other ed to stop writing / finish file).
