Thanks so much Elijah for your eye-opening response. Thus far I was both
naive and ignorant about the complexity of the matter, and also never
asked the question as to why it wasn't tackled earlier since it came up
already.

Since so many areas of git are affected by precious files, it seems that
rolling it out with everything working is unrealistic and I wonder if
it even had to be behind a feature toggle at first.

A particularly interesting question brought up here also was the question
of what's more important: untracked files, or precious files? Are they
effectively treated the same, or is there a difference?

In any case, it seems easiest to set the desired syntax for such a
feature and/or validate it, and then devise a plan for how it could all
come together.
