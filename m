My apologies - this patch series should be applied to the 'next'
branch.Â  It applies cleanly on top of
b46fe60e1d ("merge-fix/ps/test-chmtime-get", 2018-04-20), which
is a commit in the 'next' branch.

Good points. The intention with this logic is that any entries
that *could* go into an index are allocated from the memory
pool. The "transient" entries only exist for a short period of
time. These have a defined lifetime and we can always trace the
corresponding "free" call. make_transient_cache_entry() is only
used to construct a temporary cache_entry to pass to the
checkout_entry() / write_entry(). There is a note in checkout.c
indicating that write_entry() needs to be re-factored to not take
a cache_entry.

The cache_entry type could gain knowledge about where it was
allocated from. This would allow us to only have a
single "free()" function, which could inspect the cache_entry to
see if it was allocated from a mem_pool (and possibly which
mem_pool) and take the appropriate action. The downside of this
approach is that cache_entry would need to gain a field to track
this information, and I *think* all of the bit field spots are
taken.
