OK. My initial reaction was "eh, who care? execve() failing is only one
error mode, and we might see all kinds of failure modes from a missing
or broken pager".

But this:

...shows what happens in those other cases, and you are making things
more consistent. So that seems reasonable to me.

Yeah, the point of f7991f01f2 was just to clean up the tests. The
modification was only documenting what Git happened to do for that case
now, and not meant as an endorsement of the behavior. ;) So I have no
problem changing it.

OK. I would also be happy to see it go. The crash was about reusing the
pager child_process struct, and no we know that cannot happen. Either we
run the pager or we immediately bail. I think that the code change in
that commit could also be reverted (to always re-init the child
process), but it's probably more defensive to keep it.
