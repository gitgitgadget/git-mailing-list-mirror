If there are a small number of distinct problems (that each have many
instances), I'm not opposed to having a mode to suppress them in the
resulting diff, so we can see the other problems more clearly.  Of
course, just fixing them is even better. ;)

The first one sounds like it may be a candidate for suppressing (i.e.,
it's not necessarily an actual problem).
