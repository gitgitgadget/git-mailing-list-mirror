These all look fine to me. The commit messages all made perfect sense to
me, but it sounds like some people weren't aware of the new
post-076aa2cbda rules. So maybe it makes sense to reference that even in
the earlier commits, and to explicitly say that it's safe to convert
even in the case where the lock_file goes out of scope while still
active.

The only dangerous thing left to check for is anybody holding onto a
pointer-to-lockfile. The only such pointer declared outside of a
parameter list is in create_reflock(), and there it's just to
temporarily coerce a void pointer. So unless somebody is doing something
really tricky (putting a pointer-to-lock in a "void *"), I think these
conversions all have to be trivially correct (famous last words...).
