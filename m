Well if it should be official for git, Linus has to "bless" it imho.

Well, yes. I would like something, which has something to do with the original 
linux mascot.

Like a fish (though that is already used by some other projects) - penguins 
like fish! (Tux too? Or more Linus' fingers ;)? )

Or perhaps even a wife for Tux, which helps him organizing and managing?

... Tux & Git having nice holidays on an island? ...

Hm, but what is cogito then ...
