Looks obviously correct.

Yeah, if we're not worried about the performance implications of the
extra allocation, I think it's better to err on the side of safety.

I do agree that if we consistently passed an array (and length), some of
these functions would get less awkward. I tried a few years ago to
convert many of the commit_list uses to arrays, but it was a bit of a
yak shave, since often they get lists from callers, who get it from
rev_info, etc. And some of those callers _do_ like having lists, because
they want to do O(1) splicing, etc.
