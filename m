Oh, sorry, I didn't realize that was the sticking point. No, sadly I
don't think there is any way to feed a direct oid to clone currently.
Clone does know how to end up on a detached HEAD (e.g., if you specify a
tag with "--branch"). IMHO that would be a useful feature to learn, but
I think most folks resort to init+fetch, since it's most often useful in
scripted situations (like CI) anyway.
