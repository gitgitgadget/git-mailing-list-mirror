GitHub is organizing another Git Merge conference this coming April in
New York City, USA. The organizers have offered to host a developer's
summit similar to what we did last year in Paris (one day, developers
sitting around chatting).

The venue has not been booked yet, and they've asked for input before
doing so.  Specifically, they need a rough headcount to book something
of the appropriate size. So I'd like to get a list of people who are
potentially interested in coming (you can respond here, or email me
off-list). This isn't a commitment, so don't be afraid to say you're
interested if you're not sure yet. But at the same time, be realistic. :)

In the past we've more or less limited attendance to people involved in
the development of Git, alternate implementations (e.g., JGit, libgit2),
and surrounding tools (e.g., I'd welcome discussion about distributed
code review systems built around git). If you're not sure if you'd be
welcome, please ask (here, or feel free to email me off-list).

If you need or want money to help with travel expenses, it's possible
that GitHub or the Git project itself may be able to help out. There's
nothing particularly organized yet, but if you are interested, you can
either email me or the Git project committee (<git@sfconservancy.org>).
I think we'll need to see how many requests there are before we have a
sense of how many can be filled (but in past years, there have not been
many requests, so please don't be shy because you think we're
overburdened).

All of the details are open for discussion, including the attendance
policy and Git project policy for doling out money. The format in years
past has been mostly unconference, and centered around round-table
discussions. I've asked for more round-table style seating (as opposed
to theater-style for presentations). There will probably be a projector.
I've also asked to have a developer's dinner (last year there was an
ad-hoc thing, but I thought it might be easier if somebody organized it
in advance).

Let me know if there are additional requests. It's early still, but some
things are easier to accommodate earlier than later. And if anybody is
interested in organizing any part of it (e.g., figuring out the dinner
ourselves rather than leaving it to GitHub organizers), let me know.

I hope to see people there!
