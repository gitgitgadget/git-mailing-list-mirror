Ah I see, it's a function.  Unfortunately POSIX requires
shell functions to have the variable assignment properties
of special built-ins.  So

	X=value func

has the same properties as

	X=value :

In other words, the value assigned to X (and any subsequent
values assigned within the function) persists after the call.
Also, the variable X is not exported unless it's already been
exported.

This is pretty lame but it's how the original Korn shell did
things and POSIX has adopted that.  Bash's POSIX mode tries
to balance things by both making the value persist and exporting
X.  Unfortunately this is buggy too as it causes X to continue
to be exported after the function returns.

So the bottom-line is that your patch is the correct solution
after all :)

Cheers,
