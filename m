Guys,

The freedesktop.org git pages are woefully out of date.

I'm looking at these pages for example:

    http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Infrastructure/git/UIFlaws
    http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Infrastructure/git/Developers

They seem very pre-1.5-ish to me...

Can anyone here influence their update?
Or should a fd.o bug against the wiki be submitted?

Anyone know?

Thanks,
jdl

PS -- Yeah, I know we kinda had this discussion a little
      bit ago, but nothing came from it, apparently.
