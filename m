Well, here's one I know Dan researched..

The fact that you don't like the man, and that he's more critical than 
over-the-top enthusiastic, hey. That doesn't make him unprofessional or 
mean that he has no journalistic integrity. Being critical is way too 
seldom seen, and as you admit, Lyons is by no means one-sidedly critical. 

So maybe his glass is half full. Still no reason to dismiss him.

Hey, he's been vilified by some of those blogs. Unnecessarily, I say.

Yes. And when trying to clear it with IBM legal, Greg KH was told not to 
talk to Dan Lyons.

What naïve school did you go through where journalists aren't idealistic 
puppies with an agenda?

The fact is, they all have their biases. The fact that open source tends 
to strike a chord with them and they almost universally end up 
understanding about freedom of the GPL kind is usually a big help. The 
fact that some have other biases don't make them worse journalists. It 
just means that you see different kinds of stories from them.
