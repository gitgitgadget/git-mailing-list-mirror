While in theory 'B' and 'C' might look equivalent, IMHO in practice
there is a clear distinction between the two. It's commonly known that
Git refers to 'B' as the 'first parent' of 'D'. Git also provides means
to identify such first parents via 'git log --first-parent'.

A fun fact about first parents is that, unless Linus is on vacation
and hands over his responsibilities to GKH, you will be quite
confident that 'git log --first-parent linux/master' will list
stuff committed by Linus himself. That's why (I bet) in the minds
of people involved in Linux development, the diagram looks like:

    D
    | \
    B  C
    | /
    A

IMHO the fact that 'A' is the parent of 'C' (IOW 'C' has an appropriate
base version) is mostly important to achieve an effortless merge of 'C'
and later on loses its major significance. So, I would say that
(contents-wise) the diagram can be further reduced to:

    D
    | \
    B  D^2
    |
    A

Just visually, a sane backporting order looks A, B an D^2 (A is assumed
non-merge and D is skipped, since cherry picking merges is not common).

I am quite sure people have thought about backporting techniques and
strategies long before I started to ask these questions. So, I am
still looking forward to seeing various experiences shared.
