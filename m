I just stumbled across this freedesktop.org site from 2007-06-03:
http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Infrastructure/git/UIFlaws

It seems to me that since then most of the issues have been worked out.
Are any of them still valid points? If so, which ones and how should we
go about addressing them?

Jakub Cc'd as he was the last one to edit the (now immutable) wiki page.
