Very good point.  I myself am trying to justify flying to Eclipse
Summit Europe in November.  Its a long flight from the west coast
of the US.

He sometimes makes trips to DC for some reason or another.  But maybe
October he was thinking of the GSoC mentor summit?  Its held here in
Mountain View, CA.  Not too far from Portland, relatively speaking.
But if he's here in October I'm not sure he'd want to be here again
in say November.  Not enough time between flights to stretch the
legs out again.  ;-)
