I get the blame for that.  I think I originally added it, and then you made 
exactly the point you make below about it being an unreliable method for 
keeping track of outstanding items and I found I couldn't disagree.

My own recommendation for this page - or in fact any similar list - is don't 
bother - let's delete it or replace it with a link to Junio's email.

The way to get new features into git seems to be either
 a. Do it yourself
 b. Mention it (but not excessively) on the mailing list, if one of the guru's
    is interested enough to do it (their choice not yours), then you're in.  
    Otherwise - see (a).

I thought I'd included only serious suggestions.  Perhaps my humour-detector 
was a bit faulty that day.
