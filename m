If you are student who is considering applying for Google Summer of
Code 2009... please submit at least a draft proposal sooner rather
than later.  You can still update it after submission, but you need
to submit a proposal to be considered.

Remember the deadline is April 3rd 19:00 UTC (this Saturday),
and a deadline extension isn't likely.
