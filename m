Thanks for digging, I didn't look beyond that single line.

Yikes. It looks like this slipped by on the tests because we always
check "< 0" in the callers, not non-zero. So success would not look like
failure, but failure would look like success. And write failure does not
happen regularly in the test suite.

So this looks correct, and well-explained.

I'm not sure I deserve a reported-by if I say "it looks fine" but am
totally wrong. ;)
