In newer Thunderbirds, you can mark / select a text, and when you hit 
reply, it (and only that) will be quoted - called selective quote. You 
can press Ctrl-A (for Select All) before hitting reply, and the inline 
attachment will be included in the quote.

Please be sure to also cite the pref change I mentioned above as 
alternative.

Hey now!

I hope you realize that Netscape / Mozilla had a really important role 
in making the Internet popular in the public in the first place (the 
alternatives were AOL and CompuServe back then), and that Mozilla is 
*the* most-used Open Source application. In fact, Firefox' market share 
on Windows made a large contribution to Linux, by convincing web sites 
authors to not assume IE, which is a big reason why Linux is usable at 
all. Imagine the web or email was only usable with IE or Outlook...
</diversion>

I use Linux myself everywhere, and recommend it to many people, and I 
think it's technically excellent.

BTW: I want to use this occasion to thank all you Linux programmers for 
your awesome, technically superiour work. Thanks a lot, and keep it up! :-)
