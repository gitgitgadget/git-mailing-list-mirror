To be clear, nobody has generated a sha1 collision in Git yet, and you
cannot blindly use the shattered PDFs to do so. Git's notion of the
SHA-1 of an object include the header, so somebody would have to do a
shattered-level collision search for something that starts with the
correct "blob 1234\0" header.

So we don't actually know how Git would behave in the face of a SHA-1
collision. It would be pretty easy to simulate it with something like:

---
diff --git a/block-sha1/sha1.c b/block-sha1/sha1.c
