I am still planning on doing this.  Since it took them several months
to get back and as you point out, while they're down links go bad all
over the place, I am planning on owning the wiki so we can have more
control over it.  I also want to make it easier to contribute to it
and have it be Git backed.  This is a project on my to-do list.
