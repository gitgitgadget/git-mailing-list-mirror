Hi Jonathan,

From looking through that log.gz (without having a clue where the test
code lives, so I cannot say what it is supposed to do, and also: this is
the first time I hear about dgit...), it would appear that this must be a
regression in the reflog messages produced by `git rebase`.

It ends thusly:

-- snip --
[...]
+ git reflog
+ egrep 'debrebase new-upstream.*checkout'
+ test 1 = 0
+ t-report-failure
+ set +x
TEST FAILED
-- snap --

Which makes me think that the reflog we produce in *some* code path that
originally called `git checkout` differs from the scripted rebase's
generated reflog.

Right. And there are a few weeks before the holidays, which should give me
time to fix whatever bugs are discovered (I only half mind being the only
one who fixes these bugs).

In this instance, I am more a fan of the "let's move fast and break
things, then move even faster fixing them" approach.

Besides, the bug that Ã†var discovered was a bug already in the scripted
rebase, but hidden by yet another bug (the missing error checking).

I get the pretty firm impression that the common code paths are now pretty
robust, and only lesser-exercised features may expose a bug (or
regression, as in the case of the reflogs, where one could argue that the
exact reflog message is not something we promise not to fiddle with).

Ciao,
Dscho
