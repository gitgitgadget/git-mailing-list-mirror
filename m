I'd be curious how you'd do that. We can wrap the function and redirect
its stderr, but you'd still get a crufty line invoking the inner
function (plus the outer function). That's better than seeing the inner
details, but not as nice as just seeing the outer function invocation.

I don't think we can play games like the one we do in test_eval_(),
because "set -x" will already be on.
