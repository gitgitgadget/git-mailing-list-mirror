Yeah, it definitely would be worth mentioning. I'm still undecided on
whether we want to be endorsing struct assignment more fully.

I had that thought, too, but I think the 4-way rules are necessary,
because the transformations aren't the same in each case. E.g., for the
four cases, the resulting assignments are:

    (dst, src): dst = src;
   (dst, *src): dst = *src;
   (*dst, src): *dst = src;
  (*dst, *src): *dst = *src;

For pointer-to-pointer, I assumed the tool would handle that
automatically by matching "T" as "T*". Though if that is the case, I
think "(dst, src)" and "(*dst, *src)" would be equivalent (though of
course our rule matches are different, as you do not memcpy the raw
structs).
