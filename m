Good reasoning. I've definitely been bit by this before when manually
testing something (for some reason, I still haven't trained my fingers
to type "test-tool foo" instead of "test-foo").

A similar one that bites me sometimes is that modern t5801 will fail
with an old built version of git-remote-testgit. That one _is_ correctly
handled in .gitignore, but you do have to remember to run "git clean".
But that's the best we can do, I think, unless we want to make t5801
more paranoid about running the version from t/t5801/git-remote-testgit.

Sounds like the right solution, and the patch looks good to me.
