This is actually a bit more complicated. The "--merged" check in 'git 
tag' uses a different mechanism to detect which tags are reachable. It 
uses a revision walk starting at the "merge commit" (master in your 
case) and all tags with the "limited" option (to ensure the walk happens 
during prepare_revision_walk()) but marks the merge commit as 
UNINTERESTING. The limit_list() method stops when all commits are marked 
UNINTERESTING - minus some "slop" related to the commits that start the 
walk.

One important note: the set of tags is important here. If you add a new 
tag to the root commit (git tag MyTag a2d71961f) then the walk succeeds 
by ensuring it walks until MyTag. This gets around the clock skew issue. 
There may be other more-recent tags with a clock-skew issue, but since 
Pacemaker-0.6.0 is the oldest tag, that requires the walk to continue 
until at least that date.

The commit-walk machinery in revision.c is rather complicated, and is 
used for a lot of different reasons, such as "git log" and this 
application in "git tag". It is on my list to refactor this code to use 
the commit-graph and generation numbers, but as we can see by this 
example, it is not easy to tease out what is happening in the code.

In a world where generation numbers are expected to be available, we 
could rewrite do_merge_filter() in ref-filter.c to call into 
paint_down_to_common() in commit.c using the new "min_generation" 
marker. By assigning the tags to be in the "twos" list and the merge 
commit in the "one" commit, we can check if the tags have the PARENT1 
flag after the walk in paint_down_to_common(). Due to the static nature 
of paint_down_to_common(), we will likely want to abstract this into an 
external method in commit.c, say can_reach_many(struct commit *from, 
struct commit_list *to).

The work in ds/generation-numbers is focused on the "git tag --contains" 
method, which does return correctly here (it is the reverse of the 
--merged condition):

Which tags can reach Pacemaker-0.6.1?

$ git tag --contains Pacemaker-0.6.1
(returns a big list)

This is the actual reverse lookup (which branches contain this tag?)

$ git branch --contains Pacemaker-0.6.1 | grep master
* master

These commands work despite clock skew. The commit-graph feature makes 
them faster.

Thanks,
