Almost agree, except for shops where you have an enforced encoding that 
you cannot easily change.

And last time I checked, many more encodings used 1 character/byte (or for 
that matter, 1 column / byte) than not; utf8_width would be "more wrong" 
than strlen() here, because strlen() would "happen to work" here.

There _has_ to be a way to check if the current author string is encoded 
in UTF-8.  All I am asking is that the original poster would put just a 
_little_ more effort into the issue and make the thing dependent on the 
knowledge -- as opposed to the assumption -- that the author is encoded in 
UTF-8.

That is the code that barfs in wcwidth:

        if (ch < 32 || (ch >= 0x7f && ch < 0xa0))
                return -1;

That is not a big problem, but Geoff's code does not handle that case 
correctly.  For example, in Code-page 437, a name like "Б№ычу" would 
result in a negative width.

But hey, it is definitely not my itch, I will never suffer from the 
fallout of this patch, as I am safely within US-ASCII.  I just thought I 
saw a potential problem and a possible way out.  That's it.

Ciao,
Dscho
