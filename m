Having just read that script, it is blindly looking at "*.txt", so...as
long as that is what your script is doing (and it looks like the version
in pu is), I don't think there's any reason to get more complicated. The
only difference is that build-docdep does not even bother looking in
subdirectories (maybe it should, since we now build stuff in technical,
I think).
