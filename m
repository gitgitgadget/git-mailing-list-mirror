I don't think it's the end of the world to do it in patch 2, as long as
we end up in a good spot. But IMHO it's really hard for reviewers to
understand what is going on, because it's intermingled with so many
other changes. It would be much easier to read if we had a preparatory
patch that switched the memory ownership of the field, and then built on
top of that.

But I recognize that sometimes that's hard to do, because the state is
so tangled that the functional change is what untangles it. I'm not sure
if that's the case here or not; you'd probably have a better idea as
somebody who looked carefully at it recently.

Ah, I see. I was confused by looking for a free of an extra_headers
field. We have rev_info.extra_headers, and that is _not_ owned by
rev_info. We used to assign that to a variable in
log_write_email_headers(), but now we actually make a copy of it. And so
the copy is freed in that function when we replace it with a version
containing extra mime headers here:

                  strbuf_addf(&subject_buffer,
                           "%s"
                           "MIME-Version: 1.0\n"
                           "Content-Type: multipart/mixed;"
                           " boundary=\"%s%s\"\n"
                           "\n"
                           "This is a multi-part message in MIME "
                           "format.\n"
                           "--%s%s\n"
                           "Content-Type: text/plain; "
                           "charset=UTF-8; format=fixed\n"
                           "Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\n\n",
                           extra_headers ? extra_headers : "",
                           mime_boundary_leader, opt->mime_boundary,
                           mime_boundary_leader, opt->mime_boundary);
                  free((char *)extra_headers);
                  extra_headers = strbuf_detach(&subject_buffer, NULL);

But the actual ownership is passed out via the extra_headers_p variable,
and that is what is assigned to ctx.after_subject (which now takes
ownership).

I think in the snippet I quoted above that extra_headers could never be
NULL now, right? We'll always return at least an empty string. But
moreover, we are formatting it into a strbuf, only to potentially copy
it it another strbuf. Couldn't we just do it all in one strbuf?

Something like this:

The resulting code is shorter and (IMHO) easier to understand. It
avoids an extra allocation and copy when using mime. It also avoids the
allocation of an empty string when opt->extra_headers and
opt->pe_headers are both NULL. It does make an extra copy when
extra_headers is non-NULL but pe_headers is NULL (and you're not using
MIME), as we could just use opt->extra_headers as-is, then. But since
the caller needs to take ownership, we can't avoid that copy.

I think you could even do this cleanup before adding pe_headers,
especially if it was coupled with cleaning up the memory ownership
issues.
