Many people who are using Apple computers choose to use Macports or Homebrew to install their packages, which makes this a moot point. Additionally, XCode 4 provides Git as well.

One thing to consider is that people who truly don't understand what kind of machine they are on, and are incapable of figuring out how to do so, are going to have an extremely difficult time using it.

That isn't to say it shouldn't be addressed, Bazaar, and Mercurial both seem to provide an easy installation medium.
