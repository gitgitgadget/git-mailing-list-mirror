Interesting point; if extending this syntax anyway, any treeish ought to
work, not just a committish.

True, but that seems quite inconvenient.

Only if the gitlink points to a commit that doesn't exist in the same
repository.  A gitlink can point to a commit you already have.

It seems as visible as the standard commit:path syntax; the second colon
seems just as visible as the first.  :/ already has a different meaning
(text search), so that would introduce inconsistency.

I stand corrected; I didn't find that.  I thought rev parsing worked
independently from the repository, and didn't have any automagic
detection based on the contents of the repository?

This seems ambiguous, and (AFAICT) not documented.  If HEAD:A and B both
refer to a commit, in addition to the blob A..B, which will HEAD:A..B
refer to?  I did test the HEAD:gitlink..anotherbranch case, and it does
parse as a range.
