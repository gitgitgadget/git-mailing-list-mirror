It is quite artificial in presentation at least. There's no motivating
explanation of what is being attempted just before-and-after diagrams
along with a command that achieves the result. That presentation makes
it very hard to learn how to usefully use the command from the
description.

I think Jakub's explanations do a much better job of explaining
something someone might actually want to do and then showing how to do
it. So if there's redundancy I'd vote for dropping the old stuff.

Meanwhile, while we're talking about git-rebase documentation, the
recent posts about the:

	git rebase --onto <foo> <upstream> <branch>

form take advantage of the fact that this command also changes the
current branch to <branch>. I think that's quite surprising behavior,
(though useful in the example that was given). It's perhaps out of
line with the scope of git-rebase but it should at least be
documented. I think that will need some specific mention before the
examples.
