I think it may depend on your workload. Open-addressing generally uses a
tombstone, so you're still dealing with the "deleted" entries until the
next table resize. I suspect that's fine in most cases, but I also am
sure you could find a benchmark that favors the chained approach (I
think in most cases we actually never delete at all -- we simply fill up
a table and then eventually clear it).

FWIW, it's not just you. ;)

Yeah, that seems weird. You'd want to include one from the other to make
sure that they both match.

By the way, if you do want to pursue changes, I have no problem at all
hacking up khash into something that can't be merged with its upstream.
It's nice that it's a well-used and tested library, but I'd much rather
have something that we on this project understand (and that matches our
conventions and style).

Yes, much nicer, and the khash change wasn't too painful.
