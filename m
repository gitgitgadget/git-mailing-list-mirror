I actually had a case[1] yesterday where it seems like oidset is a fair
bit slower than oid_array for a large set.

But:

  - loading the skiplist into memory has pretty lousy performance
    anyway. If we really care about performance of large lists, we
    should define a sorted on-disk format that can be mmap'd and
    searched directly.  Or if people are willing to tolerate false
    positives, even a bloom filter.

    I've never really used a big skiplist myself, so I haven't done any
    work towards those things.

  - we could probably improve the speed of oidset. Two things I notice
    about its implementation:

      - it has to malloc for each entry, which I suspect is the main
	bottleneck. We could probably pool-allocate blocks, and when
	entries get removed just leave the allocations in place until we
	clear(). Most callers tend to build up a set and then query it a
	lot, or possibly remove items from the set until it's empty. But
	my guess is that few or none want a long-lived set that they add
	and remove from randomly.

      - insertion lets you do check-and-insert as a single operation
	(something I failed to notice in [1]). But it's not implemented
	as efficiently as it could be, since the "contains" and "put"
	operations do separate lookups. This doesn't matter for a set
	that's queried a lot more, but for something like de-duping
	(like I was doing in [1]) most operations are check-and-insert.

Most of that is just food for thought, but it possibly argues that we
should not care about performance characteristics for swapping out
oid_array and oidset here (i.e., that your patch is fine, and the
simplicity benefit is the most important thing).

    but note that it's buried pretty deep.

Again, I didn't see anything wrong with the patch itself.
