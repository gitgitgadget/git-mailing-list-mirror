Is their also an option to also add an option to `git clone` to (re)set
the default branch name offered by the upstream to that provided?

Alternatively provide a `--no-checkout` option for the clone so that
either no actual checkout is performed, or maybe that a detached head
checkout is performed so that users can name their default branch
appropriately.

In some cases a true --no-checkout may be the 'best' thing to do to
avoid the user mental model confusion about needing to have a local
branch matching an upstream branch before they can start their work on
top of it (hopefully with a fresh branch name).
