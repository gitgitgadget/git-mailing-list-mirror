I think s/would have been/would be/1, but I am not native English
speaker.

First, the name is SZEDER GÃ¡bor.

Second, it would be nice to have some specific examples, like for
example the results of running `git merge-base --is-ancestory` in
specific repository, and from specific starting point.

It might be good idea to also show performance change for a command
that handles large amount of commits but does not use the commit-graph,
like for example `git gc`.

Would it be possible to show profiling results?

What operating system do you use?

All right.  It should be not a problem to rebase series on top of
different implementation of [inline-able] helper function if it
turns out that the move to slab serious affects negatively performance.

Should we store offsets and corrected commit date on the slab,
or just the corrected date (with offset applied)?  We should be
using corrected commit date only; offset can be recomputed if
needed, e.g. when writing the commit-graph.
