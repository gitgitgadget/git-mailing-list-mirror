Yeah, so I think the new code should be an improvement there, because it
will eventually retry the write when the buffer fills, or when we
eventually flush on close (my "everything written by the time we hit
fflush()" in the previous mail really should have been "...by the time
we hit fclose()").  Maybe another reason to use stdio. :)

The original also doesn't handle "real" errors at all (stuff besides
EINTR, etc). Nor does the rewrite. I guess it's unlikely to see a write
error here that doesn't also involve pack-objects returning a non-zero
exit code.
