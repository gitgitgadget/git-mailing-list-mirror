Hi Idan,

please only write public mails when discussing Open Source.

The top-posting is actually not auto-generated at all. It is your decision
to write on top of the quoted text, or not.

You probably also saw the note that this is an Open Source project, where
that support is handled by volunteers. You did not pay anything, after
all.

You know, replies like these I could do without. I do try to help. I even
explain to you why your replies are met with such hostility, and how you
could avoid that in the future. And what do I get in return?

That is your choice, of course. You will have to live with the choices
Stefan and I make on our end, too.
