Thanks, I meant to mention the rounding thing but forgot. I didn't know
about either of those macros, though.

I thought at first you meant real EWAH bitmaps. But those aren't random
access (so you have to read them into an uncompressed bitmap in memory,
which is why ewah/bitmap.c exists). But if you just mean reusing those
bitmaps, then yeah, possibly.

It looks like it's using a commit slab, though. If you know the number
of bits you need up front, then the commit slab can do it without any
waste. I didn't dig enough to see if that's what it's doing or not.
