Hmm, I tried the following:

     GIT_PAGER='less -R -F -X -c -y0'

In my environment (Xfce), the result after scrolling the output of "git 
log -p" up and down a bit was about 20 copies of the same screen "page" 
in the scrollback, plus a couple of blank "pages".  Not good, 
unfortunately, and actually much worse than having just "-R -F -X".

Does the GIT_PAGER setup, as I described it above, work for you without 
the described artifacts, in any of the environments you have access to?

When you get into the terminfo entry definitions, the root cause is that 
the terminal initialization sequences contain switching to alternate 
screen, which causes screen contents to be lost when less(1) exits.  
Thus, "-X" has been actually abused in the pager setups to skip the 
terminal initialization sequences, which may also result in other 
issues.

One of the solutions is to edit the terminfo entry manually and remove 
the escape codes that cause the switching to and from alternate screen, 
which I tested, but that also introduced another issue -- the screen 
contents was always present after less(1) exited, which isn't always the 
desired behavior.

Please test the "--redraw-on-quit" option, so far it's the best 
available solution, IMHO.

Quite frankly, I think that such a solution would be like "fixing the 
fix, which is actually an abuse", as I described it above, eventually 
introducing even more issues, instead of solving the original issue.

Please test the "--redraw-on-quit" option, AFAICT that's all we need 
(plus the already mentioned other improvements to less(1), to avoid the 
version-dependent workarounds), and the distributions will eventually 
catch up with the newer versions of less(1).  If the whole thing has 
worked for decades as-is, it can continue working that way for a year or 
two until the packages get updated.

There's actually no two-way mailing list for less(1), the entire project 
is pretty much a one-man show, so to speak.  There's a GitHub page that 
allows issues to be submitted, but I didn't use that, so I exchanged a 
few private email messages instead with the author.  I've already summed 
up the important parts of those messages.
