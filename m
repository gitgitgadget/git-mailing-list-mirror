Great - I've put these all up on the wiki along with GitTorrent, and
noted Julian Phillips as a possible mentor for the git-svnserver.  I'll
again point out that I wrote a plan for this effort at
http://utsl.gen.nz/git/git-svnserver.txt - though that may be becoming
more and more irrelevant.

=46unnily enough, I'm actually a possible /student/ this year - I'm
studying full-time this year - not in Computer Science, but hey that's
not a requirement ;-), and perhaps finishing my GitTorrent
implementation in my breaks would be a nice way to earn US$5k.  It woul=
d
be contrary to all of the "goals" of the programme=B9, bar the first.  =
I'd
have to get the work done on a slightly different schedule because of
the hemispherical term difference... but possible.  Would this be an
abuse of the programme.  I leave the moral question open to the list; I
can easily find paid contracting work over the time anyway.  But this
would be *fun* :-)

Sam.
