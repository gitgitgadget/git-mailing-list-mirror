The ideas page is very important. Git needs a good set of ideas on its
ideas page in order to be accepted. Google has stated this many times
in the past, its a key part of the decision making process (not the
only part, but an important part nonetheless).

We should have a good ideas page by the application deadline, so that
when Google goes to review applications, they can at least make a fair
assessment of our ideas list.
