Yeah, I think it is just optimizing out the variable entirely. If
RUNTIME_PREFIX isn't defined (and it's not for non-Windows platforms)
then we never look at the variable at all, and it's a dead assignment.
And the compiler can see that easily because it's got static linkage. So
it drops the variable completely, but it can't drop the call to
xstrdup() with the information in exec_cmd.c. It has to call the
function and throw away the result, resulting in the leak.

In fact, the whole extract_argv0_path thing is pointless without
RUNTIME_PREFIX. So I think one reasonable fix is just:

diff --git a/exec_cmd.c b/exec_cmd.c
