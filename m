I was more coming at the question from the other direction, that is,
about accessing, normally, the git manuals, and discovering the desired
information, both for existing and new users.

In your example, you needed to include the extra -w option, specific to
this 'special' manual, while all the other hundreds of man pages would
be accessed without it (even on Windows, as the config is set by default).

I also get the impression that many linux users may be using 'man' just
as much as much as 'git help' but neither (without realising the need
for the extra option) would show the user-manual (.txt|.html).

We do have the advised `git help -g` to list the concept guides, but
that doesn't advise about the user-manual, which surely we should
mention to those asking for help (without them needing a long journey of
discovery). The list does include `git everyday`...

I appreciate that, for some, there is a view that new users are other
peoples problems and that knowledgable users already know, roughly,Â 
which command they wish to use and thus then peruse the appropriate
reference manual to confirm the correct form for their command. I'd
rather we direct uncertain users to their appropriate guide quickly,
using their expected viewer method. Hence the question.
