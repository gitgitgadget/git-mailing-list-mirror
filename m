Oh, mine was not a criticism but was just an observation.

Maybe the folks we consider as "git community members" are either too
narrow, or too detached from the "real user community", and it could be
that git books are better written without us.

I am not being sarcastic nor sardonic; we may simply be too close to git,
we may have been breathing git for too long, and what feels the most
natural thing to be taught first for us may not be the best first thing to
be taught to the new people (even though they may eventually grow to think
like we do when they become proficient enough).
