I think you are confusing "checked into version control" with
"distributed with release tarballs". Most projects do not do the
former[1], but almost all (including git) do the latter.

This discussion is about things checked into the repository.

[1] Sorry, I don't have exact numbers, but I have never encountered this
before.

I'm not aware of any auto-generated files that are checked in. Can you
give an example?

> * people are used to being able to do "./configure; make; make install"

Right. They do it from the release tarball. Getting the version straight
from source-control usually means you have to have autoconf if you want
to run it.

Yes, it does. Having generated files in your source repository means:

  - you generate useless noise commits when those files are
    re-autogenerated

  - developers must make sure that they are not accidentally committing
    auto-generated cruft that have nothing to do with their actual
    changes
