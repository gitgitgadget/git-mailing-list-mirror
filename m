Could we just save the first element of the original argv for that
purpose? Or alternatively, use the first stored element in the
command list?

Indeed, printing the command that the user called is a better message
than the command that is the entry-point of the loop. I'll change it
in v4.

As the string-list has its own counter, I guess the done_alias variable
can be reverted to a simple 0/1 value.
