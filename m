1.0 is out the door, with support (to some degree or another) for Cygwin,
BSD, MacOS X, Solaris, and who knows what else, good job all.

What possibility is there of getting git (& assorted tools) to run natively
on Windows (sacrilege I know) using MinGW?  What truly Unixy-only things
does the code do?  Unfortunately, Windows is a reality for many of us.

I'd like to begin experimenting using git to track all of my data files
acting as a synchronization mechanism.  Have all your files up-to-date
everywhere, revision tracking, & redundancy too...  Dedicated Linux
repository at home, dual boot laptop on the road, Windows machine at work,
etc...

Thoughts?  Suggestions?
