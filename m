Hope this message meet you well, My name is Mr Zhang Dong. I 
write to you because I intend to give you a portion of my deposited funds 
to donate to charity as a result of my present illness and what my family 
members did to me. Do you have any charity foundation in mind we can help?
Write back to so i can give you full details.
Thanks Mr Dong
