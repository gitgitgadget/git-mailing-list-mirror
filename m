That would be great except that most of our customers do not technically allow
us to plug USB drives into any of their computers.  It's a rather silly rule
actually but the drives could be confiscated. 

Thank you for the links to the other thread.  I will read through those today.
I am hoping that this is simpler in practice than it looks on paper, cause what
I see on paper is a fully connected graph of all our employees with all our
customers multiple source locations and with our office server.  It seems like
it could get out of control for tracking where changes might be (who is holding
them)
