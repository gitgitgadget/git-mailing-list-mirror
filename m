I published another tutorial on Git today, this one describing the  
system from a "bottom up" perspective.  I know it's been written about  
this way before, but I was aiming at a bit more thoroughness, and a  
paced introduction to the basics.

There's a link to the PDF is in the following blog post:

Thanks,
   John

p.s. My thanks to the folks on IRC who read it and gave comments,  
especially reuss, com4 and drewr.
