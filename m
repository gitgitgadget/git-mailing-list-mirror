Hmm. So it sounds like qsort_r(), but with the NULL-is-empty magic. But
we already are OK without the latter (and can emulate it easily). Would
it make sense to do:

  #if defined(HAVE_QSORT_S)
  /* huzzah, use the system-native qsort_s */

  #elif defined(HAVE_QSORT_R)
  int git_qsort_s(void *b, size_t n, size_t s,
		   int (*cmp)(const void *, const void *, void *), void *ctx)
  {
	if (!n)
		return 0;
	if (!b || !cmp)
		return -1;
	qsort_r(b, n, s, cmp, ctx);
	return 0;
  }

  #else
  /* fallback implementation as your patch does */
  #endif

To make matters more fun, apparently[1] there are multiple variants of
qsort_r with different argument orders. _And_ apparently Microsoft
defines qsort_s, but it's not quite the same thing. But all of that can
be dealt with by having more specific flags (HAVE_GNU_QSORT_R, etc).

It just seems like we should be able to do a better job of using the
system qsort in many cases.
