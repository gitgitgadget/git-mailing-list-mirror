The usual git maintainer is Junio Hamano <gitster@pobox.com>.

But he is out of touch for a few weeks, so the interim maintainer is
Shawn Pearce <spearce@spearce.org>.

The usual way of mailing patches is a bit different:

 - send one patch per email; if multiple patches are meant to be applied
   in series, number them [PATCH i/n]. In this case, I think you would
   want your patches applied in series (since the second one will
   textually depend on the first).

 - use "git format-patch" to generate the patches. This generates an
   email format that can be applied on the other end by "git am".

 - use "git send-email" to send the patches generated by format-patch.
   You can also send the patches directly from your mail reader, but you
   will want to merge your regular mail headers with those generated by
   format-patch (e.g., the Subject line generated by format-patch should
   become the subject line of your message).

Please follow the usual "subject\n\nbody" convention for commit
messages. And if the patch touches just one subsystem, we usually say
"subsystem: what the patch does." So something like:

  add--interactive: rename [r]evert command to [r]eset

followed by a newline, then your explanation.

I think you may want to note on this patch, too, that "revert" is also
confusing for git users. Maybe like:

  The term "revert" is used very confusingly here. In git, to "revert"
  is to take the changes made by a previous commit and un-apply them,
  creating a new commit. The act of changing what is in the index to
  match HEAD is called "reset".

  Furthermore, incoming svn users will also find this confusing, since
  to them, "revert" means to reset the working tree, which corresponds
  to "checkout" in git.

The first patch has been split out, and then this one contains the
changes for both. So I think what you want to do is to rebase this
change on top of the previous one, so that it should then have just the
"checkout" changes, and then write an appropriate commit message for it.
