The particular mistake that happened to me was that I `git push -f 
origin`'ed the newly created commit (which worked as expected, 
overwriting the original commit) and then leaving my PC in the belief 
that I had successfully pushed my changes.

Yes, that would be incredibly helpful as well, but is not what I am 
after here.

However `git commit --amend` already shows me that I still have "changes 
not staged for commit" when editing the commit message, so that would've 
been enough for my use case.
The problem is that I used `git commit --amend --no-edit`, which did 
neither warn me about missing staged changes nor existing unstaged changes.
If nothing is staged and the user does not intend to edit any metadata, 
git should be able to deduce that the user (me) did forget something.

Yes, exactly.

A good remark.
Maybe in that case it could warn about unstaged edits in the case of 
--no-edit but still succeed.

That might well be, I'm just here to tell my story, it's the designers 
that need to decide at which step I went wrong and which parts could be 
improved.

Kind regards,
