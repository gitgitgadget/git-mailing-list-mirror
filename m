Hi,

I am a student from India. I am very interested in taking part in GSoC
2009, working under git project mentors. However, I am completely new
to git, I have never used it in the past. I have used svn, but only
for downloading source code, never to manage my own code. I am very
interested in open source in general, and I have been using Linux from
5-6 years.

That being said, I have knowledge of C/C++ what was taught to me in
school and college. I realize that my qualifications as such are not
very impressive, and hence I wish to start with a smaller project. I
read on the http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/SoC2009Ideas page that a
"jump-in" project might be the "Restartable Clones" proposal. Seeing
my capabilities, I would like to know whether I am "fit" to undertake
work on that project? I promise to put in a lot of hard work to learn
git, and it's source code. However, I would also require a bit of
hand-holding, at least initially, to get me through.

I am very interested to know the opinion of all prospective mentors on
this issue. Thank you very much, and I do hope I am useful to the git
community.
