I had noticed that they were including experienced technical writers, 
hence my hope that maybe we could learn something from them. It's all to 
easy for devs to say that users never read the documentation without 
appreciating that it may not be readable nor understandable from the 
user perspective, an inverse impostor syndrome effect. Perhaps [1] says 
it all ;-)
