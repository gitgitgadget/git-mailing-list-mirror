Perhaps you're able to share this layout?  Whilst I am not about to go
trawling through the archives, one thing I do know that comes up a
lot, isn't so much how to use git to mimick coming from another SCM,
but more workflows -- that's the big stumbling point for people using
Git.  I know I'd like to see that aspect in a Git book heavily
addressed.
