wouldn't the 'fix'Â  be to the documentation that Amiel quoted to clarify 
that 'annotated tags' can be date sorted but lightweight tags can't.

Maybe Amiel could suggest a short documentation patch to that effect 
that would have helped as a new reader of that doc. In this case it's 
the omission that is easily missed.
