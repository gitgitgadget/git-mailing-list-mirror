So...  any progress on this issue? ;)

I've seen a few failures of 't9825-git-p4-handle-utf16-without-bom'
lately that look like this:

  checking known breakage: 
          git p4 clone --dest="$git" //depot

  error: Tests passed but test cleanup failed; aborting


I think (without digging too deep, I admit) that this is caused by the
same root issue quoted below, with some slight differences:

  - It's not 'git p4 sync', but 'git p4 clone' that starts the
    background 'git fast-import' process in t9825's last test case,
    but on error it leaves the child process behind all the same.

  - The actual error doesn't come from a check in the 'cleanup_git'
    helper function, and not even from within the test case, but from
    the 'rm -fr "$TRASH_DIRECTORY"' in 'test_done', which racily
    removes directories while the background 'git fast-import'
    (re-)creates them.

I suspect the chances for this race occurring increased considerably
with commit 07353d9042 (git p4 test: clean up the p4d cleanup
functions, 2019-03-13): since then there is basically only a single
'kill -9 $pids...' between the last test and 'test_done's cleanup 'rm
-fr', but before that there has always been at least one 'sleep 1' in
'kill_p4d'.
