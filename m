I'm actually surprised we haven't run into it more. We have some custom
test scripts in our fork of Git at GitHub. We usually just use
TEST_SHELL_PATH=bash, but curious, I tried running with dash and "-x",
and three of them failed.

Probably they'd be easy enough to fix (and they're out of tree anyway),
so I'm not really arguing against the escape hatch exactly. Mostly I'm
just surprised that if I introduced 3 cases (out of probably a dozen
scripts), I'm surprised that more contributors aren't accidentally doing
so upstream.
