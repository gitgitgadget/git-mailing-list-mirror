KNode 0.10.2 by default doesn't put original author in Cc:/To:. I'd try
new version (it is high time for an upgrade), perhaps it would behave
better.

I try to use email as it is easier to preserve Cc:/From:. If mail is sent
also to me directly, and I don't forget to check email first, I use it
(like in this example).
