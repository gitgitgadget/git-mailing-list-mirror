From the description, I believe it. Timestamp resolution on NonStop is in microseconds and those are not even slightly simulated. Coupled with this being an MPP not SMP, things can occur within the same microsecond, or in weird situations slightly before or after when comparing the clock on different CPUs. Yes, time-travel is possible at the single microsecond level ðŸ˜‰. Cores are synchronized, but our machine has 4 CPUs and synchronizing the file system across all of them does lead to slightly strange situations.
