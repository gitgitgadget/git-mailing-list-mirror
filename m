Peff, you asked at the Contributors' Summit for a way to get notified when
CI fails for your patch, and I was hesitant to add it (even if it would be
straight-forward, really) because of the false positives.

This is one such example, as the test fails:

	https://dev.azure.com/gitgitgadget/git/_build/results?buildId=944

In particular, the tests t2024 and t5552 are broken for
ma/doc-diff-usage-fix on Windows. The reason seems to be that those are
already broken for the base commit that Junio picked:
jk/diff-rendered-docs (actually, not the tip of it, but the commit fixed
by Martin's patch).

Of course, I understand why Junio picks base commits that are far, far in
the past (and have regressions that current `master` does not have), it
makes sense from the point of view where the fixes should be as close to
the commits they fix.  The downside is that we cannot automate regression
testing more than we do now, with e.g. myself acting as curator of test
failures.

Ciao,
Dscho
