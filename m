I am not that much interested in money, really.  But I do want to get 
something back in return for my efforts.  And no, this does not include 
whining and complaints.

It includes useful bug reports.  It includes a willingness to keep working 
with me until the bugs are fleshed out.  It possibly includes making (and 
maintaining!) an installer.

At the moment, I am happy to say that Git works for me.  Even on Windows.  
I have no problems with the command line, and both Cygwin and MinGW Git do 
their job reliably and joyfully here.

But there might come a time when I get into a position much like Shawn, 
when I have to work with Aunt and Uncle Tillies, who are not as 
clueful and intelligent^W^W^Wused to the command line as I am.

So I want to exploit Open Source, meaning that I give _you_ something, and 
_you_ give me something back.  And that might very well be just a 
suggestion "make the commit button stick out; I did not find it, since 
there are so many buttons".  Or a nice comic "how to use git".  Also a 
beer is appreciated.  Or whatever.

My complaint "let's talk business" was some (frustrated) way to get the 
attention of people who do _not_ give something back, and are astonished 
that just complaining will not get them anywhere.

FWIW I just applied for the project "Git on MSys" on SourceForge.  Let's 
see how this will work out.

Oh, and I will _not_ do such a thing as think about what you might want, 
and then proclaim what would be my price for it.  You _know_ what you 
want, so why don't you just tell me, as a detailed list?

Ciao,
Dscho
