I'm definitely pleased with the direction. A few comments:

We still have this other buffer, which ends up in stat_sep. It should
probably get the same treatment, though I think the module boundaries
make it a little more awkward. We look at it in diff_flush(), which
otherwise doesn't need to know much about the pretty-printing.

Perhaps stat_sep should be a callback?

In the original, this would have been in "after_subject". Which means we
would print it even if print_email_subject is not true. Why do we need
to check it in the new conditional?

Not that I expect the behavior to be wrong either way; why would we have
a mime boundary without setting print_email_subject? But I would think
that "do we have a mime boundary" would be the right conditional to
trigger printing it.
