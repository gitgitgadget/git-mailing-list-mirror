Can this ever trigger in execv_dashed_external()? We should only get
there if get_builtin() returned NULL in the first place. Otherwise, we'd
run and exited via handle_builtin().

So I think this hunk:

...can just go away. And that highlights the issue with externals; we
don't have any internal database that says "these ones handle their own
pager". We don't even have a list of all the possibilities, since users
can drop whatever they like into their $PATH.

So we'd have to make a (backwards-incompatible) decision that pager.*
doesn't work for external commands, and they must manually trigger the
pager themselves. I'm undecided on whether that's reasonable or not
(certainly it's what git-stash would want, but it may be hurting other
commands).

Anyway, I think that's out of scope for your series, which is just
trying to make the builtins work better.
