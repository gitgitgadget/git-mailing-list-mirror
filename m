My main goal is to help developers figure out what is wrong with a file, 
and then we can use other diagnostic tools to discover how it got into 
that state.

Martin's initial test cases are wonderful. I've adapted them to test the 
other conditions in the verify_commit_graph() method and caught some 
interesting behavior in the process. I'm preparing v2 so we can 
investigate the direction of the tests.

Thanks,
