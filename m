Hi,

Lund.pm and Data-foreningen are trying to organize a 'git' workshop.

The workshop will consist of a presentation in the morning followed by =
a lunch=20
in a local restaurant and a workshop after lunch.

We already have a location where the workshop will take place. =A0Most =
probably=20
a Saturday to allow as many people as possible to join us. The location=
 is in=20
Malm=F6 the biggest town in the south of Sweden and only 30mn by train =
from=20
Copenhagen capital of Danmark. We, of course, welcome people from other=
 places=20
too.

We are already working on securing one or two speakers that will enligh=
ten us.=20

I would like the git community to help us with:

- has a git workshop already been organized?
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0is there material that we could get?
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0any conference organization existing (something=
 like YAPC)?

- what's the interrest? I'm sure I can get 30 ppl to join but if there =
is=20
interrest we can organize something bigger.

- Can you be :
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0- a speaker
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0- a sponsor

- If you come, what would you like to learn, discuss?

Cheers, Nadim.

PS: there's a lot of interrest for git in the Perl community right now =
and=20
rumors has it that Perl itself is going over to git. Next year YAPC in=20
Portugal would be a great opportunity to present git in depth to perl=20
developers. If someone is interrested, please let me know.
