all credentials are url encoded so the only spaces that are affected are
the ones that were added by careless editing of that file.

I wanted to keep that as an undocumented "feature" as it is just meant
to help people to avoid a fatal error during the transition but didn't

encourage people to start editing their files to add tabs and spaces.

that is for the protocol part of it (which is used between git and the
credential helper), the file format for this specific helper doesn't
require that.
