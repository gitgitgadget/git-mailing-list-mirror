Good evening all,

As some people may be aware, some time ago now I created some RSS feeds 
by filtering the Git mailing lists (http://gitrss.q42.co.uk/) to make 
the task of following only certain types of information from this list 
easier.

I have now extended this tool to include a git-announce mailing list.  
This is an announce-only style list that receives all the same mails 
that are pulled into the announce RSS feed.

The website for the list can be found here:

   http://lists.q42.co.uk/listinfo/git-announce

It's a mailman hosted list, so the normal email based interaction works 
too.  So you can also subscribe by mailing:

   git-announce-subscribe@q42.co.uk

I primarily created this for my own use - but since it is something 
that has been asked about in the past, I though I would share it.

Comments/suggestions welcome (though I don't promise to change anything 
;).

Please also let me know if you have any objections to the existence of 
this list (I do promise to respond to these).

Julian
