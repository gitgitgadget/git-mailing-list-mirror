And your background before that (those 5 years?). Can you say that
you're an average, to fit a imagned genralized 20's audience? I'm sure
you have heard how hard it is nowadays to teach programming or Software
Engineering in Universities.

"Details". You said it. They are consulted.

Not to learn as a primary method per se. The manual pages are too
technical; not really their fault, they are supposed to be. As "manuals"
are.

The progression goes:

    - Google, more Google, and yet more Google (or the next line swapped)
    - Videos, and Google blogs
    - Co-worker, Co-student, Co-<whatever>
    - Git Book, The Pro Book etc. (when there is time, free of other duties).
    - And more Google.
    ... man pages at the bottom after you have used Git for some time.

To add perspective: there is no manual pages in Windows. What you have
is a browser that is one click away from information.
