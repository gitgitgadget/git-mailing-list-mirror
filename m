Yes to your first question.

Regarding the final sentence, yes, I agree it's explainable. But I
thought that handling negation like this was one of the main complaints
of earlier iterations?

OK. Let's just disable the short-circuit for --column then (i.e., what
Taylor posted earlier). That's explainable, and I doubt the performance
implications are going to be all that noticeable.
