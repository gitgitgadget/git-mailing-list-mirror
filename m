As was mentioned, the Cygwin project is very far from dead and has
actually never been close to dead.  It is, however, like any open source
project and things like the setup program are always under slow,
sporadic development.

The core cygwin dll is under active development and maintenance and most
of the packages in the distribution are under active maintenance, however.
