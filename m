IIRC, we do the word-diff by first finding the individual hunks with a
normal line diff, and then doing a word diff inside those hunks. So one
easy option would be to add a --color-words option that gets passed
along to the underlying display diff and just disables hunk splitting. I
think we'd also need to start parsing the DISPLAY hunks more carefully
to make sure we re-sync at hunk boundaries.
