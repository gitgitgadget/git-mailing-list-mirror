I agree.

Having just fixed a segfault in the GIT_TRACE code caused by a
non-terminated argv generated by the alias code, I think I would prefer
that we just consistently do the NULL-termination. You are otherwise
creating a maintenance pitfall when somebody later passes the value to
unsuspecting code.
