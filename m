Hi Jakub,

Where have you been all these years? :D

git-pathspec(7) is a great idea. It bugs me that all the pathspec
details are hidden in that glossary file (though I didn't know it was
also available via "git help glossary", which probably just reinforces
its invisibility). The closet place I could think of was git(1) but
that page is already very long.

You mean the list of commands in this man page? OK. Another thing we
could do is the reverse direction, add gitpathspec(7) as a reference
to all commands that may need it.

I have that problem sometimes and I don't think I can call myself a
noob anymore. I usually need to do some grepping. So yeah "git
apropos" would be great.
