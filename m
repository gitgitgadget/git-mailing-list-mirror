Hey, I think you're doing a great job. A small improvement may be to
copy these to the wiki for longer term, but we're all lazy about
maintaining them.

Perhaps at least have a TODO page? How about what I just placed in
http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/ToDo ? A link to the 'todo' head, and to a
search for 'Unresolved Issues' in the list archives...

Should give newcomers a hint of where things are, and how to gauge
directions and interests...
