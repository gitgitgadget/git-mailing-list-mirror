Yeah, `cache_size` should absolutely be a `size_t`. If you have more
than a billion objects, obviously your cache is going to be bigger than
that. But most importantly, somebody can _claim_ to have a huge number
of objects and foil the size checks by wrapping around.

Nah, we should be doing this as a size_t in the first place. There are
similar problems with the .idx format, btw. I have a series to deal with
that which I've been meaning to post.

Yeah, I agree this ought to be checking the minimum size against the
header _plus_ the trailer.

I think the previous patch is actually where it goes wrong. The original
was checking for a minimum of:

  if (index->map_size < sizeof(*header) + the_hash_algo->rawsz)

which is the header plus the trailer. We want to readjust for the
MAX_RAWSZ part of the header, so it should be:

  size_t header_size = sizeof(*header) - GIT_MAX_RAWSZ + the_hash_algo->rawsz;
  if (index->map_size < sizeof(*header) + the_hash_algo->rawsz)

Yes, I agree this should be done as a subtraction as you showed to avoid
integer overflow.

Right. I think that's right, and the previous patch is just buggy.
