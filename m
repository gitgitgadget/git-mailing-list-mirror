Yeah, I saw those. I don't think they're worth hunting down at this
point. It's quite probable that the same leaks are exercised elsewhere,
and we'll catch them later.

Once the whole test suite runs without reporting any leaks via abort(),
I'll feel more compelled to start grepping stderr for other cases. :)

I think I got funny truncated stack traces with just LSAN that went away
with ASAN, but I didn't dig. If you try that, remember that:

  - Technically just SANITIZE=address turns on the leak detector, but
    you need "leak" in the string to turn on the UNLEAK() magic. So use
    "SANITIZE=address,leak".

  - You'll have to set ASAN_OPTIONS=abort_on_error=1 in the environment
    manually to enable leak detection.

Once the test suite passes with leak detection on, I think we'd probably
do both of those automatically (but until then they make ASAN by itself
unusable).

Agreed. These leaks are really just a special form of bug. Those pipes
could be hiding other bugs, too. But again, I'm not too concerned. The
places that pipe git are doing so because they are not meant to be
testing that particular command (and it should generally be covered
elsewhere).
