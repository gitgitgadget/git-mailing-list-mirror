Yeah, as somebody who has added or touched a lot of those paths, I've
often wondered this myself: what would break if you asked for blobs but
not trees? I think it does not work like you'd expect, because
list-objects.c:process_tree() will not recurse the trees at all (and
hence you'd never see any blob).

I don't think the code Patrick added is that much more complex. Most if
it was cleaning up rough edges in the filtering system, and making sure
that bitmaps supported this style of filtering. I _think_ the existing
bitmap code would Just Work with the example you showed above. It uses
list-objects.c to do any fill-in traversal, and then
traverse_bitmap_commit_list() uses the type-bitmaps to filter the
results.

But it would be likewise broken for the case of "no trees, just
blobs", because of the problem in list-objects.c that I mentioned (but
worse, it would only be _half_ broken; we might even produce the right
answer if we don't have to do any fill-in traversal!).

Anyway. I do think this all could be done using the existing bits in
rev_info. But there is value in making it all part of the modular
filtering system.
