RE: IMMEDIATE PAYMENT REMITTANCE

This is to notify you that your over due entitlement fund has been gazetted to be released in which an indoor meetings were held between my governments, International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank Auditors, representatives of the European Union, Asian and American Congress respectively concerning the inheritance.

It generated an interest of US$ 15.5 Million united state dollars, which we are about to pay to you via Special Bank Instrument directly to your account on the instruction from the Government.

Be informed that your name was stipulated under the category "A" awaiting the receipt of his payment therefore; you are advised as a matter of urgency, to reconfirm the following details:

YOUR FULL NAMES
CORRESPONDING ADDRESS
TELEPHONE / FAX NUMBERS
MOBILE PHONE and
AGE

Note that if you have received this message by (electronic email sending error) to your system; kindly help us by informing us to enable us sort this out as my office has been instructed by the Government to take the issues of the release of all payment owed to foreign beneficiaries very serious.

It will interest you to know that as soon as we receive the above details, we will commence with all needed necessary procedures and issue all payments details to you, in other to approve the release of your long over due entitlement fund, I want you to understand that this arrangement supersedes all the previous arrangements given to you. 

Nevertheless, if we do not hear from you within the next seven (7) working days from today, it shall attract indefinite postponement of your payment and my government will not be blamed for such action, any question should be directed to this office. 

The Government is sorry for any inconvenience the delay in releasing your entitlement fund must have caused you as a result of unprofessional services rendered by the banking and financial institutes and that is our aim of objective.

Congratulations!!!!!!

Truly yours,

MR PETER SAND.
