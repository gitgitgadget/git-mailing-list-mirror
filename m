The files in the root directory are (mostly) library code that ends up 
in libgit.a. The builtin directory contains the individual git commands 
that form the git binary that is linked with libgit.a. builtin/diff.c 
contains cmd_diff() which will be called when the user runs `git diff`. 
That function parses the command line options and sets up the necessary 
data to pass to the diff implementation in /diff.c. The diff and log 
family of commands are a bit different to most of the other commands in 
that the option parsing is mostly done by calling setup_revisions() in 
/revision.c rather than using the option parsing library routines in 
/parse-options.c directly. I think the `--dirty` option for diff ends up 
being handled by handle_ignore_submodules_arg() in submodule.c, I'll 
leave it to you to see where that is called from (you can use `git grep`).

I'm going to be off line for the rest of today, hopefully someone else 
will be able to help if you get stuck or I'll try and answer any other 
questions tomorrow.

Best Wishes

Phillip
