Neither. As far as I can tell, we still run the "check-chainlint" target
as part of "make test", and that's what I saw fail. For instance:

  https://github.com/peff/git/actions/runs/9856301557/job/27213352807

Every one of the "win test" jobs failed, with the same outcome: running
check-chainlint triggered the "internal scanning error".

I think that commit would prevent it from running as part of the actual
test scripts. But we'd still do check-chainlint to run the chainlint
self-tests. And because it only sets "--no-chain-lint" in GIT_TEST_OPTS
and not GIT_TEST_CHAIN_LINT=0, I think that the bulk run of chainlint.pl
by t/Makefile is still run (and then ironically, when that is run the
Makefile manually suppresses the per-script runs, so that
--no-chain-lint option is truly doing nothing).

And I think is true even with the ci/run-test-slice.sh approach that the
Windows tests use. They still drive it through "make", and just override
the $(T) variable.

Ah, good thinking. I'm not sure if that's it, though. Just PERLIO=crlf
should behave the same way (the ":" is technically a separator, and it
is only a style suggestion that you prepend one). Likewise a space is
supposed to be OK, too, so PERLIO="unix crlf" should work. But neither
seems to work for me. So I'm still puzzled.

OK, I'll add that to my series, then. The fact that we weren't really
_intending_ to run chainlint there makes me tempted to just punt and
disable it. But AFAICT we have been running it for a while, and it could
benefit people on Windows (though it is a bit funky that we do a full
check-chainlint in each slice). And I suspect disabling it reliably
might be a trickier change than what I wrote above anyway. ;)
