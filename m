Yeah, that would be nice (though at least if it's all contained in
remote.c, we can live with some duplication). There's already some
duplication in the way remote_ref_for_branch() applies remote refspecs.

And I think all of this may be duplicated with git-push itself (which
would also be nice to get rid of, but last time I looked into it was
hard to refactor it to do so).

Right, there we already have the remote name, and are applying the fetch
refspecs to know what our tracking branch would be. So in
remote_ref_for_branch(), we'd just not apply those.

We also have PUSH_DEFAULT_NOTHING, for which obviously we'd return
nothing (NULL or an empty string).

Likewise for SIMPLE, we probably need to check that the upstream has a
matching name (and return nothing if not).

Yes, that makes sense.

Those will both return tracking refs. I think you just want
merge[0]->src for the upstream case.

And yes, the two can be different. It's the same case as when the
upstream branch has a different name than the current branch.

This would basically be reverse-applying the fetch refspec. In theory
it should be possible, but there are cases where somebody has
overlapping refspecs. But at any rate, I think it's better to just get
the pre-mapped values (i.e., avoid calling tracking_for_push_dest() in
the first place).

Yeah, I think that's going to be the easiest. It would be nice to avoid
repeating that switch(), but frankly I think the boilerplate you'll end
up with trying to handle the two cases may be worse than just repeating
it. It may be worth adding a comment to each function to mention the
other, and that any changes need to match.
