For GitHub, we ship a VM appliance, so we just put what we want into
/etc/gitconfig. I think in the worst case you could simplify everything
down to "put [include]path=/usr/share/gitlab/gitconfig into your system
config.  Though I'm a little surprised that you wouldn't just ship your
own version of Git that is used on the backend (so you know you have the
right version, plus any custom patches you'd want), and then point its
system config to /usr/share/gitlab/ or whatever.

But I'm probably just showing my ignorance of your setup / install
procedures, and there are a dozen reasons why that wouldn't work. ;)

We do have a couple scripts (like our git-repack wrapper) that make
heavy use of "git -c" to tweak things that don't have a command-line
option, or for which using it is awkward. It does clutter up "ps" a bit,
but it's sometimes nice to see the extra values, too (just as you'd see
command-line options).
