The patch generated by git-format-patch has author information (in 
"From:" header), original commit date (in "Date:" header), commit 
message (first line in "Subject:", rest in message body), place for 
comments which are not to be included in commit message, diffstat for 
easier patch review, and git extended diff (with information about 
renames detection, mode changes, 7-characters wide shortcuts of file 
contents identifiers). It does not record parent information, original 
comitter and comitter date, which branch we are on etc. You can quite 
easily provide ordering of patches.

Sending patches via email prohibits first line of commit message to be 
enclosed in brackets (subject usually is "[PATCH] Commit description" 
or "[PATCH n/m] Commit description") and enforces git convention of 
commit message to consist of first line describing commit shortly, 
separated by empty line from the longer description and signoff lines.

"Bundle" equivalent, although binary in nature, would be thin pack.

How very true...

If I remember correctly git binary diff format is xdiff based, and uses 
kind of ascii85 encoding (PostScript).
