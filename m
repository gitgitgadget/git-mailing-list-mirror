it tunes out that, at least for my problem is to populating filespec
data in parepare_temp_file() and not freeing it after creating temp
file with prep_temp_blob().

parepare_temp_file() and diff_populate_filespec() has a lot in
similarity. so it'd be nice to refactor some. and re-introduce
diff_free_filespec_data() and call right after prep_temp_blob() in
prepare_temp_file().

Junio, did you also mean to clean-up these functions when you said in
the thread of "Re: gitweb - option to disable rename detection"?
