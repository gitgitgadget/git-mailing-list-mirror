Why not?  There was never the need for an upgrade.
All connected hardware is well supported.  Sure,
there are no binary packages for it and you have to
compile from sources but most apps can be made to
run on it (on the way you learn to hate autoconf).
And I wish the 2.6 system were as reliable as the
2.0 one ...

Ciao, ET.
