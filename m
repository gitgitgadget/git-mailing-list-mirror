While at it, we thought that we'd have a little git-together on Sunday, a 
few hours before we're (or at least I'm) sober again from Saturday night.  
So everybody who is in the area of San Jose: Sunday is Talk Like A Git 
Day.

Sadly, Junio is not able to attend, but I will hoist a drink or three to 
him.

Ciao,
Dscho
