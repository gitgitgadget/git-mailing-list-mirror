Hi Michael,
I'll go ahead and start a pointless thread along with the reasons
provided via answers to the 2008 Git Survey[1]:

43) What could be improved on the Git homepage(s)?

* Use git-scm.com instead of git.or.cz as the default homepage
* Learn from git-scm.com. Make it more newbie-friendly. More focus on
documentation
* Better graphical design/organization - new(?) git-scm.com looks better
* Look at git-scm.com :)
* Cleaner design, better organization (http://git-scm.com/ is a good start).
* Design - git-scm.com is superior compared to git.or.cz. Also the
first one is more user-friendly having exposed more important things
for users rather for experienced veterans who want to download most
current git release.
* I like what Scott Chacon has done with http://git-scm.com
* I prefer Scot Chacons rewrite, but mostly just it's look and feel.
The original site is perfectly functional; though it could do with
better documentation.
* git-scm.com
* git-scm.com is a great example of some light improvement. I do think
that the online man-page navigation is a little annoying, having to
revert to find in the browser to get to the right spot on the page. An
alternate alphabetical listing might help.
* Don't put everything on the first page, it is a little confusing.
Create categories, like download, documentation, About git and at
least a dedicated page for each of these categories. I think the
"design" could also be improved. I saw a proposition not long ago
aboutr a new git homepage on the mailing list: www.git-scm.com. I
think this site is easier to navigate and thus makes it easier to find
informations.
* I like the new git-scm site (with the blob committed to storing trees)
* Merge with Git-scm page?
* I like <http://www.git-scm.com> very much. I'd vote for it to be the
official Git homepage.
* git.or.cz?? I prefer http://git-scm.com/, it's better for beginners,
and the information is nicely presented (doc, tips, videos..).
* promote git-scm.com instead of git.or.cz
* See http://git-scm.com/
* I think git-scm.com is starting to get things right. Making
documentation readily available especially.
* Complete re-design by somebody actually the least bit proficient in
design? Oh wait, that's already been done at http://git-scm.com/.
* Rather ugly design. git-scm.com looks much better.
* I like Scott Chacon's site a lot and use it often: http://git-scm.com/
* Compare #1 and #2 1) http://git-scm.com 2) http://git.or.cz
* http://git.or.cz and http://git-scm.com should be merged
* http://git-scm.com/ is a worderfull project, making the homepage
look and feel much better and "user friendly". The source code is at
http://github.com/schacon/gitscm. What about using this as the Git
official homepage (not the domain, but the interface and images).
* git-scm.com should be the official page :)
* Organization and flow particularly for new users. I think Scott
Chacon's git-scm.com site does a much better job. Organization and
navigation of the content are the things that make it a winner.
* The www.git-scm.com homepage is great.
* Which one? http://git.or.cz/ or http://git-scm.com/ I tend to use
git-scm.com just because it looks nicer, is written in Rails and has
more user friendly information. Rather than browsing what feels like
"A manual online" that is git.or.cz
* I think the homepage (http://git-scm.com/) however work should be
done to have that come ahead of http://git.or.cz/ which currently tops
all the queries. I would try to strike a deal with that domain to
http-redirect to the new url. I can only imagine that this duplication
leads to confusion and a bad experience.
* It should look more like http://git-scm.com
* http://git-scm.com/ > git.or.cz -scm has all the info I might want
up front in one page, while my eyes gloss over just looking at or.cz.
