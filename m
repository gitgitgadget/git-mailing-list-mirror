write_file() will call strbuf_complete_line(), so even passing "" will
result in a file with a newline in it (I didn't dig, but this comes from
e7ffa38c in 2015, so it may well have been a response to the breakage
you were thinking of).

So actually all of the "%s\n" here can be just "%s".

But there _is_ a reason not to use "", which is that it triggers
-Wformat-zero-length (which is part of -Wall unless you explicitly turn
it off, which our DEVELOPER=1 setup does). For a long time you _had_ to
do that, but these days we're actually clean with respect to that
warning.

So using "\n" here is better, and likewise here:

> > +		write_file(rebase_path_verbose(), "");

Unless we really do want a zero-length file, in which case:

  write_file_buf(path, "", 0);

is the right option. That matches the shell version, but I'd be
surprised if it mattered, since it's clearly meant to be "if this file
exists, we're verbose".
