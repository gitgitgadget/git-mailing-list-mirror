True, my use of BOOL was obviously dumb, as it wouldn't have arguments.
But in theory anything that takes an argument could have an OPTARG
variant. So that would include special stuff like OPT_EXPIRY_DATE,
OPT_FILENAME, and so on. Though I would not be surprised if we currently
only use it for string/integer.

The macro itself wouldn't notice, but I guess the generated code would
probably complain about getting "(foo,bar)" as the initializer, if you
really sent to many.

But I was more worried about an error where you accidentally give an
extra argument. Right now that's an error, but would it be quietly
shifted into the OPTARG slot?

For a dedicated OPT_STRING_OPTARG(), I'd agree. For OPT_STRING() that
uses varargs, I'm more on the fence (because of the cross-checking
above; now we are getting into "accidentally adding a parameter is
quietly accepted" territory).

I dunno. Maybe saving some keystrokes is worth it, but having to say
both OPTARG _and_ provide the extra argument makes things less subtle.

Ah, yeah, I've seen something like this before. I do think it would
work as you're suggesting. I'm just not sure if being verbose and
explicit is better than trying to be clever here.
