Thanks, this version looks good to me.

Oddly, it does not seem to apply. I get:

  $ git am -3 ~/patch
  Applying: Allow stashes to be referenced by index only
  Using index info to reconstruct a base tree...
  M       git-stash.sh
  error: patch failed: t/t3903-stash.sh:604
  error: t/t3903-stash.sh: patch does not apply
  error: Did you hand edit your patch?
  It does not apply to blobs recorded in its index.
  Patch failed at 0001 Allow stashes to be referenced by index only

The culprit seems to be the final hunk header:

> @@ -604,7 +624,21 @@ test_expect_success 'invalid ref of the form stash@{n}, n >= N' '

This should be "604,6", as there are 6 context lines, and your patch
does not remove any lines.

I suspect the maintainer can fix it up while applying, but for my
curiosity: did you hand-edit it, or is there a potential bug in git's
diff code?
