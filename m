Makes sense, but the previous authors obviously weren't diligent
enough to include such a test, which presumably made the fixed bug
remain undetected for so long, so I wanted to put some emphasis on
the addition of a test.

I have no problems with dropping that part, but IMHO that's nitpicking.
Also, dropping it would delete some of the context that people might
find useful later.

With all the respect, I think that having that paragraph is actually
good, because explaining it clearly provides good context for the
repository history and people reading it later.

Setting such flags should actually be performed in a callback,
but in this case creating a callback isn't warranted, IMHO.  Thus,
that comment tries to explain why a flag is set out of place.
I have no objections against removing this comment, if you find
it doing more harm than good.

I didn't place it immediately above the relevant line because it
also applies to the adjacent block for the --resend option, and I
wanted to reduce the code churn that would result from placing it
immediately before the relevant line, and moving it a couple of
lines above just a couple of patches later.

Well, I need to split the series anyway, so the v2 is pretty much
inevitable.
