Hi,


so I noticed that the diff output generated by git tools, such as 
"git diff", "git log -p", etc. is not accepted by TortoiseSVN, but is 
accepted by patch(1). Now I wondered which program could be at fault.
Git produces:

	--- a/src/foo.c
	+++ b/src/foo.c
	@@ your hunk goes here... @@
	etc.

Random webpages[1,2] have a tendency wanting to tell me unidiff is

	--- a/src/foo.c	$TIMESTAMP
	+++ b/src/foo.c	$TIMESTAMP
	@@ hunks... @@

instead, i.e. with the timestamp.
Since the diff format is known to be sketchy (are there _any_ uptodate 
specs that are actually followed?), which tool(s) is/are to blame?

 * git for not producing unidiff(-with-a-timestamp)
 * TSVN for not accepting unidiff(-without-a-timestamp)
(* patch for accepting unidiff body together with a non-unidiff file 
   header)


Any insights?

Jan
