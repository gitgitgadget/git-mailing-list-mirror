Interesting. I re-ran mine just to double check, and got:

Test                        HEAD^                 HEAD

(for some reason my whole machine is faster today; maybe I had closed
slack).

This is on a fresh-ish clone of linux.git.

I wasn't sure if we'd ever see entry_or_key as NULL, in which case the
second container_of() would be undefined behavior. There's a
container_of_or_null() for this, but it seemed simpler to just avoid the
deref entirely if we didn't need it.

I think in practice we won't ever pass NULL, though. Even a
hashmap_get() needs to pass in a hashmap_entry with the hash value in
it. Though I think that's technically _also_ undefined behavior. If I
have a struct where the entry is not at the beginning, like:

  struct foo {
    const char *bar;
    struct hashmap_entry ent;
  };

then:

  e2 = container_of(ptr_to_entry, struct foo, ent);

is going to form a pointer at 8 bytes before ptr_to_entry. If it really
is a "struct hashmap_entry" on the stack, then it's pointing at garbage.

We don't dereference it, so it's likely fine in practice, but even
computing such a pointer does violate the standard.

Yes. This is how most hashmap users do it. It's only a few lines, and
sharing without extra work would mean passing the hash value around
(otherwise we'd have to recompute it again), which is awkward.

Though in our case oidhash() is cheap enough that perhaps it's not worth
worrying about?

Right, that calls oidhash() again. If we're OK with that, I agree it's a
bit shorter and not any more awkward. I do worry slightly that it sets a
bad example, though (you wouldn't want to repeat a strhash(), for
example).
