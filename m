This addition is obviously correct.

I want to note one thing that confused me while reviewing. While looking
to see if there were other returns, I noticed that the lines right near
the end of your context are funny:

        if (active_cache_changed &&
              write_locked_index(&the_index, &index_lock, COMMIT_LOCK))
                  /*
                   * TRANSLATORS: %s will be "revert", "cherry-pick" or
                   * "rebase -i".
                   */
                  return error(_("%s: Unable to write new index file"),
                          _(action_name(opts)));
          rollback_lock_file(&index_lock);

At first I thought that rollback was a noop, since write_locked_index()
would always either commit or rollback. But it's needed for the case
when we active_cache_changed isn't true.

So I think it's correct as-is, but I wonder if writing it as:

  if (!active_cache_changed)
	rollback_lock_file(&index_lock);
  else if (write_locked_index(&the_index, &index_lock, COMMIT_LOCK))
	return error(...);

might be easier to follow. I'm OK with leaving it, too, but thought I'd
mention it in case it confused other reviewers.
