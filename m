You've pointed me to the git list, but since I actually made my
observations with Msysgit I kept that list copied.

I didn't know that.  Since I couldn't find an entry in the list of
changes for Git 1.5.4 RC3 and both Git and Msysgit are labelled as RCs I
though instant feedback was the right thing.  Sorry for inconveniencing you.

Thanks!  Actually, I think reporting bugs already is giving something
(feedback) to the community.  Since an application has the chance to be
distributed with one less bug, user's acceptance is probably a little
bit higher.

Giving something to you - feel free to use one of the LaTeX or MetaPost
packages I've written, read the MetaPost manual where I'm a co-author or
ask LaTeX or MetaPost related questions on some LaTeX related newsgroup
or list.  I'd be happy to give some assistance.

As for Git, since I don't speak Perl and I'm not fluent in C I guess I
can't help much on that front.

Best regards,
Stephan Hennig
