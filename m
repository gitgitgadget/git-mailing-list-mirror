I meant only that most callers that parse oids, both in-file and not,
would want to stop knowing about the length ahead of time. I think
parse_oid_hex() solves that problem for most callers.

I don't know. TBH, I'm not sure anyone has much interest in making
http-push work with new hashes. I'd be OK if it simply doesn't until
somebody interested shows up to change that.

You have to know how big the data you have is, but you don't necessarily
know whether that makes a complete hash or not. With a "remove slashes
and then parse" strategy, you can do the removing without worrying about
how big things are _supposed_ to be, and then the parser can tell you if
you have a valid oid or not. The logic for what a hash looks like _and_
how big it must be are both in the parser.

With the new code you have here, we have to be a bit more intimate with
SHA1_HEXSZ in the calling code. It knows that the hash consists of a
certain number of hex bytes.

I'm perfectly willing to punt on it for now. I'm not sure we know 100%
yet what "new"-style hashes will look like, nor how their loose-object
filenames would look.
