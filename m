Revised the commit message to include the following at the end:

When writing the new layer in split commit-graph, we write a GDAT chunk
only if the topmost layer has a GDAT chunk. This guarantees that if a
layer has GDAT chunk, all lower layers must have a GDAT chunk as well.

Rewriting layers follows similar approach: if the topmost layer below
set of layers being rewritten (in the split commit-graph chain) exists,
and it does not contain GDAT chunk, then the result of rewrite does not
have GDAT chunks either.

Thanks! There were helpful.

While we work as expected in the first scenario i.e merging 4 and 5, we
would *still* write a layer without GDAT in the second scenario.

I have tweaked split_graph_merge_strategy() to fix this:

----------------------------------------------

diff --git a/commit-graph.c b/commit-graph.c
index 6d54d9a286..246fad030d 100644
--- a/commit-graph.c
+++ b/commit-graph.c
@@ -1973,6 +1973,9 @@ static void split_graph_merge_strategy(struct write_commit_graph_context *ctx)
 		}
 	}
 
+	if (!ctx->write_generation_data && g->chunk_generation_data)
+		ctx->write_generation_data = 1;
+
 	if (flags != COMMIT_GRAPH_SPLIT_REPLACE)
 		ctx->new_base_graph = g;
 	else if (ctx->num_commit_graphs_after != 1)

----------------------------------------------------

That is, if we were not writing generation data (because of mixed
generation concerns) but the new topmost layer has a generation data
chunk, we have merged all layers without GDAT chunk and can now write a
GDAT chunk safely.

Yes, using unsigned int instead of uint32_t (although in most of cases
it would be same).  If commit_graph had other flags as well, we could
have used a bit field.

It interferes with rewriting the split commit-graph, as you might have
guessed from the above code snippet.
