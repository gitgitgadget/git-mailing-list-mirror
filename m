I think --exclude-per-directory is fine, since it uses OPT_STRING().
Using "--no-exclude-per-directory" just means we'll cancel any
previously found option.

In an ideal world we'd perhaps do something useful with the negated
forms for the others, but I don't think the underlying code is set up to
do that (i.e., how do you undo "setup_standard_excludes()"). Possibly we
could switch to setting a flag (which could then be cleared), and
resolve the flags after parsing the whole command line. But often
options with callbacks list this have subtle user-visible timing effects
(e.g., that the command line options need to take effect in the order
they were found).

So unless somebody actually wants these negated forms to do something
useful, it's probably not worth the trouble and risk of regression.  But
we obviously should at least disallow them explicitly rather than
segfaulting.

I thought adding PARSE_OPT_NONEG like this would work:

diff --git a/builtin/ls-files.c b/builtin/ls-files.c

 		OPT_SET_INT_F(0, "full-name", &prefix_len,
 			      N_("make the output relative to the project top directory"),
 			      0, PARSE_OPT_NONEG),

But it actually does something quite interesting. Because of the NONEG
flag, we know that the user cannot mean "--no-exclude" itself. So our
liberal prefix-matching kicks in, and we treat it as
--no-exclude-per-directory. I.e., it becomes a silent noop and the user
gets no warning.

I think parse_options() may be overly liberal here, and we might want to
change that. But in the interim, it probably makes sense to just detect
the "unset" case in the callbacks, report an error, and return -1.
