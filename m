I like this approach much better than what I showed earlier. But...

I don't think the subtle point this comment is making goes away. We're
still growing the list in the loop that calls tip_oids_contain() (and
which now calls just oidset_contains). That's OK for the reasons given
here, but I think that would need to be moved down to this code:

I.e., we need to say here why it's OK to summarize newlist in the
oidset, even though we're adding to it later.
