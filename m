Hello Max,

git-scm.com is the best source and it's not outdated. It gets an
update after every single release of Git.
See e.g. http://git-scm.com/docs/git-config which was updated in the
current stable version.
It seems that git-remote-helper's documentation was just not updated
since version 1.7.12.3.

Best regards,
    Sebastian
