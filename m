"git commit -a" ignores untracked files and follows all tracked
files, regardless of whether they are listed in .gitignore.  So
don't use it to motivate gitignore.

	I noticed this while reading through the git-scm book, which
	looks very good.  If I am missing something, I would be very

	exact contents of the working tree would prefer
	"git commit -a -i ." over "git commit -a"?

 You can tell git to ignore certain files by creating a file called .gitignore
 in the top level of your working directory, with contents such as:
