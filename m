Hi,

Clearly, a lot of my patches have not been reviewed properly, so even
though they are technically correct, and would benefit users, some have
specifically been requested by them, and at least one would
significantly improve Git's user interface... they are going nowhere.

Here is the summary, and you can also find a web version:
https://github.com/felipec/git/wiki/My-patches

Cheers.

=== branch: improve verbose option ===

People have commented that this is a good change, yet it's ignored.

----
Felipe Contreras (2):
      branch: trivial cleanup
      branch: reorganize verbose options
----

Patches: http://mid.gmane.org/1381561229-19947-1-git-send-email-felipe.contreras@gmail.com +

=== Reject non-ff pulls by default (v4) ===

The conclusion of the discussions is that this change is good, yet it doesn't move forward.

----
Felipe Contreras (7):
      pull: rename pull.rename to pull.mode
      pull: refactor $rebase variable into $mode
      pull: add --merge option
      pull: add merge-ff-only option
      pull: add warning on non-ff merges
      pull: cleanup documentation
      pull: add documentation about non-ff merges

=== remote-helpers: test reorganization (v2) ===

People have requested both that the scripts are autogenerated, and that we
provide instructions how to install these for distributions, this fixes both,
and yet is not merged.

----
Felipe Contreras (5):
      remote-helpers: generate scripts
      build: fix installation of scripts
      remote-helpers: rename tests
      remote-helpers: allow direct test execution

Patches: http://mid.gmane.org/1381561465-20147-1-git-send-email-felipe.contreras@gmail.com +

=== build: add default aliases (v3) ===

All version control systems out there have default aliases, except Git.
Mercurial even allows overriding the main commands, like 'hg commit' so all the
arguments that use the override of default aliases causing discrepancies as a
reason to reject this change are void, since clearly Mercurial doesn't have
such problems.

      build: add default aliases

Patches: http://mid.gmane.org/1381561485-20252-1-git-send-email-felipe.contreras@gmail.com +

=== Officially start moving to the term 'staging area' ===

Everybody agrees this is the way to go, and yet Junio doesn't comment on the way
forward.

----
Felipe Contreras (14):
      Add proper 'stage' command

=== transport-helper: updates (v3) ===

People have requested --foce --dry-run and old:new support for remote helpers,
this introduces those options and it was rejected without any reason given.

----
Felipe Contreras (10):
      transport-helper: add 'force' to 'export' helpers
      transport-helper: fix extra lines
      transport-helper: check for 'forced update' message
      fast-export: improve argument parsing

=== Introduce publish tracking branch ===

This improves the support for triangular workflows, which even Junio accepted
is lacking, yet it didn't even receive comments.

----
Felipe Contreras (8):
      branch: trivial cleanup
      branch: reorganize verbose options
      push: trivial reorganization

=== New git-related helper (v10) ===

This series was included in 'pu' and then silently dropped with no reason
given. 'git contacts' implements a rudimentary version of this, but lacks all
the features. I started an external project as a result.

      Add new git-related helper to contrib
      contrib: related: add tests
      contrib: related: add support for multiple patches

=== fetch: add new fetch.default configuration ===

No response whatsoever, even after a thorough expalanation of the issue.
'git fetch .' is still braindead.

      fetch: add new fetch.default configuration

Patches: http://mid.gmane.org/1381561625-20624-1-git-send-email-felipe.contreras@gmail.com +

=== Version fixes and cleanups (v4) ===

doesn't receive feedback.

=== Massive improvents to rebase and cherry-pick (v6) ===

People make a fuss that Ruby support is no-go because we need to move scripts
to C, and when somebody does the work for that, the work gets ignored, even

=== Support for Ruby (v2) ===
