In Finland and Sweden Andrea without the "s" is a girls name, while 
Andreas with the "s" (or André without "-as") is a boy.

It's not even very rare. "Andrea" was the 84th most popular female name in 
Sweden in 2000.

It can be confusing, since in Italy (and, I think, southern Germany and 
much of Eastern Europe), "Andrea" is a boy, and in fact, the name 
originally comes from the Greek meaning "man".

In the rest of the world, Andrea seems to mostly female, but it probably 
depends on where the cultural influences come from.

So leaving off the "s" can be very strange to the recipient.
