Yeah, my normal process here is to dig to the bottom of the rabbit hole,
and then break it into actual patches. I just shared the middle state
here. ;)

I suspect the http bits could be split off into their own thing. The
bits in sha1-file.c I'd plan to mostly do all together, as they are
a family of related functions.

Mostly I wasn't sure how to wrap this up with the other changes. It's
obviously pretty invasive, and I don't want it to get in the way of
actual functional changes we've been discussing.

read_object_file() is about reading an object from _any_ source. These
are specifically about loose objects, and I think that distinction is
important (both here and for map_loose_object, etc).

I'd actually argue that read_object_file() should just be read_object(),
but that already exists. Sigh. (I think it's fixable, but obviously
orthogonal to this topic).

Thanks, fixed.

Yep, fixed.

It makes more sense in the pairing of unpack_sha1_header() and
unpack_sha1_rest(). Maybe "body" would be better than "rest".

At any rate, it probably makes sense to rename them together (but I
didn't touch the "header" one here). Maybe the name changes should come
as a separate patch. I was mostly changing them here because I was
changing the signatures anyway, and had to touch all of the callers.
