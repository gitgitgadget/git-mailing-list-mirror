More generally, "git pull"'s params are passed to "git fetch", and then
we either "git merge" or "git rebase".

This proposed behavior doesn't fit into that at all.

But it would if we added a third mode, similar to how we added "rebase",
where we'd dispatch to "reset" instead, so:

    git pull --reset --hard

Meaning (in the general case):

    git fetch &&
    git reset --hard @{u}
