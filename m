But incorrect whitespace is never highlighted in removed lines, why 
should CR be an exception?

But this is not limited to CR at EOL:

-<SP><TAB>something
+<SP><TAB>something_new

will also show the incorrect whitespace highlighted only for the + line.

Same here for other cases, for example

-something<SP>
+something

will not have on obvious indicator that whitespace was corrected.

If you are worried about a change in EOL style, you should better listen 
to your other tools. Either it is important, or it is not. If it is, 
they will report it to you. If it isn't, why care?
