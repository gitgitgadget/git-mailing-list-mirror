I'd be OK with keeping it if we could reduce the number of magic
numbers. E.g,. rather than 32 elsewhere use:

  (sizeof(*loose_objects_subdir_bitmap) * CHAR_BIT)

and similarly rather than 8 here use

  256 / sizeof(*loose_objects_subdir_bitmap) / CHAR_BIT

There's also already a bitmap data structure in ewah/bitmap.c. It's a
little bit overkill, though, because it mallocs and will grow the bitmap
as needed.

Sorry, I didn't mean disabling it for a particular run of a program. I
just meant that we know this is an OK tradeoff for short-sha1 lookups,
but has_sha1_file(), for example, would never want to use it. So we are
warning programmers from using it in more code, not giving users a way
to turn it off run-to-run.

Yes. You're welcome to micro-optimize that implementation if you want. ;)
