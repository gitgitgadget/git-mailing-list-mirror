Well, it depends on what you mean by "boost"...  As discussed in patch
4's commit message, this series doesn't really optimizes much, and the
total amount of work to be done remains the same, except that 'git log
-L... -<N>' will be able to return early.  So when you benchmark it
with e.g. 'time git log -L... >/dev/null', then you won't see much
difference, as it will still take just about as looooong as before,
apart from the faster generation numbers-based topo-ordering.  (But I
have a few WIP patches waiting to be cleaned up that might bring about
3-4x speedup in general.)

In the meantime, until these changes trickle into a Git release, for a
faster line-level log I would recommend to:

  - Limit the revision range up front, i.e.:

      git log -L... ^a-not-too-old-version

    because this can greatly reduce the amount of commits that that
    expensive preprocessing step has to churn through.

  - Use '--no-renames'.  Although it won't follow the evolution of the
    line range over file renames, this might be an acceptable
    compromise.  (this is what those WIP patches are focusing on)

  - Or both.
