The process is _not_ a lot of work.  At least no more than any other

Many/most regular git contributors are not Linux kernel developers, yet
were able to quickly able to get up-to-speed with git.  AFAIK, the Linux
kernel gets plenty of new contributors every year, too.

We do take time to help new contributors out :)

For me, it's certainly "no" if there's any endorsement of
non-Free Software or centralized/commercial services involved.
