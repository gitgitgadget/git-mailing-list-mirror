It MAY not get updated, since $Id$ tags are per-file instead of per-project.

Per-file revision tags are stupid and useless for anything but a one-file
project.

Considering the successes of the wars on alcohol, poverty, drugs and
terror, I think we should give some serious thought to declaring war
on peace.
