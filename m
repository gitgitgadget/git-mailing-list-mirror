I think "What's cooking" makes lots of sense in its current form
as one gets a very good overview over current development tracks.

Maybe in addition it would be nice to email the author(s) of a
series when the state changes or new comments are added (and to
only include the relevant part from "What's cooking" there). For
me it's not a big problem as I just have to grep for "submodule"
to get the bits I care about, but I suspect others might have to
invest much more time to check the current state of their series
and may appreciate being mailed directly when something happens.
Opinions?
