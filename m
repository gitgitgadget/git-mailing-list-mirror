I'm running these tests under --stress now, but not seeing the error
you saw.

However, I do have a theory: the process exits before flushing the
packet line. Adding this line before exit(1) should fix it:

	packet_writer_flush(writer);

I can send this in a v2, but it would be nice if you could test this
in your environment that already demonstrated the failure.
