This is only true if we're calling update-cache on all unchanged files.
If that's what git is doing then we're in trouble anyway.

Remember that prior to the collision check we've already spent the
effort in

1) Compressing the file.
2) Computing a SHA1 hash on the result.

These two steps together (especially the first one) is much more
expensive than a file content comparison of the blob versus what's
already in the tree.

Somehow I have a hard time seeing how this can be at all efficient if
we're compressing all checked out files including those which are
unchanged.

Therefore the only conclusion I can draw is that we're only calling
update-cache on the set of changed files, or at most a small superset
of them.  In that case, the cost of the collision check *is* proportional
to the size of the change.
