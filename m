In my opinion being able to view it online has its advantages.
Even casual reader can check it, and point errors or offer suggestions
for improvements.

I think you can share a folder instead, and this would be stable.
Alternatively, when updating the book you could update the link
in the GitHub repository description and/or the README for the
fork.

Well, https://git.github.io/htmldocs/git.html is on GitHub Pages
(for a project, that is in https://github.com/git/git.github.io repo
that is also used for Git Rev News), and it obviously uses AsciiDoc.

You can use Jekyll, or you can just upload HTML, as described
in https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually/
(this one is for per-repo GitHub Pages, i.e. using orphan branch
gh-pages, not a special named repository like e.g. git.github.io).
After each change / release you would need to rebuild HTML version
and upload to GitHub pages. This can be automated with hooks.

BTW. I thought that Pro Git used Markdown, not AsciiDoc?

All right. One issue I have after browsing through changes is that
description of changes and their granularity is severely lacking.
"A few more very minor changes.", "More piddly changes.", "should have
included this in last commit" are not good commit messages.

If I find time to comment on changes, I would do that on GitHub,
commenting / adding notes on changes there (like the one I posted
as demo: 
  https://github.com/nobozo/progit2/commit/43ae203c2ccf1a017153de1b41a8c47eb166dba1#commitcomment-18372006
