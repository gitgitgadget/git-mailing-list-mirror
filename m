Right, that would be a better check.

OK.

I don't think we can parse right away without regressing the error
handling. If I have two remotes, one with a bogus refspec, like:

  [remote "one"]
  url = ...
  fetch = refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/one/*
  [remote "two"]
  url = ...
  fetch = ***bogus***

and I do:

  git fetch one

then read_config() will grab the data for _both_ of them, but only call
remote_get() on the first one. If we parsed the refspecs during
read_config(), we'd parse the bogus remote.two.fetch and die().

I guess that's a minor case, but as far as I can tell that's the
motivation for the lazy parsing.
