The original explanation was given by Dr. Stolee and he might not have
thought exhaustively about the issue.

In any case, your explanation and the history make sense to me. I will
try to add test and report back to the mailing list if something goes
wrong.

Thank you for clarifying in such detail.

I think it's better to *not* write generation data chunk if
GIT_TEST_COMMIT_GRAPH_NO_GDAT is set even though all GDAT-less layers
are merged, that is:

  if (!ctx->write_generation_data &&
      g->chunk_generation_data &&
     !git_env_bool(GIT_TEST_COMMIT_GRAPH_NO_GDAT, 0))
    ctx->write_generation_data = 1;

With this change, we would have a method to force-write commit-graph
without generation data chunk regardless of the shape of split
commit-graph files.

I cannot think of a more appropriate struct than `struct commit_graph`. 
Any particular suggestions?

Right, both instances of "EOM" are actually my own. I looked up some
test script for oid cache that did use EOM when I first wrote the tests
but it's changed now. Will replace.

While I cannot avoid changing directory, using a subshell would be best
to avoid causing the later tests to start in unexpected directories.

We could check the written commit-graph file at this point but it's same
as existing tests as above.

`test_merge` is used in 26 places whereas `git merge` is used in over a
thousand places. `test_merge` is just not widely adopted and this lack
of adoption prevents further use.

We don't need such a complicated shape. Any commit-graph file with 2-3
layers regardless of how commits are related should suffice. Will
simplify.

The tests look indented to me and `git diff HEAD^ --check` gives nothing.

Did you mean the lines enclosed by EOF delimiter?

The problem here is graph_read_expect() as defined in
t5324-split-commit-graph takes two parameters - number of commits and
number of base graphs. If the number of base graphs is not passed to
the function call, it's assumed to be zero. Using a default parameter
is tricky - I can fix it by manually adding a zero to each of 
graph_read_expect() in an additional preparatory patch.

Any other suggestions are welcome too.

This test is meant to check writing to a split graph in "normal"
conditions (i.e. all existing layers have generation data chunk). The
above tests are special cases as they involve merging layers with mixed 
generation number versions.

It wouldn't be too hard. 

After the last test, I can write some more commits and write split 
commit-graph file without GDAT chunk. Then write some more commits 
and merge layers using `git commit-graph write --max-commits=<nr>`.

Thanks for pointing this out!
