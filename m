[+cc Junio; this patch looks good to me, and should go on top of

Thanks, nicely explained.

Yep, thanks for mentioning this, as it's somewhat subtle.

When I wrote that, I thought the fix would just be:

  if (obj_type == OBJ_TAG)
	parse_object(...);

which really would put it only one line off of your fix. :)

Nope, I'm just dumb. I wrote what I sent in the other email (rather than
just adding the "if" as above) because it only involved having a single
parse_object() call in the function. To my credit, I did realize about
an hour after sending the other email that I had in fact done the
"better thing" quite accidentally. But I really like how you explained
it in the commit message here, which I had not quite thought through.

Patch looks good. Thanks for noticing the problem and cleaning up my
mess.
