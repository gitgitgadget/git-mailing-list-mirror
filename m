Sure, that makes sense. Will add.

Right, I should have mentioned this change (and it's not something that
makes a difference either way).

We call commit_gen_cmp() only when we are sorting commits by generation
to speed up computation of Bloom filters i.e. while writing a commit
graph (either split commit-graph or a simple commit-graph).

Since we are always computing and storing corrected commit date when we
are writing (whether we write a GDAT chunk or not), using date as
heuristic is longer required.

We need the 'timestamp_t' as we are comparing level with the now 64-bits
GENERATION_NUMBER_INFINITY. I thought uint32_t would be promoted to
timestamp_t. I have a hunch that since we are explicitly using a fixed
width data type, compiler is unwilling to type coerce into broader data
types.

Advice on this appreciated.

Alright, so the above block still makes sense if we are working with
topological levels but not with corrected commit dates. Instead of
removing it, I will modify the condition to check that one of our parents
has GENERATION_NUMBER_V1_MAX and the graph uses topological levels.

Suprised that no test breaks by this change.

I have also moved changes in the verify function to the next patch, as
we cannot write or read corrected commit dates yet - so little sense in
modifying verify.
