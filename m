I could finally reproduce the issue on my own machine, so apparently
it's not an issue in Travis CI's multi-arch environments.

I wanted to report the issue to Travis CI, and in order to do so I
turned the above test case into a script that doesn't at all depend on
out test framework and 'test-tool' but uses only coreutils commands
(with a whole lot of GNUisms...):

  cat >timestamp.sh <<-\EOF
  #!/bin/sh
  
  set -ex
  
  i=0
  while true
  do
  	printf "$i\r"
  	i=$((i + 1))
  
  	# set a file's mtime to one second ago
  	now=$(date "+%s.%N")
  	one_sec_ago=$(date -d "@$((${now%.*} - 1))" "+%Y%m%d%H%M%S")
  	touch -t ${one_sec_ago%??}.${one_sec_ago#????????????} file
  	# save its actual mtime
  	old=$(date -r file "+%s.%N")
  	# set its mtime to now
  	touch file
  	# the current the mtime should be different, but sometimes it isn't
  	new=$(date -r file "+%s.%N")
  	test "${old%.*}" != "${new%.*}"
  done
  EOF
  chmod u+x timestamp.sh
  ./timestamp.sh 2>out
  echo
  tail -n11 out

And this script usually fails after a few hundred iterations on my
machine:

  308
  + date +%s.%N
  + now=1584118408.002458987
  + date -d @1584118407 +%Y%m%d%H%M%S
  + one_sec_ago=20200313175327
  + touch -t 202003131753.27 file
  + date -r file +%s.%N
  + old=1584118407.000000000
  + touch file
  + date -r file +%s.%N
  + new=1584118407.997464837
  + test 1584118407 != 1584118407

Note that the mtime update at the end of the iteration results in an
mtime that is _before_ the current time at the beginning of the
iteration.  Well, I'm puzzled :)

Yes, setting the old timestamp 2 seconds in the past seems to be
sufficient, at least I haven't seen it fail in a few 100k repetitions.
