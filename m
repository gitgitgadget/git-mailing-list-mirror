The Google Summer of Code 2012 application process is underway. We have
participated for the past 5 years, so I assume we want to do so again.

If you don't know what GSoC is, read this:

  https://code.google.com/soc/

I've volunteered to be the organization admin again, but I would be
happy to step aside if somebody else wants to do it. I've started things
off by posting a draft of our application and starting a wiki page for
project ideas:

  https://github.com/peff/git/wiki/SoC-2012-Application

  https://github.com/peff/git/wiki/SoC-2012-Ideas

The application is due March 9th (next Friday).

At this point, we need:

  1. Somebody to volunteer as a backup admin.

  2. Project ideas to be added to the ideas page.

  3. Volunteers to mentor students.  Our criteria for mentors in the
     past has been to accept only those who have a history of
     contributing to git. But if you have an idea for a project and
     don't feel that you would be capable of mentoring, please feel free
     to start a discussion on the list. You may interest other people
     who can volunteer to mentor for it.

  4. People to read over the application and suggest improvements. It's
     adapted from last year's application. The general meaning should be
     the same, though I did bring it up to date as well clean up a few
     awkward bits.

In the past, we've used the kernel.org wiki for developing the SoC
materials. However, it's still not editable, and I don't think we have a
plan for what the "new" git wiki will be. I've put things up on this
GitHub wiki in the meantime; they can be migrated to an official wiki if
and when that happens.

I think you'll need a GitHub login to edit the wiki pages via the web
interface. You can also clone it here:

  git://github.com/peff/git.wiki.git

and I will be happy to take patches on the list.
