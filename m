 + Merge branch 'bb/ssh-key-files' of git-gui into bb/git-gui-ssh-key-files
 + git-gui: search for all current SSH key types

 "git gui" learned that "~/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub" and
 "~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub" are also possible SSH key files.


* bp/fsmonitor-bufsize-fix (2018-04-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-17 at 70a7091e06)
 + fsmonitor: fix incorrect buffer size when printing version number

 Fix an unexploitable (because the oversized contents are not under
 attacker's control) buffer overflow.


* bp/fsmonitor-prime-index (2018-04-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-17 at 765edccdf0)
 + fsmonitor: force index write after full scan

 The index file is updated to record the fsmonitor section after a
 full scan was made, to avoid wasting the effort that has already
 spent.


* bp/git-gui-bind-kp-enter (2018-03-02) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-17 at 35828e90e2)
 + Merge branch 'bp/bind-kp-enter' of git-gui into bp/git-gui-bind-kp-enter
 + git-gui: bind CTRL/CMD+numpad ENTER to do_commit

 "git gui" performs commit upon CTRL/CMD+ENTER but the
 CTRL/CMD+KP_ENTER (i.e. enter key on the numpad) did not have the
 same key binding.  It now does.


* br/mergetools-guiffy (2018-04-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-17 at 8ec0697d5d)

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-17 at 1e56bbc14d)
 + commit: allow partial commits with relative paths

 "cd sub/dir && git commit ../path" ought to record the changes to
 the file "sub/path", but this regressed long time ago.


* cb/bash-completion-ls-files-processing (2018-04-10) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-17 at 956b155366)
 + completion: improve ls-files filter performance

 Shell completion (in contrib) that gives list of paths have been
 optimized somewhat.


* cb/git-gui-ttk-style (2018-03-05) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-17 at 1a4f677a0d)
 + Merge branch 'cb/ttk-style' of git-gui into cb/git-gui-ttk-style
 + git-gui: workaround ttk:style theme use

 "git gui" has been taught to work with old versions of tk (like
 8.5.7) that do not support "ttk::style theme use" as a way to query
 the current theme.


* cc/perf-bisect (2018-04-11) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-17 at 62a1498dd0)

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-17 at 538601fef3)
 + configure.ac: fix botched FREAD_READS_DIRECTORIES check

 Small fix to the autoconf build procedure.


* es/worktree-docs (2018-04-09) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-17 at 15a098e9b1)
 + git-worktree.txt: unify command-line prompt in example blocks
 + git-worktree.txt: recommend 'git worktree remove' over manual deletion
 (this branch uses nd/worktree-move.)

 Doc updates.


* jk/flockfile-stdio (2018-03-30) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-17 at e11bd565f4)
 + config: move flockfile() closer to unlocked functions

 Code clean-up.


* jk/ref-array-push (2018-04-09) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-17 at 61859b271b)
 + ref-filter: factor ref_array pushing into its own function
 + ref-filter: make ref_array_item allocation more consistent

 + set_work_tree: use chdir_notify
 + add chdir-notify API
 + trace.c: export trace_setup_key
 + set_git_dir: die when setenv() fails

 Some codepaths, including the refs API, get and keep relative
 paths, that go out of sync when the process does chdir(2).  The
 chdir-notify API is introduced to let these codepaths adjust these
 cached paths to the new current directory.


* jk/t5561-missing-curl (2018-04-05) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-17 at d8592fa6c2)
 + t5561: skip tests if curl is not available
 + t5561: drop curl stderr redirects

 Test fixes.


* jm/mem-pool (2018-04-12) 3 commits

 + mem-pool: move reusable parts of memory pool into its own file
 + fast-import: introduce mem_pool type
 + fast-import: rename mem_pool type to mp_block

 An reusable "memory pool" implementation has been extracted from
 fast-import.c, which in turn has become the first user of the
 mem-pool API.


* js/t5404-path-fix (2018-04-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-17 at 94092f2896)
 + t5404: relax overzealous test

 Test fix.


* ks/branch-list-detached-rebase-i (2018-04-05) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-17 at 5c2842c3f9)
 + t3200: verify "branch --list" sanity when rebasing from detached HEAD
 + branch --list: print useful info whilst interactive rebasing a detached HEAD

 "git branch --list" during an interrupted "rebase -i" now lets
 users distinguish the case where a detached HEAD is being rebased
 and a normal branch is being rebased.


* lw/daemon-log-destination (2018-04-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-17 at b06cdcc45e)
 + daemon.c: fix condition for redirecting stderr

 Recent introduction of "--log-destination" option to "git daemon"
 did not work well when the daemon was run under "--inetd" mode.


* mn/send-email-credential-doc (2018-04-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-17 at c4db21eb9b)
 + send-email: simplify Gmail example in the documentation

 Doc update.

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-17 at 11ca393110)
 + t2028: tighten grep expression to make "move worktree" test more robust
 (this branch is used by es/worktree-docs.)

 Test update.

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-17 at dcb138d8b1)
 + t/helper: 'test-chmtime (--get|-g)' to print only the mtime

 Test cleanup.


* pw/rebase-keep-empty-fixes (2018-03-29) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-17 at 10a4d92060)
 + rebase: respect --no-keep-empty
 + rebase -i --keep-empty: don't prune empty commits
 + rebase --root: stop assuming squash_onto is unset
 (this branch is used by pw/rebase-signoff.)

 "git rebase --keep-empty" still removed an empty commit if the
 other side contained an empty commit (due to the "does an
 equivalent patch exist already?" check), which has been corrected.


* pw/rebase-signoff (2018-03-29) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-17 at fbdc16e20e)
 + rebase --keep-empty: always use interactive rebase
 + rebase -p: error out if --signoff is given
 + rebase: extend --signoff support
 + Merge branch 'pw/rebase-keep-empty-fixes' into pw/rebase-signoff
 (this branch uses pw/rebase-keep-empty-fixes.)

 "git rebase" has learned to honor "--signoff" option when using
 backends other than "am" (but not "--preserve-merges").


* sb/filenames-with-dashes (2018-04-11) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-17 at 45fdeb5cb1)
 + replace_object.c: rename to use dash in file name
 + sha1_file.c: rename to use dash in file name
 + sha1_name.c: rename to use dash in file name

 Rename bunch of source files to more consistently use dashes
 instead of underscores to connect words.


* tg/use-git-contacts (2018-04-12) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-17 at 26cf8c1d8c)
 + SubmittingPatches: mention the git contacts command

  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-25 at 0367d52a4b)
 + worktree: accept -f as short for --force for removal

 "git worktree remove" learned that "-f" is a shorthand for
 "--force" option, just like for "git worktree add".

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sg/completion-clear-cached (2018-04-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-25 at 9178da6c3d)
 + completion: reduce overhead of clearing cached --options

 The completion script (in contrib/) learned to clear cached list of
 command line options upon dot-sourcing it again in a more efficient
 way.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* sg/doc-gc-quote-mismatch-fix (2018-04-18) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2018-04-25 at bc3d1abf45)
 + docs/git-gc: fix minor rendering issue

 Doc formatting fix.

 Will merge to 'master'.


* js/ident-date-fix (2018-04-19) 1 commit
 - sequencer: reset the committer date before commits

 During a "rebase -i" session, the code could give older timestamp
 to commits created by later "pick" than an earlier "reword", which
 has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* nd/submodule-status-fix (2018-04-19) 1 commit
 - submodule--helper: don't print null in 'submodule status'

 "git submodule status" did not check the symbolic revision name it
 computed for the submodule HEAD is not the NULL, and threw it at
 printf routines, which has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* sa/send-email-dedup-some-headers (2018-04-19) 1 commit
 - send-email: avoid duplicate In-Reply-To/References

 When fed input that already has In-Reply-To: and/or References:
 headers and told to add the same information, "git send-email"
 added these headers separately, instead of appending to an existing
 one, which is a violation of the RFC.  This has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* tg/demote-stash-save-in-completion (2018-04-20) 2 commits
 - completion: make stash -p and alias for stash push -p
 - completion: stop showing 'save' for stash by default

 THe command line completion (in contrib/) has been taught that "git
 stash save" has been deprecated ("git stash push" is the preferred
 spellingin the new world) and does not offer it as a possible
 completion candidate when "git stash push" can be.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* tz/doc-git-urls-reference (2018-04-20) 1 commit
 - doc/clone: update caption for GIT URLS cross-reference

 Doc fix.

 - replace: "libify" create_graft() and callees
 - replace: avoid using die() to indicate a bug
 - commit: Let the callback of for_each_mergetag return on error
 - argv_array: offer to split a string by whitespace

 The functionality of "$GIT_DIR/info/grafts" has been superseded by
 the "refs/replace/" mechanism for some time now, but the internal
 code had support for it in many places, which has been cleaned up
 in order to drop support of the "grafts" mechanism.


* js/rebase-i-clean-msg-after-fixup-continue (2018-04-24) 4 commits
 - rebase --skip: clean up commit message after a failed fixup/squash
 - sequencer: leave a tell-tale when a fixup/squash failed
 - rebase -i: Handle "combination of <n> commits" with GETTEXT_POISON
 - rebase -i: demonstrate bugs with fixup!/squash! commit messages

 "git rebase -i" sometimes left intermediate "# This is a
 combination of N commits" message meant for the human consumption
 inside an editor in the final result in certain corner cases, which
 has been fixed.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* ma/fast-export-skip-merge-fix (2018-04-21) 1 commit
 - fast-export: fix regression skipping some merge-commits

 "git fast-export" had a regression in v2.15.0 era where it skipped

* jc/parseopt-expiry-errors (2018-04-23) 2 commits
 - parseopt: handle malformed --expire arguments more nicely
 - gc: do not upcase error message shown with die()

 "git gc --prune=nonsense" spent long time repacking and then
 silently failed when underlying "git prune --expire=nonsense"
 failed to parse its command line.  This has been corrected.

 Will merge to 'next'.


* js/colored-push-errors (2018-04-24) 4 commits
 - config: document the settings to colorize push errors/hints
 - push: test to verify that push errors are colored
 - push: colorize errors

* js/runtime-prefix (2018-04-24) 8 commits
 - Avoid multiple PREFIX definitions
 - git_setup_gettext: plug memory leak

 - walker: drop fields of `struct walker` which are always 1
 - http-fetch: make `-a` standard behaviour

 "git http-fetch" (deprecated) had an optional and experimental
 "feature" to fetch only commits and/or trees, which nobody used.
 This has been removed.

 Will merge to 'next'.

 custom "git-$command" that the end user has on the $PATH when using

 "git config --unset a.b", when "a.b" is the last variable in an
 otherwise empty section "a", left an empty section "a" behind, and
 worse yet, a subsequent "git config a.c value" did not reuse that
 empty shell and instead created a new one.  These have been

 + builtin/config.c: treat type specifiers singularly
 (this branch is used by tb/config-default.)

 The "git config" command uses separate options e.g. "--int",
 "--bool", etc. to specify what type the caller wants the value to
 be interpreted as.  A new "--type=<typename>" option has been
 introduced, which would make it cleaner to define new types.

 + config.c: introduce 'git_config_color' to parse ANSI colors
 + builtin/config: introduce `--default`
 (this branch uses tb/config-type.)

 "git config --get" learned the "--default" option, to help the
 calling script.  Building on top of the tb/config-type topic, the
 "git config" learns "--type=color" type.  Taken together, you can
 do things like "git config --get foo.color --default blue" and get
 the ANSI color sequence for the color given to foo.color variable,
 or "blue" if the variable does not exist.

 Will wait on the tb/config-type topic.

 + t3200: unset core.logallrefupdates when testing reflog creation
 (this branch is used by jk/branch-l-1-removal and jk/branch-l-2-reincarnation.)

 The "-l" option in "git branch -l" is an unfortunate short-hand for
 "--create-reflog", but many users, both old and new, somehow expect
 it to be something else, perhaps "--list".  This step deprecates
 the short-hand and warns about the future removal of the it when it

 - pack-objects: turn type and in_pack_type to bitfields
 - pack-objects: a bit of document about struct object_entry

 "git pack-objects" needs to allocate tons of "struct object_entry"
 while doing its work, and shrinking its size helps the performance
 quite a bit.

 What's the doneness of this thing?  The interdiff since previous
 rounds looked reasonable, but I didn't see this round otherwise

 - gc: add --keep-largest-pack option
 - repack: add --keep-pack option
 - t7700: have closing quote of a test at the beginning of line

 "git gc" in a large repository takes a lot of time as it considers
 to repack all objects into one pack by default.  The command has
 been taught to pretend as if the largest existing packfile is
 marked with ".keep" so that it is left untouched while objects in
 other packs and loose ones are repacked.

 one looked reasonable, but I didn't see this round otherwise
 scrutinized by reviewers.

 This looked more or less ready for 'next'.  Please stop me if there
 are remaining issues I forgot about.

* js/runtime-prefix-windows (2018-03-27) 5 commits
 . mingw/msvc: use the new-style RUNTIME_PREFIX helper
 . exec_cmd: provide a new-style RUNTIME_PREFIX helper for Windows
 . exec_cmd: RUNTIME_PREFIX on some POSIX systems
 . Makefile: add Perl runtime prefix support
 . Makefile: generate Perl header from template file

 The Windows port was the first that allowed Git to be installed
 anywhere by having its components refer to each other with relative
 pathnames.  The recent dj/runtime-prefix topic extends the idea to
 other platforms, and its approach has been adopted back in the
 Windows port.

 Ejected, as the parent topic dj/runtime-prefix covers Windows now.


* bp/fsexcludes (2018-04-16) 2 commits
 . fsmonitor: switch to use new fsexcludes logic and remove unused untracked cache based logic
 . fsexcludes: add a programmatic way to exclude files from git's working directory traversal logic

 Can we have a few lines summary here, just like we have for other
 topic ;-) I personally take the overlong title of these commits as
 a sign that they can further be simplified and cleaned up by
 splitting, focusing the scope, etc.

 Retracted.
