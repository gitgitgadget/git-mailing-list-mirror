Totally agreed, thanks for pointing this out.  Will be fixed in v3.

Yes, I was already aware that such indentation ends up wasted, but 
having
it makes the test a bit more readable.  At least in my opinion, but if 
you
find it better not to have such whitespace, for the sake of consistency,
I'll happily remove this indentation in the v3.

Well, resorting to always not having such instances of 'X' to provide
leading indentation in test configuration files may actually make some
bugs go undetected in some tests.  To me, having leading indentation is
to be expected in the real configuration files in the field, thus 
providing
the same indentation in a test configuration feels natural to me, 
despite
admittedly making the test configuration a bit less readable.

Of course, consistency is good, but variety is also good when it comes
to automated tests.  I'm not very familiar with the tests in git, so
please let me know if consistency outweights variety in this case, and
I'll happily remove the leading "X" indentations in the v3.

The v3 is already inevitable, so I'll drop this change.

Thanks. :)
