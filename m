I want to share code with a few co-workers and I want to use git.

I installed git (cygwin), created a /project/ and then $cd project
and then $git init

I have found so much documentation as to what to do next, that
I'm confused.

Do I have to create an account on github in order to share code with
a few local developers?

Could I run some sort of server on my laptop in order to share code?
(we only need to share during office hours).  Basically I just
want to share code but do not want to sign up for an account
on github.

How do I work this?

thanks
