No wonder it was so nicely explained. ;)

I think this is quite a reasonable thing to do. Since we're trying to
clean up, in theory we would like to hook any signal death, but these
three are the common ones in practice. We handle QUIT and PIPE as well
in our C code; the latter isn't an issue here. SIGQUIT is a possibility,
I guess, but seems rather unlikely.
