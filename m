not sure I follow, but the current code (as well as the one after patch 1)
just silently ignores any credential that was missing username and password
since the _gently version of the call will only really fail for a missing
protocol.

so patch1 will notify ONLY(*) when the credential is so malformed that we can't
figure out which protocol to use (like empty lines and comments)

(*) it will also fail if we have a '\n' in one of the components but that
is hopefully not relevant here.

I think it will be clearer with the reformatting you suggested and that I
agree is needed, but wanted to make sure first that we agreed on the direction.

FWIW the test cases show the format of the lines affected and while they are
parseable enough that were processed they were obviously not valid, specially
considering the updated rules.

maybe we should make the _gently version less gently instead?, so that callers
will be able to know they have an incomplete credential for matching after
calling it without having to do their own check?

if the later, I am affraid this will be a far bigger change, which is why I
would rather duplicate the rule checking for at least the first iteration.
