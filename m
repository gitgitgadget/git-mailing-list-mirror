Hello,

My name is Boris Sieklik and I am a third year student in Computer
Networks at Middlesex University in London.

I am writing in interest to participate in GSoC 2012.

I was participating in GSoC 2011 - Network Time Protocol. I was
studying different clock models by implementing phase and
frequency-locked loops and observing their behaviour.

I have checked the ideas pages and I believe that my skills would suit
perfectly for the Keyboard Shortcuts to Improve Accessibility idea. I
have extensive network and programming knowledge and the idea itself
is really interesting. My JAVA and andorid skills are quite strong, in
fact most of my last year GSoC project was done in JAVA.

I just would like to ask, do you have any special requirements for a
student to fulfil? Should I provide you with any additional
information other than project proposal?

Could you also tell me little bit more about this project idea?

Thank you.

Kind Regards,

Boris Sieklik
