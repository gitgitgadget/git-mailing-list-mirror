If it's been broken since the start, I think having a reference to
94bcad7979 isn't interesting, but "this behavior has been broken since
its introduction" is.

:-). Interesting detail, too, and probably worth noting in the commit
message.

Feel free to discard this suggestion in favor of what Phillip is
proposing, though.

Thanks for the detailed analysis. Makes sense.
