That should be dropping everything that isn't reachable. I'd suggest to
expire reflogs, though it looks like you've also tried "git gc" with
reflog expiration. Does removing .git/logs entirely help?

If not, are you sure it isn't actually reachable from your history? What
does:

  git rev-list --all --objects | grep 00009623a06

say? If no hits, does adding --reflogs to the command-line change it?

We also consider blobs in the index reachable. I don't recall offhand
whether that applies to trees mentioned by the cache-trees extension. I
don't _think_ that would apply to your broken tree, since they'd have
been generated by Git itself, but possibly removing .git/index (if this
isn't a bare repo) would help?
