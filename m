Anyway good going, I am glad Linux has an open source VCS again now.

I do not know how BitKeeper are going to fell knowing they have been 
replaced by a Git :)

I am toying with using a VCS for a set of related projects, either CVS 
because its well known, SubVersion for ease of use, or Git as it is new. 
Lots to descide upon, any pointers would be appreciated.

All the best to the Git team.

Regards,

Aaron
