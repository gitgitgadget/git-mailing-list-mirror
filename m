Oops. I had seen this and thought I had installed it properly a while
ago, (copied it to /etc/bash_completion.d/git), but I hadn't realized
it wasn't active in the shell I used to test while composing that
email.

Yes, I think we'd all be better off if we could designate some subset
of the current git commands as not being intended for users to type on
the command line and pulled them out of the completion scripts.

It is tough though. Looking through what's available in the short list
from "git --help" I notice that update-index isn't there, and that's
currently still required, (as we've been discussing here). But even
things as "core plumbing" as git rev-list I find extremely useful on
the command like with simple pipelines.

On the other hand, there are definitely some commands I've never
typed, and are not intended to be typed by the user. Here are a few I
see as fairly obvious just from skimming the list:

	merge-*
	http-*
	ssh-*
	upload-*
	mktag
	mktree
	check-ref-format
	...

There are a bunch of others as well. Maybe it would be easier to start
with the list in git --help and see what should be added to that.

The documentation for some of the above commands have phrases such as
"Invoked by <other command>" and "usually not invoked by the end user"
which does make the distinction quite clear. So it would be nice if
git could keep these away from the user more.
