I find the patch generation very usefull (when I've seen the tool a few days ago, I've said to myself:
"what a wonderfull tool, if only I could create a patch from this")
but it doesn't work for me (the first three entries stay always in grey, only the last one "Create tag" is in black).
I'm missing something ?
