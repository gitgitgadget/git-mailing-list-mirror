Hi all,
I was wondering whether it could be a good idea to have a kind of "GIT
users survey" when google pointed my eyes to this page:
http://www.selenic.com/pipermail/mercurial/2006-April/007513.html

So I modified the content of the survey and published a DRAF here:
http://paolo.ciarrocchi.googlepages.com/GITSurvey

Here is the content of the proposed survey:

About you

    1. What country are you in?
    2. What is your preferred language?
    3. What's your gender?

Getting started with GIT

    1. How did you hear about GIT?
    2. Did you find GIT easy to learn?
    3. What helped you most in learning to use it?

How you use GIT

    1. Do you use GIT for work, unpaid projects, or both?
    2. How do you obtain GIT?  Source tarball, binary package, or
       pull the main repository?
    3. What platforms (hardware, OS, version) do you use GIT on?
    4. How many people do you collaborate with using GIT?
    5. How big are the repositories that you work on? (e.g. how many
       files, how much disk space)
    6. How many different projects do you manage using GIT?
    7. Which extensions/plugins do you use?

What you think of GIT

    1. Overall, how happy are you with GIT?
    2. How does GIT compare to other SCM tools you have used?
    3. What do you like about using GIT?
    4. What would you most like to see improved about GIT?
       (features, bugs, plugins, documentation, ...)
    5. If you want to see GIT more widely used, what do you
       think we could do to make this happen?

Documentation

    1. Do you use the GIT wiki?   If yes, do you find it useful?
    2. Do you find GIT's online help useful?
    3. What is your favourite user documentation for any software
       projects or products you have used?

Getting help, staying in touch

    1. Have you tried to get GIT help from other people?
          * If yes, did you get these problems resolved quickly and to
            your liking?
    2. Do you subscribe to the mailing list?
          * If yes, do you find it useful, and traffic levels OK?
    3. Do you use the IRC channel (#git on irc.freenode.net)?
          * If no, did you know that all of the core developers use
            IRC, and that there's almost 24-hour help available?

Open forum

    1. What other comments or suggestions do you have that are not
       covered by the questions above?


What do people living in this ML think about this suvery?
Do you have any suggestion?
Do you think it worth the effort?

Thanks in advace.

Regards,
