I'm now fairly confident that 'git merge' is OK, and suspect that it's
an issue with Travis CI's s390x environment (multi-architecture
support is an alpha-stage feature).

I kicked off a build that only runs 't6022 --stress -r 1,12', and it
failed with the same error on s390x fairly quickly, but haven't failed
in any of our "standard" CI jobs until the jobs timeouted.

  https://travis-ci.org/github/szeder/git/jobs/661647673#L2084

Then I kicked off a build to run the test below with --stress:

  test_expect_success 'test' '
  	touch file &&
  	old=$(test-tool chmtime --get =-1 file) &&
  	touch file &&
  	new=$(test-tool chmtime --get file) &&
  	test $old -lt $new
  '

This failed fairly quickly with the same error on s390x as well.

  https://travis-ci.org/github/szeder/git/jobs/661654844#L1275

So I think 'git merge' should be okay, because the failure could be
triggered without it as well.

I kicked off a build where I set an older timestamp ('=-10' instead of
'=-1'), to see what happens, but the s390x job in that build just
doesn't want to start...  (alpha feature? :)  Anyway, the job's output
should eventually be available here, will try to check back tomorrow:
