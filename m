Hi all,

Currently i want to merge one project into another git branch. For example I
have a branch name A and there is a project called p1 under folder
projects/p1/. and i have a empty branch B. i just want to merge project
"projects/p1/" into my empty branch B. But I don't want to merge other
parts(for example projects/p2). Can anyone help me please? 

Thanks a lot.
