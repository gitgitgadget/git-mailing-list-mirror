Right now we are looking for new space on the Google campus that would
allow us to get everyone in 1 room together, but also offer some
break-out space. More details as soon as I know. :-)

I'd like to keep it still somewhat unconferencey. Maybe do the morning
before lunch with everyone together and the topics that have the most
interest, and the afternoons for more breakout style smaller
discussions, especially if a subgroup identifies with something from
the morning and they want to purse that a little bit more in person.
