I think that if it's just after/before the Mentor Summit it makes no se=
nse=20
for it to be outside Mountain View. As Shawn said there are many git us=
ers=20
that will be there for the summit, so we want to make it easy for them =
to=20
attend the GitTogether.

I don't think I deserve/want to go to the Google SoC Mentor Summit but =
I=20
would apprieciate if some of the mentor money could fund some of my tra=
vel=20
expenses.

By the way I created this page on the wiki:

http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/GitTogether

If someone see things to add, please do so.

Thanks,
Christian.
