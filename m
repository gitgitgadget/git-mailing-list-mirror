So my only real concern here is that `col` itself is going to munge
whitespace.  Quoting from the col man page:

	[...] and replaces white-space characters with tabs where
	    possible. [...]

Have you actually run into a situation where something like ^L was
present in a blob that was being passed to highlight?
