This patch looks correct to me.

I'm a little lukewarm on it overall, though. I'd be shocked if the
efficiency change is measurable. What I really care about is whether the
result is easier to read or not.

On the plus side, this moves an invariant out of the loop. On the minus
side, it has to introduce an extra variable for "length we add on to"
versus "dir length to pass to the subdir_cb". That's not rocket science,
but it does slightly complicate things (though I note we already have
"origlen", so this is bumping us from 2 to 3 length variables, not 1 to
2).

So I dunno. It's fine with me if we take it, and fine if we leave it.
