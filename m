I do think the end result is a lot more readable. On gcc 6 at least, the
function seems[1] to end up inlined even with -O0.

Interestingly, at -O2 even with -DNO_UNALIGNED_LOADS, gcc converts the
result to a movl and a bswap. Which is the same thing our
unaligned-loads path is trying for. I wonder if we could/should just
drop it (that _would_ punish -O0 on x86, though).
