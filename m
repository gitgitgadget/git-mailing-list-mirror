Certainly. The first steps are helping with the project selection,
specifically:

  1. Populating the list of suggested projects (this week).

  2. Helping to review applications once they start coming in (in a
     month or so).

Because it's a non-zero time commitment, and I have many other things
I'd like to do. :)

Actually, I do not mind being the org admin too much if nobody else
wants to step up. But what I really need help on is the proposed project
list, which is part of the application (which is due on Friday). That is
not something I can fill out by myself.
