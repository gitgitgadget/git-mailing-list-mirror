What about something like:

	[includeIf "env:PATH ~= '^(.*ðŸ˜Š)/usr/bin(:.*)*$' "]

Using single quotes and a full regex pattern instead of trying to provide a syntax to extract a pattern and then match. One call to regexec() would be easier. Then escaping is regcomp's problem (mostly). Potentially, you could even remove the outer ", but that would be wonky. You could omit the ^ and $ by default assuming a full match.
