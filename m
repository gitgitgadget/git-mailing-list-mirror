Good point.  That makes clear_commit_marks_many() less useful than
advertised in e895cb5135, though.

I thought about that nuclear option as well.  It might be a good idea
for code in cmd_* and similar leaf functions for cleaning up between
unrelated stages (e.g. between parts that had been separate external
git command calls before).  They probably only load potentially
interesting objects into memory and don't need to bother much about
interactions with other functions.

But clear_object_flags() makes me nervous because it clears the flags
of all kinds of objects, not just for commits, and I can't easily
convince myself that this is safe.  Adding a version that checks the
object type would be an easy way out.
