Hi Stollee,
a few very generic points with my "systems" hat on.

We probably should also summarise the status of and relationships with
the existing 'integrations' like `git-gui`, `gitk`, `Git for-Windows`, etc.

I'm assuming that 'our' here is the corporate team that has been
endeavouring to use Git effectively on it's mega-repo and give back what
it has learnt to Git.

Here, 'scalar' is about large code mono-repos, rather than any operating
system/vendor issues, or visualisation tools. (may need saying)

How to quantify the size of the scalar _code_ contribution, and how is
concept ownership handed over?

Ensuring a separation of concerns (partitioning) will be important if
the only mega repo that can really 'battle test' the capability is to be
separate from the ownership of the coded concepts.

I'm presuming this (responsibility) is with respect to the *transition*
from the independent `scalar` to the Git integrated _scalar_ capability.

This appears to list only end points, rather than transitional
approaches (cf. cut & cover, tunnel, bridging) to providing some or all
of the scalar mono-repo capability to Git.

Are we talking ('not for debate') about the existing `scalar`
(corporate) cli or the potential for a medium term transition to a git
cli embedding the _scalar_ concepts.Â

I'm minded toward seeing a transitional approach (aka: staged, gated,
..) that would bring capability into Git, but I'm not sure about the
libgit.a linkage.
