So maybe we could use some new thing here with cleaner UI. Perhaps:

	git export

Paired with a new "git import" there would be a much more obvious way
of working for new users than "git format-patch" and "git am".

Meanwhile, I don't think export/import is the right place to do the
patch-id filtering, etc. That seems to work much better in the context
of something like StackedGit, (which I've started playing with
recently and been very impressed with). I'd really like to think about
some ways to bring some of the functionality of StackedGit into the
core tools. (We've currently got "git commit --amend" for example, but
what I often want is "git goto old-commit; #hack; git commit --amend;
git replay" or whatever, (in Stacked Git speak that is currently "stg
goto old-commit; #hack; stg refresh; stg push --all").
