Yeah, I know - that is actually why I complained to r3pek, as most of
the guys interested in doing patches, etc will prob pull and build
themselfs, but the user that just want to get the latest kernel, will
rather want cogito (or git-pasky).  So basically the git I mentioned
that I wanted added (or maybe replace the current one in the tree
depending on what r3pek do), was Petr's stuff ...


Thanks,
