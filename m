This is a general question about documentation patches:

Do you mind if people submit _very_ minimal patches for the
docs that fix only some typing errors or the like? I, personally,
am a friend of correct spelling and such and when I discover
such errors I prefer to have them fixed.

OTOH, I really don't want to bother you with such patches
that don't bring forward the "real Git" and only marginally
contribute to Git itself. I know that all of you have better
things to do than adding a punctuation mark somewhere
or checking a patch that does it.
