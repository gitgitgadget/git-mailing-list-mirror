We could start allowing "fuzz" by default in the case of a patch with more 
context than we'd expect to see. That is, git-apply would ignore context 
lines more than 3 lines away from any changed lines, sharing the 
assumption of our patch-generation side that lines that far away don't 
matter in general. (Now, if people were in the habit of including as 
context additional lines in fragile locations, this wouldn't be a good 
assumption, but I doubt anybody would be able to identify such lines to 
include them).
