Btw, I enjoy your email address and name, but especially with something 
that is supposed to hopefully have some legal value down the line if 
somebody starts making SCO noises, it really would be nice to have a real 
person to associate things with..

It would be embarrassing later if there is no way to even look you up 
somehow.

If you don't want your realname/affiliation to be public/official, maybe
you could at least let people know in private?
