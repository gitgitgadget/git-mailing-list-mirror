Yup.  In the private discussion off-list about this, I basically
agreed to be admin because Peff won't have the time, and it sounded
like Dscho wouldn't either.  So I volunteered out of default.

I think GSoC is a great program, and would love to see Git
participate again this year, and would hate for us to miss out
simply because we couldn't find someone to be the project admin.

Fortunately $DAY_JOB feels GSoC is important, and thus might cut
me a bit of slack during the peak program periods...
