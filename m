Heh. I do agree that some people just ask for unreasonable or stupid 
things (or maybe they are just really bad at explaining them, and may have 
something non-stupid in mind but just cannot articulate it).

And I also agree that there are tons of people who are just lazy and don't 
even bother to try to explain themselves.

And I'll flame people myself. I can't even say that's a rare event. So I 
shouldn't throw _too_ many stones, or one of them might bounce back. 

But at the same time, just accepting that there are people who will 
potentially never really be productive members of society (whether 
"society" is git or something bigger), is probably a good idea. They 
aren't worth complaining about: they don't generally tend to take anything 
away from the community unless the community itself reacts negatively to 
them.
