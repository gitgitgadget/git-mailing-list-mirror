But neither is uncommitted work saved anywhere when you do
`svn switch` in Subversion which is analogous to `git checkout`.

While I do know quite many people expect Git to somehow "preserve"
their work when switching branches without having them do anything,
I wonder what in Subversion workflow makes you think Git should have
had the behaviour you expected?
