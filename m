Hi Gabor,

 thanks for taking a look at these commits.

Personally, I agree with you that

However, people may start complaining that their terminal becomes too
cluttered when doing a double-Tab. In my cover letter, I go to length
about this. My assumption was that all options that are mentioned in the
introduction of the command man-page should be important enough to have
them in the completion list. I'll change my commit message accordingly.

Thanks for spotting this.

Btw, I haven't found that non-destructive options should not be eligible
for completion. To avoid confusion about this in the future, I suggest
to also change the documentation:

index 933bb6e..96f1c7f 100644

I take it you have also looked at the code itself? Then I would gladly
mention you as reviewer in my sign-off.
