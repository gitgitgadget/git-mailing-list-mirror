Thanks for a very clear and straightforward explanation of the problem

Right; here we're stuck taking the slow path. Maybe in the future that
could become faster, too, if the revision walking machinery knew how to
perform this filtering, but not today. Makes sense.

Are these 'real' times, or user/sys times?

I wouldn't be opposed to simply moving the definition of 'want_ancestry'
up here, since it is self-contained and doesn't depend on any other
definitions, except 'struct rev_info' itself, which comes from
'revision.h'.

I think that this is just a style comment at this point, but I'm not
overly attached to the last three lines of this comment. I think that
the commit message that these lines would blame down to explains the
situation quite clearly, and the reader can search for the
'!want_ancestry' call a couple hundred lines later.

That said, I certainly won't be offended if you want to keep this
comment around; I just don't think that it's strictly necessary.

All makes sense, and the ending is very satisfying. Someone with a
little more familiarity with line-log should review this also. But, for
