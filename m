Thanks for a complete reproduction. There are a few things going on
here.

The "-t" option doesn't take an argument; it's a boolean that says
"track the branch we started from". So "master" is taken as the
start-point, and "HEAD" is tacked onto the end. I.e., equivalent to:

  git checkout -b work master HEAD

That error message is wrong and misleading. It looks like what happens
is that we parse "master" as the start-point. And then we try to treat
remaining options (i.e., "HEAD") as a pathspec. That fails, because
there's no such path. But then instead of saying "hey, HEAD isn't a
pathspec" we try to be clever:

                  /*
                   * Try to give more helpful suggestion.
                   * new_branch && argc > 1 will be caught later.
                   */
                  if (opts->new_branch && argc == 1)
                          die(_("'%s' is not a commit and a branch '%s' cannot be created from it"),
                                  argv[0], opts->new_branch);

We know we're making a new branch and there's one argument, so we assume
that it didn't get parsed earlier as a start-point. But that misses the
fact that if we _did_ parse a start-point, it would have been removed
from argv, and our "single argument" is actually the former
second-argument.

Something like this works:

to produce:

  $ git checkout -b work -t master HEAD
  fatal: '--track' cannot be used with updating paths

  $ git checkout -b work master HEAD
  fatal: Cannot update paths and switch to branch 'work' at the same time.

which are both correct. I wonder if there's a more elegant way to do it,
though (probably not, as there's definitely some heuristic parsing going
on to determine which checkout mode we're in; the new switch/restore
alternatives don't suffer as much from this).

So getting back to your actual goal: you can't do what you want with a
single checkout command. I think:

  git checkout -b work HEAD
  git branch --set-upstream-to=master
