I wrote that in April, but I've never pointed anyone at it since
then. I've learned a lot since then, (and git has changed too).
One thing I've been meaning to do is to write up a more complete
introduction on using git to manage cairo's tree to put into cairo's
wiki or so, (it would have helped a newcomer like jwatt here).

I've mentioned it as an idea once or twice on this list. I've never
"pushed" for any change along these lines simply because I haven't
ever done any implementation for this.

Also, I don't actually need this. I don't use the "reset --hard"
workflow suggested in the mail above. I always obtain remote changes
with "git fetch" and then examine things locally and decide to either
merge (or fast forward) with "git pull", (though maybe I'll start
using "git merge" now), or else to use "git rebase" to avoid the noisy
merge commits.

That workflow of fetching changes and then exploring them locally
before merging is why I rarely take advantage of the combined
fetch+merge aspect of "git pull". It's exceedingly rare for me to ever
call "git pull" with any URL but ".", (though I use "git fetch" with
various URLs on a regular basis).

PS. It's funny how much easier it is to type "cario" than "cairo". I
used to do that all the time, (though in this sentence here, when I
actually _tried_ to type "cario" it came out as "cairo" the first
time). I think the "cario" typo is a Qwerty artefact---the left hand
gets all its keypresses in before the right hand gets going.
