Hi, I am a edtitor for the norwegian computer magazine called "HjemmePC"
Each month I am collecting good software to be included in our magazine. Sometimes we also ask about full version covermount, which means we are given an old full version of you program, with upgrade offer to the latest for our readers. I am excited to ask if this is something that could be of interest for you. You will off course be given editorial review and space in both our magazine and our software section on web. I hope to hear from you soon

Best Regards
Kent Kjernes
