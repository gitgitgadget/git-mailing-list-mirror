And how are things lining up for the upcoming one (January 2006, Dunedin, NZ)?

Workshops and BOFs don't need to be paper-backed at all. Though it's
not unlikely that someone with an interest in SCM theory would write a
paper covering git. I think the main interest would be to bring git
practical usage to the masses.

There's a lot of interest, but the barriers of entry are somewhat
high, with the codebase moving fast, and some of the concepts
requiring re-learning of what to expect from an SCM. Perhaps no so
much among kernel hackers, but the general populace is largely still
laden with cvs/svn and their mindset.
