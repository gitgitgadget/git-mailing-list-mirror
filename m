This looks good. I wondered if there were any tricks with passing the
resulting base to the delta-base cache. But I don't think so. We add to
the cache right _before_ the fallback check we're looking at here. And
the "base" variable does not persist to the next loop.

Arguably, one could do the fallback first and then add the result to the
delta base cache, but it probably isn't worth the trouble. However we
read the object via read_object() would hopefully have done so already.
