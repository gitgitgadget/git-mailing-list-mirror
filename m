Most (if not all) Git hackers are unpaid.

Err, I think we are all paid by someone, but that pay is to produce
things totally unrelated to Git.  Because if we weren't paid,
we probably couldn't afford fancy luxuries like food.  :)

Me, I hack on Git because I find it fun (it is a nice change of pace
from the dreary hacking I do for food) and I like using the software
to help me through my dreary hacking work.  But I'm certainly not
getting any money for my Git hacking.


Re: SoC, we should setup a page in the Git Wiki listing these great
ideas out - we are already up to a few, and subprojects has gotten
at least a couple of votes now as something the community would
like to see.
