FYI, I already have the exit status already in my prompt (the above
commands were just for the example). Still, the git behavior is
disturbing.

Moreover, this doesn't solve the issue when doing something like

  git log && some_other_command

No! I want to be warned about real SIGPIPEs.

I don't understand your question. If I invoke the pager myself,
I don't get a SIGPIPE:

cventin:~/software/gcc-trunk> git log
cventin:~/software/gcc-trunk[PIPE]> git log|m
cventin:~/software/gcc-trunk>
