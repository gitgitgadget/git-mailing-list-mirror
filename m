Thanks John, that looks pretty good!

In addition, I just discovered

   http://manned.org/git-remote-helpers/2b9e4c86

which contains git docs from Arch Linux, Debian, FreeBSD and Ubuntu packages. And since Arch tends to have the latest, so does manned.org. And best, it even lets me browser to older versions of a file.

So, taken together, I guess that solves my problem -- with John's link, I can see the bleeding edge versions, with manned.org the latest released version (as soon as Arch Linux catches up, which seems to be pretty quick :-).


Thanks!
