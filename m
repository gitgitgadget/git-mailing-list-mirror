Since it's "weekly" and this week is week number 49 in this year I have
a certain guess ;)
The blog has 2 entries only: That one and the wordpress welcome thingy...

Very nice indeed. Minor nitpick is comparing "hg add" to "git add" and
"hg commit" to "git commit -a", I'm discussing this with Scott already.
But very nice overall.

Cheers,
Michael

P.S.: For the record or in case anyone ?oogles this:

- compare "hg add" to "git add -N" and "hg commit" to "git commit -a",
which compares equivalent commands, or

- compare "hg add" to "git add" and "hg commit" to "git commit" (after
git add, but time "git commit" only), which compares similar sounding
commands; here, the sequence of commands is equivalent, just not the
individual ones
