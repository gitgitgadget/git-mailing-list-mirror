Probably not, I removed it.  I corrected my patch using all your other
comments and sent it again in another email.

Damn, time is always against me :-)
Hope it's gonna be included eventually!

Right, I saw that in July but it's not exactly the same feature
(arbitrary category in config vs repository path).  I think both are
useful independently.. If both get supported, there should be a way to
do it modularly to reuse code though.

Btw you can see a demo of my patch here: http://inso.cc/git

I kept it how it was but added a comment in the commitlog.

I think it's now better in v2, I added support for $from/$to also in
the categorized project list.

Thanks for your in depth comments, and I hope this patch will get
applied in the near future!
