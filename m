Hm, thanks, but the link was not helpful, there are no merge commits to 
master branch.

Those changes should have not been undone, that's how we caught it, 
because 1 line peace of code introduced new feature (+-10% tolerance on 
credit card verification  amount).

So most likeley they were undone, but our tree is pretty simple, we have 
master and production branches.
