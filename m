  Hi,

Dear diary, on Sat, Jul 22, 2006 at 05:55:59AM CEST, I got a letter
where Johannes Schindelin <Johannes.Schindelin@gmx.de> said that...

  ah well, I guess that's obscure enough to tell the user to directly
run git-init-db. ;-)

And the environment variable and the chgrp and g+s. That's my point.

I guess that's more common for the bare repositories.

git-cvsimport will create the repository for you, won't it?

Can't you just do make clean before git init? Or you can prepare
.gitignore before you check stuff in, so that the autogenerated files
don't pollute your git status output. ;-)
