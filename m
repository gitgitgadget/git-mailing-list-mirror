Some mailing list filters and/or spam filters flag mails with too many
recipients so that they need to pass through moderation first.  The
typical threads on this list are short and have few recipients while
longer threads, due to the list policy of adding every participants to
the Cc, will tend to have more recipients.

So there may a bias against long-running threads with multiple
participants with regard to timely delivery.

And frankly, if I were a list moderator and software asked me through
this sort of coincidence whether a mail should be delivered or not and a
glance at it shows nothing but insults, wild accusations, threats and so
on for the umpteenth time, I'd consider twice clicking "Accept".
Whether or not I ultimately did so, this would likely contribute to the
delay.
