Makes sense. This whole "rewrite the options as a heap-allocated list"
thing is pretty gross, but is probably the least-bad solution to the
problem. I wondered if there might be other unpaired diff_setup() /
diff_setup_done() calls. Curiously, there are more of the latter:

  $ git grep 'diff_setup(' | wc -l
  22

  $ git grep 'diff_setup_done(' | wc -l
  35

I think because repo_init_revisions() makes an implicit call to
diff_setup().

I suspect there are more elements of rev_info that could be allocated
(e.g., in a traversal without "--objects", I think trees and blobs are
left sitting in the pending array). It's a prime candidate for UNLEAK()
in most cases where we do a single traversal and then exit the program.
But for sub-functions like this, we perhaps should bite the bullet and
just make a rev_info_clear() function that can be used everywhere.

(I'm not opposed to your patch here in the meantime, though).
