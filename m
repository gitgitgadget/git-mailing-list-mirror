  um, wrong.

  ok, fine, let me explain why this command is a nightmarish
monstrosity. as i now understand, if i use an escaped wildcard
pattern, "git rm" will *automatically* (with no further guidance from
me, and no warning), operate recursively. so if, in the kernel source
tree, i ran:

  $ git rm \*.c

i would end up removing *all* 25,569 "*.c" files in the kernel source
repository.

  however, let's say i wanted to remove, recursively, all files with a
*precise* (non-globbed) name, such as "Makefile". so i, naively, run:

  $ git rm Makefile

guess what ... the lack of globbing means i remove only the single
Makefile at the top of the working directory.

  if that isn't an example of ridiculous, non-intuitive behaviour, i
don't know what is.
