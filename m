Subject: [PATCH] t: handle EOF in test_copy_bytes()
Message-ID: <20170716104532.zyni62mvzz6rglu6@sigill.intra.peff.net>

The test_copy_bytes() function claims to read up to N bytes,
or until it gets EOF. But we never handle EOF in our loop,
and a short input will cause perl to go into an infinite
loop of read() getting zero bytes.

I was playing with SANITIZE=undefined after Ren√©'s patches to see how
far we had left to go. I forgot to turn off sha1dc, which causes most
programs to die due to the unaligned loads. That means git-archive in
t5000 generates no output, triggering the bug. :)
