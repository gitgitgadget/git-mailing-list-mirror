Hereâ€™s my proposal for the updated manpage description of the option:

--no-filters::

Add the contents as is, ignoring any input filter that would have been
chosen by the attributes mechanism, including the end-of-line
conversion. Note that this option is not intended for interactive use,
since files added this way will always show up as modified if Git were
to apply transformations to them, making the situation potentially very
confusing.

And here the FAQ entry extended:

It is also possible for perpetually modified files to occur on any
platform if a smudge or clean filter is in use on your system but a file
was previously committed without running the smudge or clean filter.  To
fix this, run the following on an otherwise clean working tree:
+
----
$ git add --renormalize .
----
+
Another situation where perpetually modified may appear on any platform
is when a file has been committed without running any filters (including
the end-of-line conversion), but the `.gitattributes` file states that
this file requires a conversion.  In this case, you can either
renormalize the files if this happened by mistake, or modify
`.gitattributes` or `$GIT_DIR/info/attributes` as described above to
exempt the file from the conversion if this was intentional.

(I will send an updated patch set when we agree on the wording.)
