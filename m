Dear Invited Author,

Have you uploaded your invited paper for our conferences in Barcelona, Spain
7-9 April 2015? If not, kindly, upload now your INVITED paper via  www. inase. org until
March 20, 2015.

We have collaboration with 36 Journals, all with Impact Factor from ISI (Thomson Reuters)
and we can publish the extended version of your paper after the conference.
INASE Staff works very hard every day to establish these collaborations by extending the
list of our ISI/SCI/SCOPUS collaborating Journals.

Write INVITED-by-RENI-DIMITROVA in the Field of Short CV of the Web Form to condider your
paper as Invited Paper.

If you have participated in our INASE. org conferences in 2013, 2014, 2015 and your paper
has not been indexed in ISI and/or SCOPUS, contact me now to resolve the problem now. All
the papers of our previous conferences (in the conference version OR in their extended
version in Journals are now indexed in ISI/SCI and SCOPUS. Contact me.)

The Proceedings will be distributed to you in CD-ROM and Hard-Copy (10 volumes)
and will be indexed in SCOPUS , ISI, DBLP, Zentrablatt, ACM, ASM, IET, British library,
Scholar Google and all the other major indices.


Many Thanks

Reni Dimitrova
