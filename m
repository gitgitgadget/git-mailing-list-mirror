Generally "planets" just aggregate existing feeds, they don't provide servi=
ces=20
to create the feeds.  A feed URL is really just a URL to a RSS-formatted=20
resource.  (Most content management systems, e.g. Drupal or Joomla provide =
a=20
number of feed URL for [subsets of] the content; there are also free "weblo=
g"=20
services that also give you a feed URL.)  Hackergotchi is stupid slang for =
a=20
small image that can be placed beside your feed items, I'm not entirely sur=
e=20
what the etymology of it is.

If we wanted to, I suppose we could provide weblog services to developers. =
=20
Maybe on git-scm.com or something.  I'm just thinking out loud here, though=
=2E =20
I don't even know if there's real interest in something like that.  And=20
personally, I'd rather be writing patches than maintaining a Drupal=20
installation on devblog.git-scm.com or whatever.
