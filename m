As far as I can see those remaining instances are all to do with the '#' 
that separates a merge subject line from its parents. I don't think we 
need to complicate things anymore by respecting core.commentchar there 
as the '#' is not denoting a commented line, it is being used as an 
intra-line separator instead.

I agree that I don't see much point in respecting core.commentchar in 
the TODO file as unlike a commit message a legitimate non-commented line 
will never begin with '#'. Unfortunately I think we're committed to 
respecting it - see 180bad3d10f (rebase -i: respect core.commentchar, 
2013-02-11)

I think splitting the changes so that we have one patch that fixes the 
TODO file generation and another that fixes the commit message 
generation for fixup commands would be best.

Best Wishes
