I don't think there's a way to turn it off for `rev-list`. Merge-base
computations are more careful, so you could determine the correct
endpoints that way. But when you fed them to `rev-list`, it would hit
the same run of skewed commits.

We've discussed storing true generation numbers in the past, which would
make this optimization more robust, as well as allow us to speed up many
other traversals (e.g., the "tag --contains"). It's something I'd like
to revisit, but it's not at the top of the pile.

In the meantime, it would probably be possible to write a patch that
conditionally disables the optimization. But it would mean all of your
rev-lists run a _lot_ slower.
