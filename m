Yes, I don't think there is a way to make this race-proof without
somehow convincing "cat" to flush (and let us know when it has). Which
really implies killing the daemon, and wait()ing on cat to process the
EOF and exit.  And that makes the tests a lot more expensive if we have
to start the daemon for each snippet.

So I'm still fine with just dropping this test.

That doesn't really fix it, but just broadens the race window. I dunno.
Maybe that is enough in practice. We could do something like:

  repeat_with_timeout () {
	local i=0
	while test $i -lt 10
	do
		"$@" && return 0
		sleep 1
	done
	# no success even after 10 seconds
	return 1
  }

  repeat_with_timeout grep -i extended.attribute daemon.log

to make the pattern a bit more obvious (and make it easy to extend the
window arbitrarily; surely 10s is enough?).
