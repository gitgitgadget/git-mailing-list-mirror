Yes, this is a total tangent, but what happened to that one?  I did
not queue because I was led to expect v2 to follow soonish [*1*].

True.  I recall that years ago there was a discussion, but nobody
came up with patches, to do the consolidated .idx for exactly that
reason (not the "abbrev" reason).

Heh, 'fsck' intergration is not a 'feature' to sell anything, I
would think.  Nobody wants to run fsck for the sake of running
it---it is just having one extra file that must not go corrupt
_requires_ one to have a way to check its integrity and fsck is the
logical place to do so X-<.

In any case, we've had this for about a week in 'pu' after 4
iterations, and review comments seem to have quieted down [*2*], so
let's consider merging it down to 'next'.  I think at least I need
to "commit --amend" (or something like that) 16/23.

*2* That does not indicate either of these two:

    - nobody is interested in the topic
    - the topic is now without any flaw

    It only means that keeping it in 'pu' as a dormant topic would
    not do anybody any good.
