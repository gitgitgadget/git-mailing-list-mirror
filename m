Very nicely put.

My initial reaction was "Heh, I am not affiliated with that site.  Why is
this mail addressed to me?" and I was about to say something nasty back,
but reading your reply before I acted helped me avoid an embarrassment.

Thank you for always being a calm and reasoned participant in discussions
;-).

I was hoping that the planet thing to become a useful site when it was
announced, but it turns out that I actually have to agree with the
"useless" part of the subject.  I look for 'git' tag in delicious these
days instead.

I think part of the reason the planet failed was that whoever runs that
planet didn't do anything other than announcing it; it might have gained
momentum if he or she did some active recruiting to prime it well before
going online.
