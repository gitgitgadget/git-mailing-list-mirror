By the way, I think it is important that Git User's Survey 2010 lasts
past the holidays, i.e. into September or even October, even at the
cost of lasting two months, and not one month.

What do you think about this?

Well, one can say that 'age' doesn't tell us much either.

Sidenote: country of residence, besides giving a bit of demographical
information, it also gives us information about where we could organize
mini Git Together (beside the large one at Google, after GSoC Mentors
Summit).  It would be even better if Survs.com provided Google Map=20
gadget to mark point of residence... :-)

O.K., I agree that it is not that hard to analyze free-form in this cas=

All right.

Good idea!

This and the next question about _proposed_ features are IMHO hardest
to create well.

Well, I think there is rather heavy bias that if people are unhappy
with Git, they wouldn't be using it (well, unless they have to), and
they wouldn't be responding to this Git User's Survey (because they
didn't found it, for example).

O.K.

  + communication channels (incl. requesting help)

O.K.  I think that Git matured enough that improvements are not of the
kind that make usable out of unusable (or vice versa).

O'd remove this question, then.

Well, there is Junio's blog, there is GitHub blog, and there is
http://gitlog.wordpress.com/

Well, let's spam mailing lists in the name od "science"! ;-))))
