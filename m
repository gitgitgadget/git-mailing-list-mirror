This is called a hackathon, and I had the pleasure of attending three of 
them.  It is an extremely productive time, although you have to prepare to 
fall into a black hole after them, when all the fun suddenly stops.

As for dates: I am pretty free.  However, I kind of hoped to pre-/append 
it to the GSoC summit, since I cannot afford to pay the flight, but I 
could afford to pay the difference to wherever else than Mountain View the 
Gitogether would take place.

All this, of course, provided that Google invites us, and that I am 
actually one of the few lucky mentors being allowed to come.

Ciao,
Dscho
