OK, I think I understand it, and we are in agreement.  For the
purpose of the above paragraph, a side branch is what is not on the
"--ancestry-path", so all of the below "examples" are about the
behaviour when --ancestry-path is used.

This is exactly why I hinted that ancestry-path limiting may need to
come before path limiting decides which parents are interesting and
which are irrelevant, and I think it applies the same for the other
two examples.

I haven't thought through the implications of the definition of
"INTERESTING" you propose (without changing the rest of the code to
apply ancestry-path first, I assume).

While I'd like to see a solution that avoids to actually limit with
ancestry-path before limiting with pathspec (because I would imagine
that the most naive way to do so is to scan the graph twice, first
without pathspec to find and cull side branches from "ancestry-path"
point of view and then traverse the resulting graph again with
pathspec to further drop branches that did not contribute to the end
result), I am fairly sure that the end result we produce, whatever
its more efficient implementation would end up to be, _should_ be
equilvalent to the "cull with ancestry path first and then ignore
noncontributing branches with pathspec" semantics.

It is not immediately clear to me that your proposed implementation
will give us that semantics.  Oh, also, even though I said "I am
fairly sure" above, you may already have a counter-example that
shows why the semantics I think is right is not useful in some
cases.

I'll have to think about this a bit more, but it is unlikely I have
time to do so for the coming couple of days.  Sorry about that.
