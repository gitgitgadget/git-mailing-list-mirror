Yeah, I'd agree (though I do think there are some other issues with this
approach, at least in my tests).

If we do go this route, it might even be nice to use a small xmlto
wrapper that filters the stderr for us. Then the ci code doesn't have to
know about this distinction, and it prevents users from seeing the ugly
messages.
