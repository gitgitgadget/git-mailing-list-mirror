Ã†var makes a slight mention of this in their commit message:

    This approach of reusing the buffer does make the last user in
    pack-object.c's write_pack_file() slightly awkward, since we
    needlessly do a strbuf_setlen() before calling strbuf_release() for
    consistency. In subsequent changes we'll move that bitmap writing
    code around, so let's not skip the strbuf_setlen() now.

And this is to set us up for the final patch which moves the call to
rename_tmp_packfile_idx(&tmpname, &idx_tmp_name) after the closing brace
in the quoted portion of your message and the strbuf_release(). There,
we'll want the strbuf reset to the appropriate contents and length, and
not released.

But in the meantime it is awkward.

In each of these three, I wasn't able to decide if you wanted these
addressed in a newer version of this series, or if you were happy enough
with the result to pick it up. I'm happy to send you a new version, but
don't want to clog your inbox if you were already planning on picking
this up.

Thanks,
Taylor
