Hi,

Is gitweb maintainer planned to allow people to get from gitweb ? It
could be something good for ungited/remote people to get a tar for a
specific tree.
gd provide to create graphs and is often use in "web project" to
generate graphe. Could it here generated a graph of branches like in
gitk ?
It also could be cool to allow people to get binary files in an other
mimetype that text/plain.

Here are my wish :D it's worth what it's worth.
