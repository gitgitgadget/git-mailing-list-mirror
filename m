Conceptually this makes sense, although I have a comment below.

Out of curiosity, did this come up when looking into the cherry-pick
segfault/error from a few hours ago?

I wondered if pretend_sha1_file() makes a copy of the buffer, and indeed
it does. So this is correct.

But that raises an interesting question: how big are these objects, and
is it a good idea to store them in RAM? Obviously they're in RAM
already, but I'm not sure if it's one-at-a-time. We could be bumping the
peak RAM used if there's a large number of these entries. Touching the
on-disk odb does feel hacky, but it also means they behave like other
objects.

If it is a concern, I think it could be solved by "unpretending" after
our call to checkout_entry completes. That would need a new call in
sha1_file.c, but it should be easy to write.
