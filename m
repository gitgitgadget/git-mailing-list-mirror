The initial plan was to use Git's contrib/ subdirectory to get more of
the Git community involved in its development, and avoid making it a
personal toy.

Initially, Git-Mediawiki is both a personnal project and a student's
project (most of the code was written by students as part of an Ensimag
project under my supervision, with strong interaction with the Git
community).

It did work well in the first times of the project, there were very
fruitfull interactions between Git-Mediawiki and Git. Some issues raised
while developing Git-Mediawiki led to improvements in the remote-helper
mechanism in Git. Some code written for Git-Mediawiki ended up in Git
(the Perl layer for the credential helpers at least). I think this would
have been harder if Git-Mediawiki was a separte project.

However, the rest of the plan did not work that well. I thought having
the code in contrib/ would help keeping the project alive if I became
inactive. It's been a while I didn't have enough time-budget to work on
the project, and the git.git review mechanism has actually blocked a lot
of contributors. Patches get posted here and there but no one takes time
for a proper submission here, and when this happens contributors give up
after the first round of review instead of re-rolling.

So, my conclusion is that a simpler submission mechanism (GitHub's
pull-requests) and a less picky code review would help Git-Mediawiki.

From previous discussions, I think Junio will agree with that: he's
reluctant to keeping too much stuff in contrib/ and usally prefers
external projects.

FYI, I'm no longer using Mediawiki as much as I did, and I don't really
use Git-Mediawiki anymore.

The main blocking point to revive Git-Mediawiki is to find a new
maintainer (https://github.com/Git-Mediawiki/Git-Mediawiki/issues/33). I
believe I just found one ;-).

Note that being a separate project doesn't mean there can't be any
interaction with this list. Requests for reviews for separate projects
are usually welcome even though they don't happen often here.

There's also a hybrid solution used by git-multimail: have a copy of the
code in git.git, but do the development separately. I'm not sure it'd be
a good idea for Git-Mediawiki, but I'm mentionning it for completeness.
