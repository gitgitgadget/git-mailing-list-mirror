Hi folks,

I've been using the latest Cogito. When I seek back and forth in a git repo,
directories I've created tend to persist backward in time, cluttering up
earlier versions.

By the discussions on this list, I'm pretty sure there's a way to stop this,
but I don't know clearly what it is, and I'm worried about trying things
that might corrupt my repository. Could someone spell it out for me please?

Be well,
Zack
