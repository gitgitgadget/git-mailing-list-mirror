Hi All 
Im very new to GIT Stuff. But by installing the latest version<git-1.3.3
> of GIT and going thru the tutorial, I am unable to understand why
there is a mismatch in the commmands.
Tutorial says use commands like git init-db but actually these are
installed as git-init-db. Is this OK.. or NOT.

One more doubt is .. I was unable to locate a command like git-add ..

Can some one help me.
