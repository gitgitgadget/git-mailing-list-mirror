In case there was any confusion, this is why we almost never bother
posting to the list, because no matter what the topic, it always turns
into why the git community hates GitHub.

I really don't understand the disdain for a company that's made git
accessible to a much wider audience in less than a year. I kinda
thought we'd all be on the same team.

For the record, Scott wasn't a GitHub employee when he wrote
git-scm.com, nor was he paid to produce it. Turns out people don't
always have ulterior motives, he just wanted to make a better git
homepage.
