I have a co-worker who has suggested that, using "svnadmin hotcopy", subversion 
can be
    just as "distributed" a system as Git

While I see how this can be done, it hardly seems to me to qualify as "just as", 
making this "plausible" at best.

Can anyone give me a quick confirmation of this?  Confirmed? Plausible? Busted?

If this is confirmed or plausible, could someone give me a quick run-down?

(I would appreciate a response, no matter how long it takes, but I do have a 
meeting with this co-worker in another 16 hours... (10am Pacific).)

Thanks in advance!

(FYI - I have cross-posted this, just once, to an SVN forum, in the event they 
might have a different opinion.)
