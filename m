Makes sense.

The source is pretty ugly to read both before and after, though. I
wonder if using a literal like `5*10^5` would be even nicer. That makes
the source pretty readable, and the output would put it in <tt> or
similar. Which maybe is a little funny, but kind of makes sense to me
typographically as a kind of "this is math" style.
