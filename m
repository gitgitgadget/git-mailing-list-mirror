Could what you're describing be prototyped as a post-checkout hook that
looks at the reflog? It sounds to me like it could, but perhaps I've
missed some subtlety.

Not re-writing out a file that hasn't changed is one thing, but I think
for more complex behaviors (such as the "I want everything to have the
same mtime" mentioned in another thread on-list), and this, it makes
sense to provide some hook mechanism than have git itself do all the
work.

I also don't see how what you're describing could be generalized, or
even be made to work reliably in the case you're describing. If the
engineer runs "make" on this branch he's testing out that might produce
an object file that'll get used as-is once he switches back, since
you've set the mtime in the past for that file because you re-checked it
out.
