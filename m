Hi Michael,

Thank you for submitting a patch! However, please make sure you read
SubmittingPatches carefully. Your message should consist of the regular
mail headers (as generated by git-format-patch + whatever else you want
to add), the commit message, a line containing "---", and then the diff.
Any cover letter material should go after the "---".

IOW, the format the git-format-patch generates is actually a mail in the
correct format. If you can convince your mailer to use that as a
template for sending a mail, that is the best bet.

I know these seem like little things, but they make the life of the
maintainer much easier, as it means your patch and commit message can be
applied directly by the git tools.
