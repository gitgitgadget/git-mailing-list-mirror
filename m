Oh, that's clever.  Alas it's not applicable to our tests, because
'yes' is not portable; 8648732e29 (t/test-lib.sh: provide a shell
implementation of the 'yes' utility, 2009-08-28).

Ugh.  I think this would work reliably, but...  ugh :)

I wonder whether we could do this as a new pair of 'test-tool'
helpers, one to run the pager through the usual pager-invoking
machinery and to generate a lot of output, the other to be used as the
early-exiting pager, with a pipe between the two to ensure that the
SIGPIPE does happen.  Well, essentially the same that you outlined
above but in C instead of shell, which I somehow find less "ugh".
