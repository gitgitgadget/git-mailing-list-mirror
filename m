Heh. I'm surprised it's that big a difference, as processing simple
printf strings should be pretty quick. I guess what happens in your
program is that your strings almost always require a re-allocation
(because you've just released, and we start small), and we literally end
up doing a partial copy via vsnprintf(), realizing we're out of space,
reallocating, and then running it again.

So it's noticeably worse when we _do_ reallocate, but usually that
should be amortized across many calls (and if it isn't, then you are
paying the much bigger price of lots of mallocs, and you should optimize
that first :) ).

That being said, it doesn't seem like it would be _worse_ to move from
addf to multiple addstrs.
