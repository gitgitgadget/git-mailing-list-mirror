I seem to remember somebody who started out reimplementing Unix, and
badly, at that.  With the help of many other people, this thing
finally became portable to more than i386 and more than AT drives.
Took quite a long time.  The ancient floppy disk code still has the
renown of being one of the worst pieces of drivers all around.

If you find this silly, so do I.  That's the point.

Cooperation is easier if one is of the opinion rather that disrespect
has to be earned: otherwise you alienate potential contributors before
they even had a chance to contribute.

This difference in approach is one of the things I can't help admiring
in Junio.  And I don't think it is to the detriment of git.
