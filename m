Isn't \(.*\) a bit too loose for grabbing $grp? What if someone some
day adds another column to express some other sort of attribute? (Or,
if someone perhaps uses the "deprecated" attribute but places it in
column 3 rather than 2 as documented.) It probably would be better to
tighten this up by grabbing only non-whitespace characters, as is
already done for $cmd.

(In fact, this sed invocation is already broken for "deprecated",
isn't it? According to the command-list.txt header comments,
"deprecated" should be placed before "common", yet the sed invocation
expects "common" to follow the command immediately. Perhaps a
preparatory patch could fix this issue; or just do away with
"deprecated" entirely since it's not used.)

Since both $cmd and $grp are simple tokens, neither of which contain
whitespace, this could be handled more simply by just having sed emit
them separated by a space rather than by ':'; in which case your
'while read' loop wouldn't need to muck with IFS at all.
