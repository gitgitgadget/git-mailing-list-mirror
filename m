I agree; I think this might have been in part because the Wiki was so
easy to use and change; I did receive some patches, but not any
overwhelming amount.

The question is, however,is whether to make the _current_ overview link
target simply alias at the new site _now_, though. :-) It seems to be
a waste to maintain two websites in parallel, as well as actively harmful
and confusing for people interested in Git, as I tried to explain in
my other mail. That's why this subthread was born.

Thanks, I appreciate this, though pretty much all of this sort of popped
up simply because I had root access to a bored server. ;-) Especially
wrt. the wiki, I think it's mainly Jakub Narebski who is keeping it
together content-wise and keeps bugging me if it falls apart
technically.
