Thanks both for an interesting discussion. Junio left a remark about
"[easy to read] especially if it is reflowed" which I recognized from my
own thinking yesterday. Then I went for fewer lines in what arguably
looks a bit crammed. Since I was not the only one to find readability in
the larger number of lines, here it is as v2.

Junio, if you go "meh, what I've already picked up will do just as
fine", feel free to act on that, i.e., to not act on this v2.

I very briefly thought about such an approach here, but still in the
callback handler, where the allocation would be quite a bit more
awkward, since we'd do it over and over.

Something I considered a bit more seriously was a helper that takes
three strings ("branch", branch and "mergeoptions") and does the check.
But as you mention in this thread, it's a bit special that we're looking
for a specific subsection (that is not a compile-time constant). So it
felt like the kind of "nice-to-have" helper that you'd end up using just
once or twice. (That said, I didn't look to see if I could find other
instances.)

Instead of using `starts_with()`, the magic number 7, `strlen()` and a
fair number of additions to verify the three parts of the config key
"branch.<branch>.mergeoptions", use `skip_prefix()` to jump through them
more explicitly.

We need to introduce a new variable for this (we certainly can't modify
`k` just because we see "branch."!). With `skip_prefix()` we often use
quite bland names like `p` or `str`. Let's do the same. If and when this
function needs to do more prefix-skipping, we'll have a generic variable
ready for this.
