Oops. Yes, though I expanded it to:

  * After initializing, note that key/val will not yet point to any trailer.
  * Call advance() to parse the first one (if any).

Obviously another convention would be:

  for (trailer_iterator_init(&iter, msg);
       !trailer_iterator_done();
       trailer_iterator_advance()) {
  }

but I don't think it matters much either way as long as it's clearly
documented.
