That's not the primary goal. The primary goal is to keep untranslated,
and immutable messages in plumbing commands. We may decide one day that
_("gone") is not the best message for the end user and replace it with,
say, _("vanished"), but the "gone" has to remain the same forever and
regardless of the user's config for scripts using it.

We could have written

  in_porcelain ? _("gone") : "gone"

here and there in the code, but having a single place where we set all
the messages seems simpler. Call setup_ref_filter_porcelain_msg() and
get the porcelain messages, don't call it and keep the plumbing
messages.

Note that it's not the first place in the code where we do this, see
setup_unpack_trees_porcelain in unpack-trees.c for another instance.

Karthik: the commit message could be improved, for example:

Introduce setup_ref_filter_porcelain_msg() so that the messages used in
the atom %(upstream:track) can be translated if needed. By default, keep
the messages untranslated, which is the right behavior for plumbing
commands. This is needed as we port branch.c to use ref-filter's
printing API's.

Why not a comment right below "} msgs = {" saying e.g.:

	/* Untranslated plumbing messages: */

I think we do need duplication for the reason above.
