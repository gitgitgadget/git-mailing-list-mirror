Yeah, I think my gut feeling matches yours.

The other downside I can think of is that you can't just run "git repack
--geometric" every time, and eventually get a good result (or one that
asymptotically approaches good ;) ). I.e., you now have two types of
repacks: quick and dirty rollups, and "real" ones that do reachability.
So you need some heuristics about how often you do one versus the other.

I'm definitely OK with that outcome. And I think we could even bake
those heuristics into a script or mode of repack (e.g., maybe "gc
--auto" would trigger a bigger repack every N times or something). But
that's what I came up with by brainstorming. :)
