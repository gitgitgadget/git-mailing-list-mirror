Since you asked...

=46rom the first time I saw gitweb the feature I wanted was to put
more useful information in the path of the URL rather than in the
query string.

One possible organization might be:

/<project>/<commitish>/<path>[/<more_path> ...]

I'd really like to be able to publish nice clean URLs (without any
query component) for getting at particular branches within projects,
for example.

The above might not be entirely feasible in the face of hierachical
project names containing '/' characters as they might then conflict
with branch names.

Another general feature I'd like is for URLs to be as interchangeable
as possible between gitweb and command-line git tools. My goal is to
be able to push out a new branch and then send an email announcing the
branch with a single URL something like:

	http://git.somewhere.org/project/branch

where this would obviously work if fed to a web browser, but ideally
would also be possible to feed to git-fetch or even git-clone perhaps
without requiring any user knowledge on how to mangle it first.
