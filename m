If asked a couple weeks ago I would have suggested layeredtech, but I'd tend
to discourage it now as I ran into a succession of issues that they took too
many time to fix (ip addresses not routed to my box, almost 72h of downtime)

Actually, if you aren't running a very critical service that you rely on, it
is a pretty good service. It's just that when they fuck up, they fuck up big
time :)
