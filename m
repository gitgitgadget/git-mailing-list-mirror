Thanks for this summary.

Just for the record, as the person who suggested that we should respect
repo config here, I don't personally care all that much either way. I do
not plan to use the feature myself, but it was just what I would have
expected to happen. So I can live with it either way.

That said, it seems like if we were to go back to caching, we'd need to
handle directory changes in order for aliases (which already do respect
repo config) to be correct anyway. So it doesn't seem like this is
introducing any burden that was not there already.
