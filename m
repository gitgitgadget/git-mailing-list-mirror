Hi Micha=C5=82,

you probably would have received a more timely response if you

1. had avoided top-posting, and
2. had kicked into action yourself rather than feeling somebody else
   should solve your problem.

You are welcome, not only for the information, of course, but also for the
bug fixes. Would be nice to thank hard-working people like Peff for that,
every once in a while.

The first time I read this paragraph, I closed the mail right then and
there. And I normally would not have looked at it again.

You see, the code running git-scm.com is Open Source, which means that you
can fix it just as well as everybody else. Of course it takes a bit more
effort than to tell other people what you think they should do, yet taking
action would have been the appropriate thing to do. Admittedly I find that
sense of entitlement that I read in the above-quoted paragraph quite
appalling.

So why did I open this mail again, then? Easy: I did not notice any other
report of the same issue, and the problem was shared by one of my
colleagues, so I went ahead and fixed it (note that I am probably even
less of a Ruby/Rake expert than you are, yet the documentation how to
develop this beast locally is so good that even I was able to develop and
test the fix):

=09https://github.com/git/git-scm.com/pull/741

I guess this is your lucky day ;-)

Ciao,
Johannes
