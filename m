This might surprise you, but everything in the world is not a unix
command line. Using tools designed for use on a unix command line in a
highly interactive environment like Eclipse would produce an
abominably clunky result.

Presumably you think this is the Unix way.

I have already explained all the pragmatic reasons for doing a GIT
implementation in Java but you are prepared to ignore all of those
reasons. You have ignored all these reasons rather than lift a finger
to compose a well-reasoned rebuttal.

Instead you cling to a dogmatic insistence that GIT respositories only
be accessed via the C toolsets.

David, you are being extremely childish and extremely dogmatic. Why bother?
