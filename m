Yeah, I'd prefer not to go to mkpath(), even though that's the simplest
thing, just because we should be reducing the subtle non-reentrant parts
of the code over time. I don't think the cleanup handling for
mkpathdup() is too bad:

 	return error_errno(_("unable to write file '%s' mode %o"),

It even gets a little easier if you hoist it to a strbuf outside the
loop, as you don't need to free on each loop iteration. That seems worth
it to me to get rid of a function that IMHO is mis-designed (it is
really only useful if you assume paths are bounded by PATH_MAX, which we
know isn't always true).

Sure, but I think any solution here is going to look strange. Keep in
mind that we're trying to improve the case where we print _nothing_
useful at all. If you do see this on a non-fatal message, the subsequent
messages may be informative. E.g.:

  error: could not format error: unable to open loose object %s
  fatal: bad object HEAD~12

is probably better than just exiting after the first.

Well, let us know if you do. ;)
