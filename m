Hey Richard,

Using your test case, I still get the error (which is, specifically an
error dialog saying:

   Failed to stage selected line.

   error: patch failed: glacierupload.sh:55
   error:glacierupload.sh: patch does not apply

Note that I'm highlighting the change in the source code, then
right-clicking it and selecting "Stage lines for commit." ("Stage hunk for
commit" also results in the error.)

If I stage the entire file by clicking on it in the upper-lefthand pane,
things work fine.

This is a Gentoo box, so I wonder I happened to build Tcl without the
appropriate unicode support (that one would find in most package-based
distros)?

In briefly digging a bit more, it would seem that git gui is foisting the
work onto "git apply" to create a patch and stage it? (If I'm reading the
source correctly, It looks like the error dialog title is from
https://github.com/prati0100/git-gui/blob/master/lib/diff.tcl#L700

and then the error strings that populate the dialog are bubbled up from git
apply.

Any ideas on what would make "git apply" potentially choke? I wonder if it
has to do with a mixed file encoding?

I tried setting both:

core.checkRoundTripEncoding true 
gui.encoding utf-8

on that repo; git gui still errored out in the same way. 

I also tried changing gui.encoding to utf-16; no dice...

To reiterate, git add -i worked fine...

best,
preed
