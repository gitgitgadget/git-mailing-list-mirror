Matt,
Thanks for picking this up and the approach to working around the
updated build approach of recent Visual Studio versions.
Â 
It looks good to me, but the CI should also be tweaked (see below) so
that it is tested.

There is one 'gotcha' in the yml (probably historical) in that it
doesn't actually test the approach/changes that Matt addresses regarding
my [1].

That is, I'm looking at the 'out of the box' view, while the yml test
_preloads_ the vcpkg artefacts.

There is also the (on Windows) issue that the ARM support has recently
been developed which also fudges the CmakeLists.txt file but forgot
about the assumption in the vcpkg install batch file that the default is
the x86 setup.

I'd agree that there's no need to augment the CI job to expressly check
the other flags, but the existing test should reflect the intent of the
patches (i.e. no preloading of the vcpkg artefacts).

I haven't had much time to catch up on Git, and I'm off-line again from
Sat night for another week.
