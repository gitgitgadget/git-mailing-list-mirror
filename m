I allowed myself to quibble much more than usually as I think it
serves a good technical purpose. I am a new git user but quite
pervasive in getting all the info I can (I have bound copy of all git
man pages and about ten tutorials, diligently devoting much of my time
last month to reading it all; generally I am not scared by strange
things like plain Tex, FORTH, Prolog etc.) so I might serve as a good
example of user who tried hard and still did not get it with current
docs.

But it is a thin border, so please do not hesitate to shut me up if my
judgement of technical merit is wrong.

I would appreciate this update ;-)
