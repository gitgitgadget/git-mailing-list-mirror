I stole the use of "int" from your code. ;)

More seriously, though, I wondered if callers might have sign issues
assigning from a "signed char". Usually we hold object ids in an
"unsigned char", but what happens if I do:

  signed char foo[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4 };
  odb_load_loose_cache(foo[0]);

when the parameter is "unsigned"?

I'll admit I get lost in all of the integer promotion rules there, but
are we sure there's no way we can end up with a funky truncation?

If the answer is no, then I agree that your suggestion is a strict
improvement.

Yeah, I know that one could be a dangerous truncation.

I also considered just taking an object_id, which would make the
function "load the cache such that this oid would be valid". And it's
not necessarily the caller's business how much we load.

But that's OK for OBJECT_INFO_QUICK, but it's pretty darn subtle for the
abbrev code. That code doesn't care about just one object, but wants all
objects that share its prefix. That works now because we know that the
prefix is always at least 2 hex chars, so it's OK to load just that
subset.

Good suggestion.

Oops, thanks. I toyed with making the strbuf here static, which is why I
dropped the release. But since we only use it on a cache miss, I decided
it was better to avoid the hidden global (and then of course forgot to
re-add the release).
