I'll be arriving around 11 am on the 8th, if anyone wants to record
something for the GitMinutes podcast [1]. Send me an email directly,
or just walk up to me at the conference and say hi! I'll hopefully be
hanging around the contributor's summit area with some microphones,
but I've been unable to get any feedback from GitHub about whether
this is OK, so.. I guess we'll just wing it when I get there.
