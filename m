This message isn't generated by git itself, but rather by a pre-commit
hook. You can skip the hook by running "git commit --no-verify".

As for the false positive in the hook logic, I can't say more without
having seen the hook source. :) Do you know where you got it from?

(Googling for "suspicious patch lines" turns up some hits, but with
varying provenance).
