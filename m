And create a bunch of new ones. I think you mean "buy yourself a new=20
laptop"!

Just because YOUR computer is modern and is happy being fed a new bigge=
r=20
hard drive doesn't mean they all are. This computer here has 3/4gig ram=
=2E=20
Tiny by modern standards but I can't put any more in - it only has thre=
e=20
slots at 256Mb maximum each. And it's got a 250Gb drive but it can only=
=20
use the first 128Gb (I'm being economical with the truth here, but=20
hey...)

Anyways. Why should hundreds of people have to throw out thousands of=20
serviceable machines just because a few programmers can't be assed to a=
t=20
least TRY to be economical with their usage of resources?

Cheers,
