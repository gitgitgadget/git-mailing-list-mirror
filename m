I wanted to avoid that. I feel that "Result" is too general. I had thought 
about using the 'ed' rather than 'ion' word endings, but that would require 
(to my mind) the noun e.g. "Expanded arguments" and " Selected commits" 
(still could be - see below), while the 'ion' endings felt complete. The 
Result is what is shown in thable below these headings ;-)

All the conversions appear to work. I think that asciidoc is viewing these a 
blocked text without any expansion. Plus, it would be horrendous trying to 
check the formatting (endless reruns of make.. ... .. )

This was the whole point. For some (e.g. me) the explanations had fallen 
flat on their face, and it was difficult to see what it was on about. Now I 
know, it's all obvious, but what was needed was a carefully stepped through 
example or two. If the dear reader can't see the big steps, let's give them 
small steps.

Jacob had given an 'example' in response to my early query, but it just felt 
like repetion of what had already been said, but it didn't take the next 
[small] step, which this example does (partly because it can as it can use 
the Loeliger diagram, which wasn't available in Jacob's example).

I also deliberately added the B^@ and B^! (standalone) example as the C^@ 
and C^!  didn't have an 'all parents' (plurals!), but it did have the 
indentation issue - see above about stretching out the headers, which would 
give more space for the indentations.

I hadn't viewed it that way. It would be an extra step.

As noted it was about squeezing that one in. I'll look at alternate heading 
titles and spacing options.
