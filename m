The diminished value is:

  1. This is a situation that doesn't actually happen in real life.

  2. Now we're carrying extra code inside git only for the sake of
     testing (which can have its own bugs, etc).

Still, it may be better than nothing.

Right, so this is sort of what I meant in (2). Now we have a
tar.ustarsizemax setting shipped in git that is totally broken if you
set it to "1".

I can live with it as a tradeoff, but it is definitely a negative IMHO.
