Less is obviously used across the board (git log, git help, etc.). The assumption of the same starting point for all situations is not valid. For example: my own environment runs git from the following starting points (in order of frequency):
1. Cygwin (bash, yay, easy).
2. OSS (Posix-like, bash, easy).
3. Jenkins (dumb terminal, no colours or else the output gets messed up).
4. GUARDIAN (Not at all Posix-like, I have to supply my own environment variables and the terminal emulator is not vt220 compatible).
5. USS (Posix-like, bash, easy).
6. TSO/ISPF (Not at all Posix-like, I have to supply my own environment variables and the terminal emulator is not vt220 compatible).

In the case of 2-4, this all happens on the same system. Same with 3,5,6. So I have to maintain multiple "less" profiles to maintain output sanity. I cannot do this using .bashrc or .profile because those do not apply. If I had to suffer a single definition set within git, I would lose my mind.

Admittedly, I am in a highly complex situation, but it is a real one (ok, two because of a diverged path between NonStop and MVS) and there are hundreds in a similar situation.
