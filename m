This is sort of a side note, but I'm curious why you need 10k remotes.

We used to do this at GitHub as part of our fork storage (the shared
repository had each fork as a remote). We fixed the quadratic issues
like d0da003d5 (use a hashmap to make remotes faster, 2014-07-29). But
even the linear work to read the config is noticeable (and hits you on
every command, even ones that don't care about remotes).  Now instead we
pass the refspecs directly to fetch whenever move objects between the
storage repos. They were the same for every remote anyway (and I'd guess
that is true, too, of your 10k remotes).
