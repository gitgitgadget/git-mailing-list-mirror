Yup, that was one sentence in about 5 pages of bile.  In contrast,
Junio gave a good overview of the technical areas involved here, and
estimates about what to do there best.

That's a constructive way to encite somebody to delve into the task
and try to see whether he can come up with something.

But 5 pages of what amounts to "you are an idiot, come up with a
patch" is not leading anywhere.

No, you are _defending_ why the work has not been done.  This
rationalizing around the bush is a waste of time.  You probably have
spent quite more time with your venting than Junio did with his
technical analysis, and the latter has been much more helpful.

So why waste all that time and adrenaline on something where you have
already said all you consider relevant?  The arguments don't get any
stronger by shouting, and it is not like you are inconvenienced in any
manner if somebody takes a look at the matter.
