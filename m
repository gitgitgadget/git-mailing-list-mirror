Hello!

Glad to hear from you. :)

So I actually tried install-wiki.sh, and it "failed to start lighttpd"
and told me to see logs. I couldn't find them and stopped there...

It would be great to hook this up into CI somewhere, but I suspect it
isn't considering how it doesn't actually work out of the box.

I'm hoping we can still do things and fix some things without going
through that trouble, but I recognize it would be better to have unit
tests operational.

Honestly, I would prefer just having this thing work and not have to
work on it. :) I have lots of things on my plate and I'm just scratching
an itch on this one - some backup script broke and I am trying to fix
it. Once it works, my work is done, so unfortunately I cannot lead that
project (but I'd be happy to help when I can of course).
