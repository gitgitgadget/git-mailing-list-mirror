    9308b7f3ca read_packed_refs(): die if `packed-refs` contains bogus data, 2017-07-01

we silently ignored pretty much any bogus data in a `packed-refs`
file. I think that was pretty clearly a bad policy. The above commit
made parsing quite a bit stricter, calling `die()` if it found any
lines that it didn't understand.

But there's one situation that is maybe not quite so clear-cut. The
first line of a `packed-refs` file can be a header that enumerates
some traits of the file containing it; for example,

    # pack-refs with: peeled fully-peeled 

The old code would have tolerated lots of breakage in that line. For
example, any of the following headers would have just been ignored:

    # arbitrary data that looks like a comment
    # pack-refs with peeled fully-peeled          ‚Üê note: missing colon
    # pack-refs

Now, any of the above lines are considered errors and cause git to
die.

In my opinion, that is a good thing and we *shouldn't* tolerate broken
header lines; i.e., the status quo is good and we *shouldn't* apply
this patch.

But there might be some tools out in the wild that have been writing
broken headers. In that case, users who upgrade Git might suddenly
find that they can't read repositories that they could read before. In
fact, a tool that we wrote and use internally at GitHub was doing
exactly that, which is how we discovered this "problem".

This patch shows what it would look like to relax the parsing again,
albeit *only* for the first line of the file, and *only* for lines
that start with '#'.

The problem with this patch is that it would make it harder for people
who implement broken tools in the future to discover their mistakes.
The only result of the error would be that it is slower to work with
the `packed-refs` files that they wrote. Such an error could go
undiscovered for a long time.

The tighter check was released quite a while ago, and AFAIK we haven't
had any bug reports from people tripped up by this consistency check.
So I'm inclined to believe that the existing tools are OK and this
patch would be counterproductive. But I wanted to share it with the
list anyway.
