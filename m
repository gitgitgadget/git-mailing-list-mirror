Okay, I'll give in, then.

Okay. Then I follow the advice of the large and angry Saucer Crunching

Yes, there is. Although git itself is an example that there are two 
"greater than almost anything else in the graph" nodes.

Also, let's not be overzealous with our math degrees, okay? :-)

I do not mind changing the description if the consensus is to keep 
git-resolve-script.

The little blue penguin says: Thanks for all the fish!
