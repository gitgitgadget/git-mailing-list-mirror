I came here to say that. ;)

I do not mind using pushv() directly, or a pushvec() that is a
convenience wrapper for pushv(). Even better if that wrapper is smart
enough to pre-allocate based on items->nr, as you mentioned, but that
can also come later.

One thing that did surprise me: the use of "int" here for iterating,
rather than size_t. But it seems that strvec is already storing ints,
which is an accident!

I think we'd want the patch below. It can be applied independently
(though if we do take the index-iterating version of Ã†var's patch, I
think it should switch to size_t).

Subject: [PATCH] strvec: use size_t to store nr and alloc

We converted argv_array (which later became strvec) to use size_t in
819f0e76b1 (argv-array: use size_t for count and alloc, 2020-07-28) in
order to avoid the possibility of integer overflow. But later, commit
d70a9eb611 (strvec: rename struct fields, 2020-07-28) accidentally
converted these back to ints!

Those two commits were part of the same patch series. I'm pretty sure
what happened is that they were originally written in the opposite order
and then cleaned up and re-ordered during an interactive rebase. And
when resolving the inevitable conflict, I mistakenly took the "rename"
patch completely, accidentally dropping the type change.

We can correct it now; better late than never.
