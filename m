The jgit team, rocks! You guys are  simply awesome in your 
responsiveness. Thanks for a great project.

Please let me know if I can help with any maven related issues. Here is 
a couple of
links I use to evangelize use of maven in OS projects:

Why Maven Rocks:
<http://farrukhnajmi.blogspot.com/2008/02/why-maven-rocks-in-beginning-there-was.html>

Why Maven - Wiki Page:
<http://ebxmlrr.wiki.sourceforge.net/whymaven>

Here are the main resources I use as reference for maven:

Maven Official Docs:
<http://maven.apache.org/guides/index.html>

Better Builds With Maven:
<http://www.topazproject.org/trac/attachment/wiki/MavenInfo/BetterBuildsWithMaven.pdf?format=raw>

I think it is great that the project supports maven at least partially 
today.
I would suggest the project consider maven for all its 
build/configuration management at some point in future.
It takes a little learning curve initially (most for dev team members 
not users) but pays off handsomely very quickly.
