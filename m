Correct. It significantly predates any support for asciidoctor in our
Makefile, and needs to do some custom ruby-level tweaking (though
possibly that could be cleaned up these days).

The doc_importer script you found, though, is not part of that process.
I _think_ it's just leftover cruft. The actual import and conversion
happens as part of the rake task in:

  https://github.com/git/git-scm.com/blob/master/lib/tasks/index.rake

(Not that any of this matters for your series; just sprinkling some fun
facts into the conversation).
