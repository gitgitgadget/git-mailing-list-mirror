Dear Friend,

FOR HUMAN WELFARE) California, U.S.A. We are organizing a global youths
combined conferences taking place from August 14th-16th 2006 at
California in the United States and in ,Dakar Senegal from August
21th-23th 2006 .In our request to invite people from various countries
around the world, I went in search of e-mails on the web site as a 
means of contacting youths and organizations .

*As a result, I picked your e-mail from an N.G.O`s website. If you are interested 
to participate and want to represent your country, you may contact the secretariat 
of the organizing committee for details and information. You should also 
inform them that you were invited to participate by a friend of yours (Violet Tesyi), who is a member of the American Youths 4 Peace and a staff of(WORLD YOUTH ORGANIZATION FOR HUMAN WELFARE). 

I believe that we may have the opportunity to meet if you may be willing to participate 
in this event. You can also inform youths & NGOs in your country about
these conferences. 

The benevolent donors of the Organizing Committee will provide round trip air tickets and accommodation for the period of participants? stay in the U.S., to all registered participants. If you are a holder of passport that may require visa to enter the United States you may inform the conference secretariat at the time of registration, as the organizing committee is responsible for all visa arrangements and travel assistances.
