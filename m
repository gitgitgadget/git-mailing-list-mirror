Thanks, I missed that one. So just adding a feature to clean up commit
marks wouldn't be sufficient to cover that case.

I've seen repos which have tens of thousands of tags. Something like
"rev-list --all" would have tens of thousands of pending objects.
I think in practice it's limited to the number of objects (though in
practice more like the number of commits).

I'd note also that for most uses we don't need a full object_array. You
really just need a pointer to the "struct object" to wipe its flags.

So there we might waste 8 bytes per object in the worst case. But bear
in mind that the process is wasting a lot more than that per "struct
commit" that we're holding. And versus the existing scheme, it's only
for the moment until prepare_revision_walk() frees the old pending list.

I assume it was mostly to clean up after itself, since there's no
explicit "I'm done with the traversal" function. But as I said earlier,
I'd be surprised of a revision walk doesn't leave some allocated cruft
in rev_info these days (e.g., pathspec cruft). In practice it doesn't
matter much because we don't do arbitrary numbers of traversals in
single process.
