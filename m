Yeah, everything you've described is consistent with the problem being
fixed there. Good news, then: the patch is already in Git's "master"
branch, and will be part of the next release (which should be v2.33.0).

If you can reproduce the problem at will and building from master isn't
too hard, it would be nice to know if that indeed fixes it for you.
