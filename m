This is the same issue discussed in this sub-thread:

  https://lore.kernel.org/git/20190828153944.GA29715@sigill.intra.peff.net/

It's not macOS-specific, but for whatever reason it's much easier to
trigger there. There's a reliable reproduction with a sleep() in:

  https://lore.kernel.org/git/20190829220630.GH8571@szeder.dev/

The solution is something like the "after a write() error, pump the read
channel to see if we got an ERR packet" patch GÃ¡bor showed in the reply
to that message.

But an interesting thing to note: this particular race only happens with
protocol v0 (and the test is forcing v0, because v2 would not produce a
"not our ref" error in the first place). In general I'd suspect that v2
is a bit less susceptible to these types of races, because it has more
of a request/response flow. But it's still possible (e.g., if the server
side ever aborts before reading the whole request).

For this _particular_ test, since we know that it is testing a v0-only
behavior, we might want to just loosen the test. This goes against the
point of adding it in 014ade7484 (upload-pack: send ERR packet for
non-tip objects, 2019-04-13), but it's the best we can do for now.
Something like this:
