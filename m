Oh, right. I thought "-f" would cause it to exit 0 even if some items
failed to be removed, but that only applies to ENOENT. So I think that
is probably a good change. I agree it's not a true error, but just a
sign of something fishy, but I don't think it hurts to have extra lint
checks.

Replacing it the "exit 1" with a "die" that has a message is probably a
good idea, though.
