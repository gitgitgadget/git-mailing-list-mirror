I understood that.  However, I simply do not have the time to take care of 
that.  That's why I said it is a toy patch, and I did not mean it for 
inclusion.  It was just a nice time waster for me; it's not even something 
I'd find terribly useful myself, unless it asked me if I wanted to execute 
this or that instead (provided that isatty()).

I wasn't.  At least I did not mean to.
