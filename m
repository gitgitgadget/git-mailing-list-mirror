Dear list,

Since Git's birth, a lot of useful blog posts have been published on
using Git and solving specific problems. Our wiki has the GitLinks
page, which has a number of blogs by Git people, but what I was
missing was a collection of links to specific blog posts.

Thus I created BlogPosts [http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/BlogPosts] with
the intention to assemble links to *single* and *useful* blog posts
related to *specific* Git usage. Posts linked from there should be
contained enough to be useful reference to people solving a specific
problem, and the link description should should adequately describe
the problem.

I am looking forward to your comments and contributions.
