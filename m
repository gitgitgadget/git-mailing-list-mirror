Afternoon everyone,

Just a quick heads up we are going to be taking master down for hardware
and software upgrades tomorrow, Thursday July 3rd 2008 at 15:00 UTC.
During this time all back-end services, including wiki's, ssh and
userweb to name a few things.

The hardware portion of the upgrade should be complete within an hour,
and the software upgrades will likely take another hour or two - though
even when master comes back up expect intermittent service for a few
hours after that while we deal with things.  Likely ETA for all work
completed is Friday July 4th 2008 at 00:00 UTC.  If there are
complications, I will kick another e-mail off with updates.

If you have any questions, comments or concerns please don't hesitate to
get ahold of me.
