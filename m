everything seems very consistent indeed, except one command:

   git-merge-base

I've already got used to it. but, at first, the name gave me the
impression that it merge the current branch with given base point.

the current documentation says:

   Finds as good a common ancestor as possible for a merge

so would it be better to rename it to:

   git-find-common-ancestor

That's what the command does after all.
