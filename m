I guess it depends on your definition of REALLY.  Sure, we won't access
a different host via curl (or a different protocol!), but I wouldn't
expect that. This is the credential subsystem.

If you're proposing to document it more clearly, I'm fine with that.

And if you want to tighten it up in a major release to ignore such input
from helpers, I'm fine with that, too. But I'd be worried pushing it out
in a maintenance release and finding out that somebody _is_ depending on
it somehow.
