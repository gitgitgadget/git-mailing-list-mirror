I think this approach is OK for string_list, but it doesn't help the
general case that wants qsort_s() to actually access global data. I
don't know how common that is in our codebase, though.

So I'm fine with it, but I think we might eventually need to revisit the
qsort_s() thing anyway.

I'm not sure if access to the util field is really of any value, after
looking at it in:

  http://public-inbox.org/git/20161125171546.fa3zpapbjngjcl26@sigill.intra.peff.net/

Though note that if we do take this patch, there are probably one or two
spots that could switch from QSORT() to string_list_sort().
