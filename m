I do not necessarily think that is a better title.  It not just
talks the project management, but a note from the maintainer in
general.  In the future it might talk about even more things.

Moderated newsgroups tend to have "foo.bar.baz FAQ" periodical
postings, but I'd rather not make me the authoritative FAQ
maintainer, as git is about distributed development and
borrowing the convention from heavily-centralized moderated
world feels wrong.  Besides, it is something that does not have
to be done by me.

I just expected people to pay attention to what the maintainer
has to say (in addition to what the well known list regulars
have to say), if they wanted to know what the project is about,
and "A note from the maintainer" (the message _always_ had that
title) would be a good enough title for finding that.

Any volunteers to maintain FAQ for the list?
