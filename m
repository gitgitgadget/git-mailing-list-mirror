Dear Colleagues,

We are organizing now many special issues in several ISI (SCI, SCIE, ESCI) and Scopus
indexed Journals
of WITPress / Springer / Elsevier / IET / AIP / IEEE / CRC etc.....

Send us your paper by email as soon as possible in IEEE Format (.doc)
All the papers will pass via peer review.

Fees: Start from 400 USD  (all the papers will pass via peer review)

We will propose you the Journal and if you agree we will start the review process.
You will pay directly to this Journal (directly to the Publisher)
using my name:   Dr. John Phili 

Send your paper to me by email until July 31, 2021

Note that because of many articles' submission, we can offer better fees than the
Publishers themselves. You will pay to the Publishers directly, not to us.
Contact me by phone or by email.
Thanks

Dr. John Phili
University of Oregon
