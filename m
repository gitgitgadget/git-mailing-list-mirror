I would very much agree with that. There are projects that I have posted
multiple years, and nobody ever selects them. I should take that as a
hint that they are not appealing to students for whatever reason, and
are probably just clogging up the ideas list.

I'd make an exception for somebody who wants to substantially rework the
proposal in an attempt to make it more appealing, or who has a reason
why it is being re-proposed (e.g., we had student interest, but we ended
up not selecting it due to running out of slots or something). But those
should be the exception.
