Thanks for looking at this. There are a lot of short-comings in the
current bitmap implementation, so if there's a better way to do things,
I'm not opposed to moving to a new format. :)

Right. I actually had trouble coming up with a succinct way of
describing this, and stole the definition from your recent blog post. ;)

I think I may have confused things by starting my description with a
hypothetical combined want/have walk. To take a step back: the problem
we were discussing is that we spend a lot of time reading trees to fill
in the "have" bitmap, even though most of those objects are unlikely to
be in the "want" in the first place (only the frontier trees are really
useful).

The current code does indeed fill the "have" bitmap first (so that while
walking "want", it can avoid walking down paths whose bits we know we're
going to clear eventually anyway). But we can't know the frontier if we
completely fill the "have" bitmap first. We have to walk both sides
together, looking for the frontier.

Yes, and that's how the current code works. If we walk back to B and it
has a bitmap, we can stop walking there and just OR in its bitmap, and
look at the trees for any intermediate commits (in this case just C) to
fill in the rest.

The problem is that we don't have a bitmap for every commit. So you can
imagine a history like this:

  A_1 -- A_2 -- ... -- A_1000 -- B -- C
                                   \
				    D

where we have a bitmap _only_ for D. Filling in the accurate and true
bitmap for C requires walking a thousand commits (and their trees!),
when the non-bitmap algorithm would find the frontier at B and call that
good enough.

Right, but it may be in the pack but without a bitmap. We don't store a
bitmap for every commit. The idea was to save space, but select some key
commits that let us generally find a bitmap with a small amount of
walking. And most of the time it works fine. But in some cases, we seem
to find pathological cases where we do quite a lot of walking.

As I said earlier in the thread, I suspect our commit selection is not
great. It's mostly some heuristics we threw together in 2013, and I
don't think it was tested very thoroughly. So fixing that may be a
simpler approach.

What I was wondering here was whether we could get an easy fix based on
the same frontier ideas that the non-bitmap walk uses.

Right, this is _way_ simpler. But it necessarily means spending effort
to find the complete "haves", because we don't know which parts are
useful.

But doing that commit walk to find the frontier negates part of the
purpose of using the bitmaps, which is avoiding even walking commits.
Going back to a variant of our example:

  A -- B -- C_1 -- .. -- C_1000
        \
	 D_1 -- .. -- D_1000

If we have a bitmap at C_1000 and D_1000, we don't have to walk any
commits at all. But finding the frontier requires walking 2000 commits.

Is there a way to find it with just bitmaps? You can certainly find the
intersection, but you don't have any idea which of the many shared
commits is the merge base. Of course in this example you don't actually
care about the frontier (you have the full answer immediately). But how
do you decide which way to optimize: try to avoid walking commits to
get a quick answer from bitmaps, or prefer to walk some commits to find
the frontier and avoid opening too many trees?
