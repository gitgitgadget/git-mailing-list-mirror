Figure I may as well answer this, given it's addressed to me :)

Yes, but happy to participate in technical events via telemetry.

Sure, but only if several people thought it would be worth blowing US
$1400 of community funds on my ticket ... that's what it costs to get
across the Pacific!

The summit time is actually quite good for me.

The main reason I'd be interested in joining would be to talk to people
about the gittorrent project, or any other similar "cloud computing"
over git ideas.  There was a bit of difference of opinions, and some
divergence of ideas that was possibly avoidable.  It would be good to
"crack out" the concepts with a group of people "in person".  I'm pretty
sure there's already a videoconference setup at Catalyst, or if not
there could be one jimmied up easily enough.  So that might be a nice
cheap thing to do - I can give a 30 minute overview of the technology,
and hopefully participate in group discussion for another 30 minutes (or
as long as people are interested in the discussion really).

Of course I'd equally like to meet people... that's all good and
fun :-).  And I've got connections in Portland as well.  I just think
it's probably not the best use of community funds.

> 	5: Would you volunteer to help organize it?

I'd volunteer for anything, but you'd better turn it down I'd be
hopeless ;-).
