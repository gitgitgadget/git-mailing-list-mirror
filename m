I care less about squeezing out the last few percent performance and
more that somebody libc qsort_r() might offer some other improvement.
For instance, it could sort in-place to lower memory use for some cases,
or do some clever thing that gives more than a few percent in the real
world (something like TimSort).

I don't know to what degree we should care about that.

Fun, but probably insane for our not-very-threadsafe code base. :)
