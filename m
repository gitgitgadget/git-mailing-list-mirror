Hi,

I still think Oct 10 (a Friday) is a good date.
This is ~6 weeks - other opinions?

Ok, I've written a text that can be seen as some kind of announcement
template for news on {Open Source,programming,Linux}-related news sites.

Git User's Survey Begins


Two weeks after the major release of Git version 1.6.0,
the Git community starts a survey containing 60 questions
that can help to understand the users' needs, behavior,
and what they like and dislike about Git.

<a href="http://git.or.cz">Git</a> is a distributed source code
management system (or in other words: distributed version control system)
that was initially written by Linus Torvalds for the Linux kernel
development after the proprietary BitKeeper system stopped being
free of charge in 2005.
Quickly Git gained popularity and other Open Source projects like
<a href="http://www.x.org/wiki/Development/git">X.org</a>,
<a href="http://git.videolan.org/">VLC</a> or
<a href="http://www.winehq.org/site/git">WINE</a>
began to use it.

There have already been user surveys in
<a href="http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/GitSurvey">2006</a> and
<a href="http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/GitSurvey2007">2007</a>.
Since then, a lot has changed.

Git users are called upon to answer the questions until Oct 10, 2008.
After that date, the results can be found on the
<a href="http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/GitSurvey2008">Git Wiki</a>
in CSV format and in some evaluated form.

  or: http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/GitSurvey2008

Of course, this is open for improvements and discussion.

BTW, this is explicitly _not_ meant for Git-specific web sites.
There the announcement of the last year might be sufficient, in
some slightly changed form:

--8<--
<a href="...">The Git User's Survey</a> is up!

Please devote a few minutes of your time to fill this simple questionnaire.
It will help the Git community to understand your needs, what you like of
Git, and, of course, what you don't like of it.

Regards,
  Stephan
