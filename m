Ah, good point.

Perhaps "git corporate hooks" or "git enterprise hooks".

I'm a little cautious about using words like corporate/enterprise as
there is nothing exclusively "corporate/enterprise" about any of the
hooks in the project, we just happened to be on a corporate/enterprise
project when we came up with them.

"git enterprise hooks" seems like a potentially good name. I can't see
people googling explicitly for the "enterprise" keyword, but the "git
hooks" seems fairly likely.

Suggestions are welcome and thanks for the feedback.
