How are you invoking the log? Are you doing:

  git log app/Controller/CustomerCardVerificationController.php

or similar? If that is the case, then history simplification may be
causing the results you see. And even you don't _see_ any merges in the
output, that is because they were simplified away. And the commit you
are looking for may have been on a side branch that was simplified away.

If you do:

  git log --full-history app/...

does the commit you are interested in show up? If so, then it was
removed due to history simplification. And if you are surprised that a
side branch was simplified away, that is most likely because there is a
mis-merge in your history (some merge which threw away the changes on a
side branch).

Try:

  git log --graph --oneline --name-status --full-history app/...

to see the whole shape of history, including which commits touched the
file.

You can read more about it in the "History Simplification" section of
"git help log".
