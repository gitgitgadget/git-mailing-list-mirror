What about Discordian dates? You seem to be having so much fun and I'd 
hate to spoil it for you. :)

It should be easier than Gregorian ones too.

5 months with 73 days each; Chaos, Discord, Confusion, Bureaucracy, The 
Aftermath
5 days: Sweetmorn, Boomtime, Pungenday, Prickle-Prickle, Setting Orange

February 29 is "St. Tibs day".

For years, just tack on 1166 and you're good to go.

It'd be just lovely to be able to say
	git whatchanged --since=chaos

Incidentally, git was first released in "Discord" which seems somehow 
appropriate. :)
