Who is "you"?  You are replying to a post of mine, yet commenting on
Alex.

I am neither disciplined nor meticulous, yet have designed and
programmed applications and complete systems in assembly language.
Programmers can easily survive assembly language without being
disciplined or meticulous.  Their projects can't: they get tied to the
programmers.  Porting an assembly language application to a different
processor might be easier than porting it to another programmer.

It is a good way to measure programmers, at least concerning some
interesting metrics.
