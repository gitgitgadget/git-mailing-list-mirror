relationship with you.

My father was poisoned to death by his business associates on one of
their outings on a business trip. Before his death in a private
hospital in Abidjan he secretly called me on his bed side and told me
that he has the sum of ($12.000,000 MILLION US DOLLAR) kept with a
security and finance company in South Africa,He also explained to me
that it was because of this wealth that he was poisoned by his
business associates,that I should seek for a beneficiary in any
country of my choice where I will transfer this money and use it for
investment.I am honorably seeking for your assistance to transfer our
fund out of South Africa.Upon the successful transfer of this fund,we
shall make arrangement for me,my mother and younger sister to come
over to your country to further our Education and invest in a
profitable business that you may suggest.

More over,I am willing to offer you 20% of the total sum as
compensation for your effort/input after the successful transfer of
this fund into your nominated bank account overseas.

As we depend on God, and with God all things are possible.
Anticipating to hear from you today.

Thanks and God bless.
