This is known; the issue is tests that run shell functions or subshells
and capture their stderr (which then get polluted by "-x" output). You
can either:

  - run the tests with bash, which uses BASH_XTRACEFD to send output
    directly to the terminal (see TEST_SHELL_PATH in recent versions)

  - try 'next'; GÃ¡bor has done some work recently to clean up tests so
    that this works even with non-bash shells. See the sg/test-x and
    sg/cvs-tests-with-x topics.
