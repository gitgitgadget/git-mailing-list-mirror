True, though it would be easy enough to do:

  git -c alias.yes='!while true; do echo y; done' yes

Yes. :)

Maybe, though now we may be diverging from how git.c uses the pager. As
gross as what I wrote is, it is testing the code we want to test, I
think. I am not sure that the alias vs builtin thing is worth caring
about anyway, though, in which case the alias.yes thing above would be
fine.
