Bogofilter ate two messages today that I tried to send to this
mailing list.  At least I got back bounce messages from it.

I'm not quite sure how to fix either message to get them to the list.
Neither email was a patch so I'm not going to try resending them
but I'm certainly a little curious as to how my email writing style
twice tripped bogofilter's spam switch.
