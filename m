I remember that last time I checked, there were a number of designs for 
subprojects and at least a couple of implementations, but none that was 
complete to the point of being mergeable. Are there any subproject 
implementations available that haven't run into unsolveable problems? I'm 
presently only looking at stuff that totals to a reasonable single project 
size and rate of growth, so I'm not worried about the large-scale storage 
requirement issue.
