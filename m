I liked the groupings of the commands on the doc/reference page 
http://git-scm.com/docs (plural).
I felt they were reasonably grouped and relatively inviting to explore.

The visual cheatsheet looks interesting and informative, though wasn't what 
I was expecting from its title - perhaps "interactive cheatsheet"?
[If they did a composite with all the cheats in cascade it'd make a good 
printout]
