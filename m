Hi Josh

Thanks for the update

I think it depends on how many new tests we think we're going to want to 
add here. I can see us adding a few more check_* macros (comparing 
object ids and arrays of bytes spring to mind) and wanting to test them 
here, but (perhaps naÃ¯vely) I don't expect huge amounts of churn here.

In principle we could pass the location information along to any helper 
function, I'm not sure how easy that is at the moment. We can get 
reasonable error messages by using the check*() macros in the helper and 
wrapping the call to the helper with check() as well. For example

static int assert_sane_strbuf(struct strbuf *buf)
{
	/* Initialized strbufs should always have a non-NULL buffer */
	if (!check(!!buf->buf))
		return 0;
	/* Buffers should always be NUL-terminated */
	if (!check_char(buf->buf[buf->len], ==, '\0'))
		return 0;
	/*
	 * Freshly-initialized strbufs may not have a dynamically allocated
	 * buffer
	 */
	if (buf->len == 0 && buf->alloc == 0)
		return 1;
	/* alloc must be at least one byte larger than len */
	return check_uint(buf->len, <, buf->alloc);
}

and in the test function call it as

	check(assert_sane_strbuf(buf));

which gives error messages like

# check "buf->len < buf->alloc" failed at t/unit-tests/t-strbuf.c:43
#    left: 5
#   right: 0
# check "assert_sane_strbuf(&buf)" failed at t/unit-tests/t-strbuf.c:60

So we can see where assert_sane_strbuf() was called and which assertion 
in assert_sane_strbuf() failed.

Unless someone has an immediate need for that I'd be tempted to leave it 
wait until someone requests that data.

Hopefully the unit tests will run fast enough that we don't need to 
worry about that in the early stages.

> - Provide guidelines for writing new unit tests

This is not a comprehensive list but we should recommend that

- tests avoid leaking resources so the leak sanitizer see if the code
   being tested has a resource leak.

- tests check that pointers are not NULL before deferencing them to
   avoid the whole program being taken down with SIGSEGV.

- tests are written with easy debugging in mind - i.e. good diagnostic
   messages. Hopefully the check* macros make that easy to do.

Thanks for the updates to the test library, the range diff looks good to me.

 > - Removed testing of some strbuf implementation details in t-strbuf.c

I agree that makes sense. I think it would be good to update 
assert_sane_strbuf() to use the check* macros as suggest above.

Best Wishes
