the git developers (and the portion of the community that they represent) 
tend to care far more about the content of the contribution (either in 
documentation or in code) than who the author is.

I agree that if user pages aren't wanted on the wiki they should just be 
disabled, but for whatever reason they are not.

there is a lot of spamming happening nowdays in wikis and other web 
forums, so it's not too surprising to me that a page that is just 'this is 
who I am and here is a link to my blog' would be considered spam. There 
are companies who are out there trying to get improved google ratings by 
having lots of pages with links to their page. many of them do this by 
buying lots of domains and hosting them in different places, but there are 
a lot that are unethical enough to put pages very similar to what you 
describe as having posted on any site they can manage to get into.

so, what Michael posted really is true (or at least very close to true), 
the git community really doesn't care who you are, feel free to contibute, 
ask questions, etc. As you contribute you will build a reputation within 
git, but you will never be grilled about your outside expericance, and 
unless you have something directly related to what you are submitting 
(i.e. I did this before, <here> and it worked really well) nobody will 
care about it.



Remember that when Linus started coding linux, he was a nobody, and the 
established experts were telling him that what he was doing was the wrong 
way to do anything. With that sort of background, the community cares 
about what you do, not who you are.
