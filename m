Could you please do not toppost?  It is against natural reading order.

=46irst, having patch as attachement, moreover as _binary_ and _encoded=
_=20
attachement makes it hard to comment on it.  And if you make it hard to=
=20
comment on patch, people woundn't do it.

Second, your approach with "--pretty=3Dformat:%s%n%b" might be a good
idea, but you don't get all the information as you get from=20
git-cat-file: no tree info, no true (recorded) parents info, no=20
committer info, no author info.  I don't know if git-cvsserver makes=20
use of that info or not; from the patch it looks as if it discards
all but commit message (message body).=20

BTW. I'm not Perl expert, but if you want to discard two last
elements in arrays, wouldn't using splice (or just decreasing
$#lines by 2) be simpler solution?

About git-log vs git-cat-file: take a look how gitweb does it, with=20
parse_commits and parse_commit_text, and commit 756bbf548dbef5b738c
by Robert Fitzsimons introducing it.  Note that IIRC this commit
predates --pretty=3Dformat:<fmt> option to git-log / git-rev-list.

You have either configure sendmail, or set mail.smtp* options (or=20
something like that) correctly.

BTW. cannot you turn off "format=3Dflowed" in Apple Mail?
