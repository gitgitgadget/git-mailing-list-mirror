That central header is already quite crowded.  A bit of isolation might 
not hurt.

Furthermore, other platforms might wish to add their own (re)definitions 
for those byte swap operations, so it has the potential to grow.  I for 
example have a better implementation for ARM than what is provided by 
glibc.  (Yeah yeah, maybe glibc should be fixed instead, but that 
reasoning goes for all those other libraries too).

You get it by default for all platforms already by including 
git-compat-util.h.  The compat/bswap.h is not meant to be included by 
random c files.  If compat/bswap.h happens to contain a better version 
for your architecture then it'll override the default one.
