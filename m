Hi,

Is there a mechanism for exchanging the rerere resolutions, so that 
future fixups, e.g. future clashes on pu rather than master, can be sent 
with patch series?

My current use case that there is a large patch [1] for updating long to 
size_t for use on Windows, which notes that it will have clashes with 
pu, but doesn't appear to have any methodÂ  of sending a rerere 
resolution (which the author is already aware of) to the list. Being 
able to flag up such fixes should simplify such conflict resolutions.

I had some very rough ideas about how the resolutions should look rather 
similar to three-way conflict markers, with the resolution as the 'base' 
(between the ||| - ||| marks), which would be resolved via a --base 
merge strategy.

However if there is already a method for exchanging resolutions, where 
should I look?

Philip

instead of 'unsigned long' for data in memory
