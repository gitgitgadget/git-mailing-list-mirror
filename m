Sorry, about that but I was starting to loose things with all the gigantic 
... thread.  I wanted to be able to see some things happen, from the long 
thread and felt that having the CC list as long as it was was not 
assisting in getting a resolution.

I prefered the way it was done.  I would have hated the messages in my 
cron jobs.  Some of my cronjobs have everything going to /dev/null  When I 
am unable to convice the project to eliminate things like the above, I am 
forced to /dev/null them to be able to use them in a way that is not to 
annoying for me.  I really liked the way things were done with the 
exception of maybe a bit better communication.  But there will always be 
whiners.  Just want an other way to emphazise that things are going to 
change.  Maybe it will stop a few.

Thanks again for the good work done by all in the community.
