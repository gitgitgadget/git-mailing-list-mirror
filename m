Yes. It's the output of git-request-pull.

I might very well have been one of them.

Adding cover message template support for shortlog and aggregate
diffstat should be straightforward. I might get to it some time in the
not too distant future if no one else beats me to it. As for the pull
line, that's another story; git-request-pull actually seems to connect
to that repository and check its contents, and I'm not convinced
that's a good thing for stg-mail to be doing. But that's the least
wanted item of the three anyway, I guess.
