Respecting the repo's .gitattributes would feel right. It seems unusual 
(to me) that it bypasses $REMOTE/.gitattributes, but DOES check 
$REMOTE/info/attributes.

Cheers. I've submitted my patch now. I hope I have the doc syntax right.

Ah, no, you were right in your first assumption. I just wanted 
git-archive to apply gitattributes to the resulting tarball.
(I should have phrased that last line as "..apply to commands connecting 
to a remote repo.." and it would make more sense.)
