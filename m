Thanks for the explanation, I see what you're trying to do. I don't have 
a strong feeling either way, I can see the potential advantage but as it 
changes strings that are currently translated I'm not sure it is cost 
free. Do you know how the translators feel about the change as they're 
the ones it is aimed at?

Best Wishes
