Well, it worked for cloneurl.

Okay, I agree with you. We need to centralize information.
One idea use $GIT_DIR/config only, sharing any other information. But I
don't like the idea do parse $GIT_DIR/config everytime. Unless it caches
gitweb only information in one line.

Another Idea is to use $GIT_DIR/gitweb.conf with information [like the
cached above], but generated by the gitweb admin.

Other to continue with all those files, but creating a gitweb.d/* .

That's what I can think 1:02am =(

Good night
