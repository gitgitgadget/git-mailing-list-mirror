I think that would be worth doing, definitely. I do worry a little bit
about locking in low-quality deltas (or lack thereof), but more on that
below...

Yep, agreed. Like I said earlier, I think there are some niche scenarios
where we just care about "would this merge cleanly?", but in most other
cases we want to keep around the actual tree.

Yes, the bulk-checkin mechanism suffers from an even worse problem which
is the pack it creates will contain no deltas whatsoever. The contents
of the pack are just getting written as-is, so there's no fancy
delta-ficiation going on.

I think Michael Haggerty (?) suggested to me off-list that it might be
interesting to have a flag that we could mark packs with bad/no deltas
as such so that we don't implicitly trust their contents as having high
quality deltas.

This covers both blobs and trees, since IIUC that's all we'd need to
implement support for merge-tree to be able to write any objects it
creates into a pack. AFAIK merge-tree never generates any commit
objects. But teaching 'merge' to perform the same bulk-checkin trick
would just require us implementing index_bulk_commit_checkin_in_core()
or similar, which is straightforward to do on top of the existing code.

Thanks,
Taylor
