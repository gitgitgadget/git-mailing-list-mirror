Obviousness is in the eye of the beholder.  This is a fact that I tend=20
to forget just too easily as well.

You probably didn't intend it, but your sentences at the top can be rea=
d=20
more like: "This is a logical consequence.  If you don't understand=20
that, your mental capabilities must be lacking.".  That's obviously=20
(ha!) a rude thing to say.

Also, and I'm sure you didn't know that, "Jedem das Seine" (to each his=
=20
own) was the slogan of the Buchenwald concentration camp.  For that=20
reason some (including me) hear the unspoken cynical half-sentence "and=
=20
some people just have to be sent to the gas chamber" when someone uses=20
this proverb.

No accusations intended, just trying to answer your question from my=20
point of view.
