> Interesting use-case.

My use case really was a simple =E2=80=9Cimport a range of tarballs for
bisecting=E2=80=9D. That they were from git was a surprise, but I don't=
 have
access to that repo, which for all I know is full of junk and not meant
for publication, so I'm not trying to get the original history.

I just want importing to work on tarballs found in the wild.

Someone with stronger perl-fu to parse the hash comment could print on
stderr (keep me CC-ed if you do that):
  This tarball was generated by git, from commit id $SHA1.

It will serve as a hint when the person doing the import has access to
the original history. I don't think there's a point in keeping a sha1
when there's no access; keeping it in the history would confuse people,
or require sticking a longer explanation to each of these commits.
