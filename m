Hrm. I'm not sure how we're supposed to have a block-within-a-block in
asciidoctor, and that may be something we want to fix in the long run.
But I agree this block around all of the options is not doing anything
useful, and the simplest solution here is just to get rid of it.

It dates all the way back to d145144c3b (Document git-init, 2007-01-11),
so perhaps it did something useful in an ancient version of asciidoc.
