    3. What platforms (hardware, OS, version) do you use GIT on?
    4. How many people do you collaborate with using GIT?

            your liking?
    2. Do you subscribe to the mailing list?
          * If yes, do you find it useful, and traffic levels OK?
    3. Do you use the IRC channel (#git on irc.freenode.net)?
          * If no, did you know that all of the core developers use
            IRC, and that there's almost 24-hour help available?
