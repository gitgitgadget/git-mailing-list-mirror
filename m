Does this last sentence still holds, given that a submodule plays a
crucial role in triggering this bug?  I think it either doesn't, or
I still don't completely understand the situation.

I'm inclined to agree that using a flag that is not used anywhere else
is the safest thing to do, and at -rcX time safest is good.  I'm not
sure whether it's the right thing to do in the long term, though.

Furthermore, calling this flag REACHABLE is misleading, because the
code actually means SEEN.
Consider the following sequence of commands:

  # Create a pack with two commits
  $ git commit --allow-empty -m one &&
  $ git commit --allow-empty -m two &&
  $ git repack -ad &&
  # Make one of those commits unreachable
  $ git reset --hard HEAD^ &&
  # Not even from reflogs!
  $ git reflog expire --expire-unreachable=now --all
  # Now write a commit-graph from that pack file
  $ git commit-graph write
  Computing commit graph generation numbers: 100% (2/2), done.

It added two commits to the commit-graph, although one of them is
clearly not reachable anymore, so marking it as REACHABLE while
enumerating all commits feels wrong.
