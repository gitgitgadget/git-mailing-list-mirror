Yes, though generation numbers can help with more questions (e.g., "what
is the merge base").

This is one of the open questions. My older patches turned them off when
replacements and grafts are in effect.

At GitHub we are using them for --contains analysis, along with mass
ahead/behind (e.g., as in https://github.com/gitster/git/branches). My
plan is to send patches upstream, but they need some cleanup first.
