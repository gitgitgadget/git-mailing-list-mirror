Hi Elijah

[I've cc'd Martin to see if he has anything to add about how "jj" 
manages the issues around storing conflicts.]

One thing to think about if we ever want to implement this is what other 
data we need to store along with the conflict trees to preserve the 
context in which the conflict was created. For example the files that 
are read by "git commit" when it commits a conflict resolution. For a 
single cherry-pick/revert it would probably be fairly straight forward 
to store CHERRY_PICK_HEAD/REVERT_HEAD and add it as a parent so it gets 
transferred along with the conflicts. For a sequence of cherry-picks or 
a rebase it is more complicated to preserve the context of the conflict. 
Even "git merge" can create several files in addition to MERGE_HEAD 
which are read when the conflict resolution is committed.

I think this is a really important point, while it can be useful to 
share conflicts so they can be collaboratively resolved we don't want to 
propagate them into "stable" or production branches. I wonder how 'jj' 
handles this.

As you point out there is a lot more to this than just being able to 
store the conflict data in a commit - in many ways I think that is the 
easiest part of the solution to sharing conflicts.
