The performance impact of the exhaustive search for --color scales with
the number of shown lines, while it would scale with the total number of
lines for --column.  Coloring the results of highly selective patterns
is relatively cheap, short-circuiting them still helps significantly.

Disabling that optimization for --column wouldn't be a regression since
it's a new option..  Picking a random result (based on the order of
evaluation) seems sloppy and is probably going to surprise users.

We could add an optimizer pass to reduce the number of regular
expressions in certain cases if that is really too slow.  E.g. this:

	$ git grep -e b -e a

... is equivalent to:

	$ git grep -e '\(b\)\|\(a\)'

In that example the optimizer should use a single kwset instead of a
regex, but you get the idea, namely to leave the short-circuiting to the
regex engine or kwset, which probably do a good job of it.
