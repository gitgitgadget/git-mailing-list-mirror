(You mean the Git Tutorial by Linus:
=20
http://linuxplumbersconf.org/program/speakers/getspeaker.php?speaker=3D=
ltorvalds.txt)

So yes it could be part of the Plumbers Conference or just after it.

If it's part of the Conference, I wonder if people only interested by t=
he=20
GitTogether will have to pay the Conference registration fee (300$)?

In Portland, OR there will be:

- September 15(Mon)-16(Tue): Kernel Summit 2008=20
(https://www.linuxfoundation.org/events/kernel)

- September 17(Wed)-19(Fry): Linux Plumbers Conference
(http://linuxplumbersconf.org/)

So the GitTogether could perhaps be just after that:

- September 20(Sat)-21(Sun): GitTogether

as some people might just want to come during a weekend and other might=
 want=20
to come for 5 days or even one full week (if they are invited to the Ke=
rnel=20
Summit)?

The main problem is that it's a bit late for this year.

Thanks,
Christian.
