apologize for the confusion, the only discussion was the one I had
with myself late at night when I realized that specific corruption
was not being detected, and might be related to issues that seemed
to be common[1]

the problem is that practically speaking, if users in Windows and Macs
edited the file they "might" had saved lines with the wrong line ending (*)
(part of the reason I added a warning about "encoding" to the documentation),
and those are difficult to "see" as invalid.

using the non _lf() version ensures any trailing '\r' character would
get removed from the credential and allow us to use them, instead of
silently failing.

originally I added a explicit check for it, which I assume you would prefer
but .. 

> So, I am not sure why this change is desirable.

to give users immediate relief from what seems to be a commonly seen issue.

IMHO after we get this released out and they see the updated documentation
explaining the risks, and some learn how to fix their credential files (
and hopefully use an editor that lets them see the problem); we could then
add also a detection for this edge case and go back to _lf()

I also had to admit I might had overreacted, as I was testing before v8 with
a very corrupted file and was seeing warnings twice on each operation and
somehow even got myself into the original fatal, which I had to admit I can't
replicate now after some needed rest.

(*) textedit, which comes with macOS doesn't even write an EOF record when
    creating files, for example, and that behaviour seems to be common for
    most other native editors but a credential line WITHOUT line ending works
