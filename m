Hmm, yeah, that's an easy solution that covers the overlap case, too. If
the generated code is the same, that seems like it might not be bad (I
am a little sad how complex this simple swap operation is getting,
though).

Yeah, I guess it would be pretty odd. I was thinking of swapping a
struct and one of its components, but that fail the size equality check.
And anyway that would be a silly thing to do in the first place, so it's
probably not worth thinking too much about.

Yeah, I think we can live without it. I was mostly trying to think
through whether there were worse cases than the one we saw. But you've
convinced me that there probably aren't.

My reasoning was that there's a bug, and the patch does the minimal fix.
I don't mind making a readability improvement on top, but the two are
orthogonal. I.e., you could still write:

  for (i = 0, j = queue->nr - 1; i <= j; i++, j--)

which is more readable but still buggy. :)
