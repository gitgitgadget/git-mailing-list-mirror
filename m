Ideally yeah, I'd like to see the verbose (even "-x") log of the failed
test. But even an indication of a failure is enough that I know I can
start digging (and bonus if I can then dig into the log with a script
and parse it myself).

Thanks, I may poke around that.  In this particular case, though, I was
wondering about the Azure Pipelines builds that Dscho has put together.

Mostly I just want to see the status of my own topics (ideally as soon
as they're available, but even polling to get them within a few hours
would be OK). I run the tests locally, of course, but sometimes problems
show up on other platforms.
