Also, if this event would indeed be in US, some of the developers would
need to arrange visa, which takes time too (though the time can vary,
reportedly - but 30 days should be enough).

I'm slightly discouraged by the idea of getting the visa, which is
reportedly exhausting process involving handing over huge amount of
personal information to US government etc.  But I might wind up having
to travel to US sooner or later anyway, so I guess it's not a
deal-breaker for me.
