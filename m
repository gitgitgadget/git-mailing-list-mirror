Agreed for another series.  I've also found myself wishing khash
used enums.  But I'm also not sure how much changing of 3rd
party code we should be doing...

No JS here for godbolt, but there's also a bunch of "!fspathcmp"
here that could probably be changed to fspatheq.

Yeah, I think fspathhash should be path_hash in merge-recursive.c
(and path_hash eliminated).

I don't have performance numbers, and I doubt hash function
performance is much overhead, here.  I used X31 since it was
local to khash.

I would prefer we only have one non-cryptographic hash
implementation to reduce cognitive overhead, so maybe we can
drop X31 entirely for FNV-1.  I'd also prefer we only have khash
or hashmap, not both.

*shrug* I'll let somebody with more appropriate systems do
benchmarks, there.  But it could be an easy switch once
fspathhash is in place.
