Yes, I think sorting the expect file would work fine. I'm OK with that,
or just leaving a comment. The comment has the bonus that it does not
cost an extra process at runtime. I'd probably use a sort if we expected
the list to be long and complicated, since it makes life easier on a
future developer. But since there are only 2 lines, I don't think it's a
big deal either way (or even just leaving it as-is without a comment is
probably OK).

I suspect it would occasionally be useful, but I don't recall it coming
up all that often.
