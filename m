The generated diff is wrong.

A filepair that changes type must be split into deletion followed by
creation, which means the "index" line should say 0{40} on the right hand
side for the first half and then 0{40} on the left hand side for the
second half.  The patch generated by this step:

> +test_expect_success 'create patch' '
> +	git diff-tree --binary HEAD^ HEAD >patch

However says the blob contents change from "\0" to "file" on both.

This is because diff.c::run_diff() computes "index" only once and reuses
it for both halves.
