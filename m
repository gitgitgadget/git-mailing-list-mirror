I've now had another session on the wiki (git.wiki.kernel.org) where
I've deleted spam that's piling up. It seems as the policy is to place
deleted pages into [[Category:Deleted]], and that's what I've done.
Can someone with the necessary muscles visit that category and delete
the pages that's in that category? It will be much easier to find new
spam pages when they're deleted. At the moment ther=CD=84e's 179 pages =
in
that category, so a little cleanup would be nice.

Also, there are lots of spambots registering spam users there, this
pollutes the user database and Special:RecentChanges . Would it be
possible to set up a CAPTCHA when trying to register an account? This
has been of great help at the wikis I'm helping out with. Before the
CAPTCHA, serveral hundred new spam users every day, after the CAPTCHA
was installed, not a single one.
