Yes, it is enabled by default and the only way to disable it is the 
GIT_TEST_DISABLE_EOIE environment variable.

The tests in t1700-split-index.sh assume that there are no extensions in 
the index file so anything that adds an extension, will break one or 
more of the tests.

First in 'enable split index', they hard code SHA values assuming there 
are no extensions. If some option adds an extension, these hard coded 
values no longer match and the test fails.

Later in 'disable split index' they save off the SHA of the index with 
split-index turned off and then in later tests, compare it to the SHA of 
the shared index.  Because extensions are stripped when the shared index 
is written out this only works if there were not extensions in the 
original index.

I'll document this behavior and reasoning in the test directly.

This did cause me to reexamine how EOIE and IEOT behave when split index 
is turned on.  These two extensions help most with a large index.  When 
split index is turned on, the large index is actually the shared index 
as the index is now the smaller set of deltas.

Currently, the extensions are stripped out of the shared index which 
means they are not available when they are needed to quickly load the 
shared index.  I'll see if I can update the patch so that these 
extensions are still written out and available in the shared index to 
speed up when it is loaded.

Thanks!
