Hello Bryan, hello Marc,

Does this apply to Mac OS X as well? I helped someone recently who had
trouble with renamed files (case change only) in a repository residing
on a case-insensitive HFS+ file system. Setting core.ignoreCase
explicitly (apparently it didn't get set automatically during clone for
some reason) helped; the files are recognised correctly now and the
case-only rename could be pulled. Is the post-clone change insufficient
on Mac OS X? Do we need to replace the existing repository and clone
again using '--config core.ignoreCase=true' to avoid future issues?


PS: Including the message-id of the mail being referenced would be
    useful; the id in the URL you gave is specific to the service being
    used (public-inbox.org) and cannot be used to reference the mail in
    any other archive (local or public). If you use the mid:<message-id>
    syntax (RFC 1630) some MUAs can even recognise the link and open the
    mail directly.
