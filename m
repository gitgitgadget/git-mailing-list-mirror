I wasn't following this series closely, but having seen your fix below,
I'm inclined to agree with you. Just because we _can_ allow options
before or after sub-commands does not necessarily make it a good idea.

There is a distinct meaning to options before/after the command for the
base "git" command (e.g., "git -C foo branch" versus "git branch -C
foo"), and I think that has been useful overall.

This patch looks like a sensible fix if we don't simply remove the "git
commit-graph --progress write" version.
