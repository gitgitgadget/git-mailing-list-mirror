I'm not sure I understand. Clearly this union aligns buf along the width
of git_max_align. But what about the preimage makes buf unaligned?

OK, the purpose of this union is to be as wide as the least common
alignment between uintmax_t and void *, yes?

...then the offset of the aligned field within the git_max_alignment
struct is going to be that common alignment? Could you not `#define
GIT_MAX_ALIGNMENT` to be `sizeof(git_max_align)` directly, or is there
something I'm missing?

I suppose the way you wrote it here is done in order to prevent padding
on the end of the git_max_align union from artificially increasing the
value of GIT_MAX_ALIGNMENT.

In any case, I *think* what you wrote here is right. The typedef's are
uncommon to our codebase, though. I wonder how much of this is all
necessary.

Thanks,
Taylor
