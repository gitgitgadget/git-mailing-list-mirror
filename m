I think this method was originally designed for debugging issues with
the index, and it still serves that purpose when someone is working on
it. The check for out-of-order directory/file conflicts probably exists
only for that case.

However, this method also got repurposed to (silently) check for the
real scenario of unmerged entries. Perhaps it would be better to split
these into two cases and move the silent case into a new method,
"has_unmerged_entries()".

Thank you for sending this. I started comparing the performance and
discovered that the performance difference I had measured before was
NOT consistent! I went back and debugged and found that 'git commit'
doesn't actually pass the silent flag, and my performance tests were
skewed by the filesystem cache. (A warmup of 3 runs was not sufficient
to get consistent numbers, it seemed. Perhaps the threaded index reads
are too inconsistent.)

This performs consistently worse than both cases (see performance test
later in this message). I think the strlen is saving us some time here.

In fact, I think the compiler is doing some magic to save our strlen
results, as I get identical performance results when doing this:

To get more consistent results, I modified my benchmark to be the following:

	git -c index.threads=1 commit --amend --allow-empty --no-edit

I also adjusted the test suite to use 5 warmup rounds. Here are the numbers:

  Benchmark #1: v2.30.0
    Time (mean Â± Ï):     856.6 ms Â±  18.0 ms    [User: 807.9 ms, System: 198.4 ms]
    Range (min â¦ max):   832.1 ms â¦ 882.2 ms    10 runs
 
So, 756.5ms average for v2.30.0.

  Benchmark #2: skipping the second loop
    Time (mean Â± Ï):     805.5 ms Â±  15.8 ms    [User: 758.0 ms, System: 197.1 ms]
    Range (min â¦ max):   783.4 ms â¦ 835.2 ms    10 runs
 
Here, I just deleted the second loop to see what is the potential minimum.

  Benchmark #3: storing this_name during second loop
    Time (mean Â± Ï):     855.6 ms Â±  14.1 ms    [User: 804.5 ms, System: 194.6 ms]
    Range (min â¦ max):   835.9 ms â¦ 875.2 ms    10 runs

The diff I provided earlier reduces the number of strlen() computations
by storing them across the loop iterations. There is no effect, which
makes me think the compiler is being smart.

  Benchmark #4: check for '/' before strncmp()
    Time (mean Â± Ï):     834.1 ms Â±  18.0 ms    [User: 786.6 ms, System: 196.7 ms]
    Range (min â¦ max):   803.5 ms â¦ 860.4 ms    10 runs 

HOWEVER, if we swap the order of the conditionals to be

		if (this_len < next_len &&
		    strncmp(this_name, next_name, this_len) == 0 &&
		    next_name[this_len] == '/') {

then we _do_ get a measurable, consistent speedup.

  Benchmark #5: using skip_prefix
    Time (mean Â± Ï):     877.3 ms Â±  16.1 ms    [User: 839.1 ms, System: 187.5 ms]
    Range (min â¦ max):   847.7 ms â¦ 900.4 ms    10 runs

This final benchmark stores the results for your skip_prefix diff.

Including the full ranges of the 10 runs hopefully assists in demonstrating
that the performance changes are (mostly) consistent.

To wrap up, I'm going to eject this patch from my v2 since more investigation
must be done to see if this second loop _can_ be dropped. At minimum, it isn't
properly silent when requested and there _is_ a performance boost possible,
even if we keep the check.

Thanks,
