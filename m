But I also have to get things working on 20 different Linux/UNIX/Unix-Like
variants.  So I have 20 different OS specific directories.  You would
think you could be a little more tolerant of a person new to the list.  I
submitted my patches to what I thought was a patch list, not a general
email list.  So, I am sorry for my ignorance of the list/patching ediquit.

I will follow it from now on, but I may drop membership to the list.  It
takes a lot of time and git is just one tool of many, I have to use.  I
still have to use bitkeeper for the sources that use them.  So please
allow me time to adjust to your methods.
