Are we sure that our list is the same as what is traversed? I won't be
surprised if it is true, but it doesn't seem immediately obvious from
the code:

So now we take in a set of objects...

But those objects aren't provided here. bisect_rev_setup() puts its own
set of objects into the pending list...

And then we traverse, and then...

...this is the first time we look at "rev".

If we already have the list of tips, could we just feed it ourselves to
bisect_rev_setup (I think that would require us remembering which were
"good" and "bad", but that doesn't seem like a big deal).

I'm not overly concerned that you've introduced a bug here, but just
wondering if we could make this a bit more maintainable going forward.
