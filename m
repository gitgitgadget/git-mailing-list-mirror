Hi Marco,

> Here is qgit-0.5, a git GUI viewer

Looking great so far!

Just a note though -- you don't seem to be using the SF Release System
correctly.  You've now got *two packages* called qgit, when what you want
is two *releases* in the qgit package.

Of course, I might be barking up the wrong tree and you meant to do it
like that all along.

Peter Brett

P.S. Any hope of integration into Konqueror? *begs pathetically*
