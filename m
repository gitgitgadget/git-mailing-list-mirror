I think there's some interest; I have received a few off-list emails
over the years about it. There was some preliminary discussion long ago:

  http://public-inbox.org/git/20110302164031.GA18233@sigill.intra.peff.net/

The code that runs on GitHub is available in my fork of git. I haven't
submitted it upstream because there are some lingering issues. I
mentioned them on-list in the first few items of:

  http://public-inbox.org/git/20130318121243.GC14789@sigill.intra.peff.net/

That code is in the jk/blame-tree branch of https://github.com/peff/git
if you are interested in addressing them (note that I haven't touched
that code in a few years except for rebasing it forward, so it may have
bitrotted a little).

Here's a snippet from an off-list conversation I had with Dennis (cc'd)
in 2014 (I think he uses that blame-tree code as part of a custom git
web interface):

That's all I could dig out of my archives. I'd be happy if somebody
wanted to pick it up and run with it. Polishing for upstream has been on
my list for several years now, but there's usually something more
important (or interesting) to work on at any given moment.

You might also look at how GitLab does it. I've never talked to them
about it, and as far as I know they do not use blame-tree.
