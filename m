Nicely explained.

Good. This is all sufficiently subtle that we definitely want to check
the related cases.

Wow, this is so much nicer than the older versions. :)

I wondered briefly whether this ought to only kick in when the user
didn't specify any refspecs. I.e., there is no way with this to say
"don't fetch refs/heads/*, but this other thing instead". But the way
the existing documentation is written, it's pretty clear that it's about
adding to the list of refspecs. We can always something like
"--no-default-refspec" later if somebody wants it.

Most of the rest of the patch is just swapping out "rs" for
"remote->fetch", which makes sense. So the implementation looks good to
me.

Checking one in and one out; nice.

Makes sense.

This relies on establishing grab/it in the previous test. A minor nit,
but we could break that more clear by breaking it out into its own
"set up refs for extra refspec tests" block.

Nice.

The whole thing looks very cleanly done.
