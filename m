Yep, obviously an improvement.

But as a general rule, I don't think we even need to include function
names here. The message would look like:

  BUG: list-objects-filter-options.c:20: list_object_filter_choice_name: invalid argument '3'

which already tells us where the code is[1]. Perhaps:

  BUG("invalid filter choice enum: %d", c);

would be shorter but equally informative (I don't overly care here,
since the idea is that nobody sees it, but just making a point about the
future).

-Peff

[1] Obviously it doesn't include the actual function name, though we
    could do so on many platforms by using __FUNCTION__. I tend to think
    it would make the messages overly long, but again, the hope is that
    nobody ever sees these.
