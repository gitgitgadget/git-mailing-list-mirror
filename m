It looks like tip_oids is meant as a fast lookup into what's in
unmatched and newlist. But in the second loop we continue appending to
newlist. Why is it OK that we do not update tip_oids when we do so?

I.e., something like this explains it:

diff --git a/fetch-pack.c b/fetch-pack.c
index 53914563b5..c0a1b80f4c 100644
--- a/fetch-pack.c
+++ b/fetch-pack.c
@@ -606,6 +606,12 @@ static void filter_refs(struct fetch_pack_args *args,
 			ref->match_status = REF_MATCHED;
 			*newtail = copy_ref(ref);
 			newtail = &(*newtail)->next;
+			/*
+			 * No need to update tip_oids with ref->old_oid; we got
+			 * here because either it was already there, or we are

+			 */
 		} else {
 			ref->match_status = REF_UNADVERTISED_NOT_ALLOWED;
 		}
