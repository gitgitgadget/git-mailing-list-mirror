It is obvious that you are a fresh subscriber, since the answer to your 
question is given multiple times a day. Not like in "This is why you 
cannot enhance SVN to behave as Git does", but more like in "This feature 
of Git allows you to do [...]".

I can only invite you to sift through the mail archive. I _could_ point 
you to a really recent mail from Linus, which explains very much why SVN 
just cannot do -- however hard you try -- what Git can. But then, you 
would miss out on so many other interesting emails which you haven't read 
yet.

So, now it is up to you to actually invest some time and learn something.

Ciao,
Dscho
