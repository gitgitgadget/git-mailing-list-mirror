OK, consuming the output at the helper level makes some sense to me.
But...

Isn't this existing code already trying to read everything? I think
rpc->out and client.out are synonyms.

So now instead of reading to EOF, we are reading some set number of
packets. This function is used for both fetches and pushes, isn't it? Is
the expected number of packets the same for both? What about
stateless-connect mode?

OK, so this is where we read the result. Which again, only makes sense
for send-pack. And in theory we've synchronized the protocol through the
packet reads above (are we sure that we always enter the read loop above
from a predictable synchronization point in the protocol, given that we
saw an error?).

What if send-pack doesn't send us anything useful (e.g., it hangs up
without sending the report). Shouldn't we take the presence of "err"
being non-zero as an indication that things are not well, even if we
never get to the send-pack report?
