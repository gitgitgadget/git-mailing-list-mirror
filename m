(Just for the list, this message, although written in an unusual style
isn't spam. I've been talking to Cyrus on IRC)

It's great that you want to translate Git into chinese. Currently Git
is in a state where we're preparing to accept translations, but
there's no reason why you can't start now.

What you can do to start now is:

    git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git
    cd git
    make pot
    cd po
    msginit --locale=3Dzh

That'l generate a template zh.po that you can translate. You can
translate the text with any PO editor, e.g. Poedit:
http://www.poedit.net/

Please let me know if you have any questions, or if there's anything
that can be improved in this process.

In particular I was thinking of using some web interface for
translation, but that would probably be hard to work out with
accounting for who did what, which would play badly with Git's signoff
policies.
