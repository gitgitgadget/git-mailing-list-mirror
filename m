Right. That's the mysterious "-1" error code, and I agree that part is
confusing.

I don't think any command should report failure of its _own_ operation
if "gc --auto" failed. And grepping around the source code shows that we
typically ignore it.

What I was trying to say earlier is that we _did_ build this
rate-limiting, and I think it is a bug that the non-daemon case does not
rate-limit (but nobody noticed, because the default is daemonizing).

So the fix is not "rip out the rate-limiting in daemon mode", but rather
"extend it to the non-daemon case".
