I think Git is a really good project and I would like to contribute to it.
I have been having a look to the source and I have realized on that all
code is C(well and perl for some scripts and so..). I know that C++ code
was not welcome sometime ago, but I don't know if this have changed.

I don't feel comfortable programing in C and I prefer C++ only because I
have more experience using this one. May I contribute to this project in
that language?.

Thanks a lot.
