How about http://git-htmldocs.googlecode.com/git/ ?

It's just a directory listing of the git-htmldocs repository that Junio
maintains - the latest update was yesterday: Autogenerated HTML docs for
v1.8.1.2-422-g08c0e.

[I didn't know Google Code let you view the repository like that, but I
got there by clicking the "raw" link against one of the files so I
assume it's not likely to go away.]
