Thanks Oliver for posting an example that we can test, that said I can't
reproduce it on Linux if the hunk is edited correctly. However if I
remove the leading space from the empty line between 'baz' and 'foo'
then I get the same error as you. Perhaps your editor is stripping
trailing white space? If so that will lead to problems when editing
diffs as the leading space is needed for apply to know that it's an
empty context line.

For the mailing list the hunk in question looks like
@@ -1,5 +1,5 @@
 foo
-bar
+bar1
 baz

 foo

I've tried using 'git apply --recount --cached' directly and was
surprised to see that it accepts the patch with the broken context line.
In 2.17.0 'add -p' no longer uses the --recount option, instead it
counts the patch it's self but stops counting when it runs out of lines
starting with [- +], this explains the difference from earlier versions.
It seems it's not uncommon for editors to strip the space from empty
context lines so maybe 'add -p' should take that into account when
recounting patches. I'm about to go off line for a couple of weeks so it
will probably be next month before I'm able to put a patch together
(assuming Junio agrees we should support broken hunks)

Best Wishes

Phillip
