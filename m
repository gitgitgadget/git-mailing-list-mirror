While I agree having a summary of the discussions
that took place on the list is great (and I would
read it), what I would really like is a
'git-users' list.

The traffic here is very developper-oriented and
there isn't much room for casual, beginner-level
discussion on the use of git. A lot of projects
work that way and I think it's a really useful
segregation. And it's really not a lot of work to
setup...

I, for one, don't feel comfortable asking beginner
question here (perhaps wrongly).

My two cents.
