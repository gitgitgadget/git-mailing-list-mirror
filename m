This all makes sense to me, and the patch looks sane.

Coincidentally, we recently set up a docker test build for our local fork
of Git. We found the whole "mount the existing git source tree" strategy
slightly annoying, exactly because of these mismatches between the host
and docker uids.

Instead, we ended up with something more like:

  git archive HEAD | docker run ...

and the in-container script starts with:

  tar -x

to extract the to-be-tested source, and ends with a dump of the failures
to stdout.

I don't know if it's worth switching strategies now, but just some food
for thought. It may be less interesting with Travis, too, because you're
also trying to carry the prove cache across runs, which does require
some filesystem interaction.

(As an aside, I'm not sure the prove cache is doing much. Running in
slow-to-fast order helps if you are trying to run massively in parallel,
but we only use -j3 for our Travis builds).
