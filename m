So, there are two separate issues here:

1) whether beginners should be in a different place from the developers

2) whether a beginners list should be a web forum or just another
   mailing list?

I won't speak to point 1, because I can see both sides of it, but I'll
be adamant about point 2:

   web forums suck

Please, if you're gonna do this, make it a mailing list.  Preferrably some
place that also has an NNTP feed, and a (gack) web view for those who prefer
that.

Why do people insist on reinventing email, badly?
