Hi,

Just went there, because I thought it might be fun to write about my 
newest ideas, and progress on old ones.

But then I read this:

	If you want to have your journal/weblog aggregated here, please 
	send an email to the webmaster with your name, full git-related
	feed and hackergotchi URL.

Up until the "send an email to the webmaster with your name", I was game.

After that: I am probably too stupid, because I do not understand what is 
meant, but even then, I am sure that I no longer want to be part of it.

Ciao,
Dscho
