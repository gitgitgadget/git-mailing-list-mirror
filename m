Also, the organization setup page is asking us "desired number of
projects".

Hmm.  Gee.  We have an entire ideas page full of projects that we'd
desire to have done.  More than we can realistically mentor students
working through (depending on the skill level of the individual
of course).

I'm thinking we ask for 2 or 3 slots, given that we have 6 mentors
lined up right now.

Thoughts?
