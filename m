I really like the idea of being able to send our machine-readable output
in some "standard" syntax for which people may already have parsers. But
one big hangup with JSON is that it assumes all strings are UTF-8. That
may be OK for telemetry data, but it would probably lead to problems for
something like status porcelain, since Git's view of paths is just a
string of bytes (not to mention possible uses elsewhere like author
names, subject lines, etc).

Before we commit to a standardized format, I think we need to work out
a solution there (because I'd much rather not go down this road for
telemetry data only to find that we cannot use the same standardized
format in other parts of Git).

Some possible solutions I can think of:

  1. Ignore the UTF-8 requirement, making a JSON-like output (which I
     think is what your patches do). I'm not sure what problems this
     might cause on the parsing side.

  2. Specially encode non-UTF-8 bits. I'm not familiar enough with JSON
     to know the options here, but my understanding is that numeric
     escapes are just for inserting unicode code points. _Can_ you
     actually transport arbitrary binary data across JSON without
     base64-encoding it (yech)?

  3. Some other similar format. YAML comes to mind. Last time I looked
     (quite a while ago), it seemed insanely complex, but I think you
     could implement only a reasonable subset. OTOH, I think the tools
     ecosystem for parsing JSON (e.g., jq) is much better.

The API generally looks pleasant, but the nesting surprised me.  E.g.,
I'd have expected:

  jw_array_begin(out);
  jw_array_begin(out);
  jw_array_append_int(out, 42);
  jw_array_end(out);
  jw_array_end(out);

to result in an array containing an array containing an integer. But
array_begin() actually resets the strbuf, so you can't build up nested
items like this internally. Ditto for objects within objects. You have
to use two separate strbufs and copy the data an extra time.

To make the above work, I think you'd have to store a little more state.
E.g., the "array_append" functions check "out->len" to see if they need
to add a separating comma. That wouldn't work if we might be part of a
nested array. So I think you'd need a context struct like:

  struct json_writer {
    int first_item;
    struct strbuf out;
  };
  #define JSON_WRITER_INIT { 1, STRBUF_INIT }

to store the state and the output. As a bonus, you could also use it to
store some other sanity checks (e.g., keep a "depth" counter and BUG()
when somebody tries to access the finished strbuf with a hanging-open
object or array).

In general I'd really prefer to keep the shell script as the driver for
the tests, and have t/helper programs just be conduits. E.g., something
like:

  cat >expect <<-\EOF &&
  {"key": "value", "foo": 42}
  EOF
  test-json-writer >actual \
    object_begin \
    object_append_string key value \
    object_append_int foo 42 \
    object_end &&
  test_cmp expect actual

It's a bit tedious (though fairly mechanical) to expose the API in this
way, but it makes it much easier to debug, modify, or add tests later
on (for example, I had to modify the C program to find out that my
append example above wouldn't work).
