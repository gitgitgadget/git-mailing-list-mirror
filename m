Yes, in test-date.o.

Normally a linker would search for new objects to link only when there 
are still symbols to resolve.  If the library is well architected (mind 
you I don't know if that is the case on Windows or OS X) you should find 
many small object files in a library, so to have only related functions 
together in a single object for only the needed code to be linked in the 
final binary. Hence the printf symbol should be in a separate object 
file than gettimeofday, etc.

Only if the library's object file containing gettimeofday also contains 
another symbol pulled by the linker will you see a duplicated symbol 
error.  But this is still a possibility.  So your proposal is probably 
cleaner.
