Do we have interested mentors for the next round of Outreachy?

The deadline for Git to apply to the program is September 5th. The
deadline for mentors to have submitted project descriptions is September
24th. Intern applications would start on October 1st.

If there are mentors who want to participate, I can handle the project
application and can start asking around for funding.
