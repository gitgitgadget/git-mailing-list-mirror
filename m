I read over what is in Google's application system, and it all looks
good.

I did make one minor change, which is that I listed "Software Freedom
Conservancy" as a foundation of which we are a member. I don't think it
will make a difference either way to our application, but they may want
to have it in their system, as it becomes relevant later on for
invoicing the mentor payments.

Matthieu, thanks for coordinating the application effort this year.  And
thanks to everybody else for submitting ideas and microprojects.
