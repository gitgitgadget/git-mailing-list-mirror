There's also scrollback in the terminal, which can be used to show more 
of the contents that was displayed before exiting the pager.

If you didn't select some line or page to be displayed, by scrolling 
within the pager, it obviously isn't going to be displayed, which is the 
whole point of using a pager instead of "spitting" the whole contents 
out at once.

Where and when you exit the pager is up to you only, and you can decide 
what will be left on the screen at that point.

That sounds like some issue with your terminal or terminal emulator, 
which should be debugged and fixed separately.  Such misbehavior isn't 
supposed to happen at all.

It works just fine for me, for example.  You're obviously having some 
unrelated issues with your terminal emulator.

I see.  Actually, removing "-S" was a good decision, IMHO, because 
chopping long lines isn't something that a sane set of defaults should 
do.  Many users would probably be confused with the need to use the 
right arrow to see long lines in their entirety.

Well, "-R" is pretty much mandatory, because coloring the outputs has 
become some kind of defacto standard, and it's very useful when viewing 
diffs, for example.
