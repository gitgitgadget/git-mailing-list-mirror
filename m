LT> I actually just applied (and pushed out) your older versions.

What I prepared and were going to send are just a rediff against
2f97813870c73a89b673ea7882f2a078d25c2dcd which did not have
these three bits, so if you have not forgotten about them then
it's fine.  I'll not re-send them.

No improvements in the meantime but I'll let you know if I see
any problems.
