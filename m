I tried it just now, and it's not that clever. A regular "diff -r" of
the before and after HTML yields what you'd expect:

--- old/git-config.html	2020-04-09 11:38:19.312436125 -0400
+++ new/git-config.html	2020-04-09 11:38:40.028385850 -0400

A diffoscope diff yields the same, plus it complains about differing
timestamps on all of the files. I don't think it's doing anything clever
with respect to HTML formatting.
