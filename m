Why do you think noone else did it? There are several user pages:

    https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php?title=Special:AllPages&namespace=2

and the deletion log suggests that other users are having their user
pages deleted, including Jakub Narebski (a list regular):

    https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Special:Log/delete

It's not like he had much of a chance to do so, being banned within a
day.

I don't know what exactly went down here (the pages have been deleted,
and I'm not a sysop on the wiki). But from the discussion in this
thread User:Dscho seems to be an out of control admin. A user:

    1. Created an account & Added a user page
    2. Had the user page deleted as "link spam" (I'll grant him that,
       it's somewhat spammy behavior with no other contributions.
    3. Was banned when asking the admin on the admin's user page what
       was wrong, the admin subsequently deleting his user talk page.

#3 could easily have been handled by explaining that the git wiki
doesn't use user pages like other wikis, and that adding one with a
link to your blog looks spamming, not by banning the user right away.

And as an aside, it's relatively easy to configure MediaWiki not to
use user pages (or at least, not to make them visible anywhere).

If the admins at the Git wiki really don't want user pages there doing
that would reduce a lot of friction in the future.

Users create these pages out of habit when using MediaWiki because the
software and most MediaWiki installations encourage it.
