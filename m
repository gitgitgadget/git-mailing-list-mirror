I had considered that initially, but it's a little less flexible if a
caller doesn't actually have an oid. Though both of the proposed callers
do, so it's probably OK to worry about that if and when it ever comes up
(the most plausible thing in my mind is doing some abbrev-like analysis
without looking to abbreviate a _particular_ oid).

Yeah.

I actually wrote it that way initially, but doing the hashcpy() in the
caller is a bit more awkward. My thought was to punt on that until the
rest of the surrounding code starts handling oids.

This patch looks sane. How do you want to handle it? I'd assumed your
earlier one would be for applying on top, but this one doesn't have a
commit message. Did you want me to squash down the individual hunks?
