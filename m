I was coincidentally looking at this the other day also noticed these.
Thanks for cleaning it up (and your patch looks obviously correct).

I also found it funny that we read the whole input into a buffer and
parse from there, rather than using strbuf_getline(). But that's
intentional due to e23d84350a (update-ref --stdin: read the whole input
at once, 2014-04-07). I think the line-oriented protocol actually can be
easily read like that, but the "-z" format ends up having to do awkward
reads.

Anyway, sort of a tangent, but I didn't want anybody else looking at
this having to dig down the same hole I did. ;)
