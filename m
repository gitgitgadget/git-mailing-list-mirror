In general, not clearing the screen (i.e. "-X") is there so the 
displayed contents is still visible in the terminal after exiting the 
pager.  That wouldn't be the case if the screen was cleared, making it 
less usable for most users.

Exiting if less contents than one full screen was displayed (i.e. "-F") 
is there to save people from the frustration of quitting a pager that 
actually wasn't needed to be executed.

When it comes to "-R", it has to be there, otherwise no coloring of the 
paginated output could be possible.
