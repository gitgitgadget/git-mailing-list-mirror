Thanks for posting this.

I know Shawn has not been all that active on this list in the past few
years, so many may not know how active he has been behind the scenes:

 - serving on the Git project leadership committee

 - managing many of the contributors whose names you see here daily

 - working on other Git ecosystem projects that aren't on this list
   (like JGit!)

Over the many years, I've found him consistently smart, hard-working,
funny, and just overall pleasant to work with. I'll miss him.
