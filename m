Hrm... this tutorial is exactly like cogito's own readme as far as I'm
concerned : it just makes things even more confusing to me. I must be
really stupid, I should stick to hacking the kernel and not try to use
userland tools :)

Anyway, can you explain what it is all about this branch thing ?

I don't understand why in hell you would want linux-2.6 to be a branch
of cogito itself ... 

Ben.
