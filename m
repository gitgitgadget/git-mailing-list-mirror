Yeah, I think it would be nice to use that, too, if it works everywhere.
The last discussion of this was from 2017, where peple likewise seemed
in favor:

  https://lore.kernel.org/git/xmqqlgnrq9qi.fsf@gitster.mtv.corp.google.com/

There was even a weather balloon patch:

  https://lore.kernel.org/git/20170719181956.15845-1-sbeller@google.com/

but it got hung up on somebody using gcc 4.8. ;)

It looks like the default flavor bumped to gnu90 in gcc 5. That came out
in 2015, but the last 4.x release was in August 2016. Which is getting
old-ish, but still well within the realm of what people may be using an
on older distro (e.g., RHEL7, which is still supported).

For gcc, at least, this is trivially fixable with a `-std` flag (though
it may be tricky to make it work out-of-the-box through the Makefile). I
don't think we'll know if there problems with other compilers until we
do the weather balloon.
