Hi,

I wonder if there was a secret alien invasion three days ago, with an evil 
mental virus weapon?  It seems that this question has been asked three 
times in the last three days, twice on IRC, and once here.

So now, I really, really, really, (repeat that 97 more times in your head, 
please) want to know why?

There must be some super uber-cool application of that, that people 
_insist_ on having it.  And I do not want to be left out.  Please tell me 
how I could use that feature to make my workflow better.

Please, please, please.

Ciao,
Dscho

P.S.: I know how to do it, too.  And no, it does not help to try insulting 
me (unsuccessfully), even in a private chat.
