GitHub announces new maintainer for Git

GitHub is proud to announce the replacement of the old Git maintainer =20
with the "Git Core Team", comprising PJ Hyett, Scott Chacon, Tom =20
Preston and some select personalities from the Ruby on Rails world. =20
You'll be able to track all the latest updates to "Git Edge" over at =20
GitHub. The former maintainer, Junio C Hamano, is being retired from =20
service because the Git community (see git-scm.com) decided he wasn't =20
as good-looking as David Heinemeier Hanson. For more information, see =20
the official Git book (book.git-scm.com).
