Most people do not use same editors. In our office there's 8 programmers

If topgit had 4374 contributors since 10 minor versions back, I'd be
more inclined to agree with you. Even so, you'll have to accept that
this patch gets dropped[1] and stop trying to argue for it after it's
already been discussed (at length).

seem to be against this patch.
