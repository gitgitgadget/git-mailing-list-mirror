The only potential problem with it is that some MUA's (like mutt for
example) sort by the From date by default.  You can force it to list
the patches in an unsorted order (via 'Ou'), but it might be nice if
the patches date in the From field was the date that the patches were
generated, with the seconds field bumped so that the patches in a
series were guaranteed to have monotonically increasing dates.  It's
only a minor point, though.
