Let's put it in the commit message. I think that it's useful enough that
people interested enough to dig through the commits would want it, but
too detailed to be as visible as in the technical documentation.

I'm sorry to give off the impression that I do not want to help; that's
not the case. After reading GÃ bor's email, I thought that the changes he
was suggesting were minor, and was trying to say "let's do this on top
and apply the important bug fixes first," not, "I am never going to
touch this again".

It looks off to a great start; and thanks for taking the care to make up
for my laziness. Everything you did looks good to me. I touched up
"bloom: encode out-of-bounds filters as non-empty" locally to include
the table above (and some commentary around it), so I'll send a v3 to
the list once I have finished running the tests.

Thank you, and sorry again.

Thanks,
