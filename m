Subject: [PATCH 0/18] alternate object database cleanups

This series is the result of RenÃ© nerd-sniping me with the claim that we
could "easily" teach count-objects to print out the list of alternates
in:

  http://public-inbox.org/git/c27dc1a4-3c7a-2866-d9d8-f5d3eb161650@web.de/

My real goal is just patch 17, which is needed for the quarantine series
in that thread. But along the way there were quite a few opportunities
for cleanups along with a few minor bugfixes (in patches 7 and 18), and
I think the count-objects change in patch 16 is a nice general debugging
tool.

The rest of it is "just" cleanup, but I'll note that it clears up some
hairy allocation code. These were bits that I noticed in my big
allocation-cleanup series last year, but were too nasty to fit any of
the more general fixes. I think the end result is much better.

The number of patches is a little intimidating, but I tried hard to
break the refactoring down into a sequence of obviously-correct steps.
You can be the judge of my success.
