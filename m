  Hello,

  today, I will be upgrading the machine with Git Wiki and repo.or.cz
to Debian Lenny, and then upgrading the repo.or.cz infrastructure to the
new more user-friendly version (that I finished about half a year ago
:/).

  Thus, the Wiki may not be available for several hours from about
13:00 UCT today. The repo.or.cz mirroring will be stopped for most of
the day, the administrative interface will experience some
yet-unestimated outage, the web interface, git daemon and pushing
service should stay available most of the time.

  Sorry for the short notice!
