I really like this direction. The slowness of coccicheck is one of the
things that has prevented me from running it more frequently. And I'm a
big fan of breaking steps down as much as possible into make targets. It
lets make do its job (avoiding repeated work and parallelizing).

On a 40-core (20+20) machine, doing "make -j40 coccicheck" from scratch
went from:

  real	1m25.520s
  user	5m41.492s
  sys	0m26.776s

to:

  real	0m24.300s
  user	14m35.084s
  sys	0m50.108s

I was surprised by the jump in CPU times. Doing "make -j1 coccicheck"
with your patch results in:

  real	5m34.887s
  user	5m5.620s
  sys	0m19.908s

so it's really the parallelizing that seems to be to blame (possibly
because this CPU boosts from 2.3Ghz to 3.0Ghz, and we're only using 8
threads in the first example).

IMHO this is not really that big a deal. We are doing useful work for
each line, so to me it's just more eye candy (and it's really satisfying
to watch it zip by on the 40-core machine ;) ).

What if we inverted the current loop? That is, right now we iterate over
the cocci patches at the Makefile level, and then for each target we
iterate over the giant list of source files. Instead, we could teach the
Makefile to iterate over the source files, with a target for each, and
then hit each cocci patch inside there.

That would give roughly the same output as a normal build. But moreover,
I wonder if we could make things faster by actually combining the cocci
files into a single set of rules to be applied to each source file. That
would mean invoking spatch 1/8 as much. It does give fewer opportunities
for "make" to reuse work, but that only matters when the cocci files
change (which is much less frequent than source files changing).

Doing:

  cat contrib/coccinelle/*.cocci >mega.cocci
  make -j40 coccicheck COCCI_SEM_PATCHES=mega.cocci

gives me:

  real	0m17.573s
  user	10m56.724s
  sys	0m11.548s

And that should show an improvement on more normal-sized systems, too,
because we really are eliminating some of the startup overhead.

The other obvious downside is that you don't get individual patches for
each class of transformation. Do we care? Certainly for a routine "make
coccicheck" I primarily want to know:

  - is there something that needs fixing?

  - give me the patch for all fixes

So I wonder if we'd want to have that be the default, and then perhaps
optionally give some targets to let people run single scripts (or not;
they could probably just run spatch themselves).

Doing the "one big .cocci" would help with this, too (and again puts us
in the same ballpark as a compile).

I looked into this a long time ago for another set of Makefile patches I
was considering. $(eval) was added to GNU make in 3.80, released in
2002. Which is probably fine by now.

If it isn't, one more exotic option would be to push the coccicheck
stuff into its own Makefile, and just run it via recursive make. Then
anybody doing a vanilla build can do so even with an antique make, but
you could only "make coccicheck" with something from the last 16 years
(but good luck getting ocaml running there).

I suspect if we go with the one-spatch-per-source route, though, that we
could do this just with regular make rules.
