The conversion looks correct to me and is certainly an improvement.

I was about to comment on this in the patch, but your explanation
preempted me. :) The logic here makes sense.

In general, parsing subsections accurately involves looking from both
the start and the end of the string, pulling out the section and key and
leaving the rest in the middle. But I think we can get away with this
left-to-right parsing because we're only interested in matching a
_specific_ subsection name, and a specific key. So there are no cases it
will handle incorrectly.

The more general form would be:

  const char *subsection, *key;
  int subsection_len;

  if (!parse_config_key("branch", &subsection, &subsection_len, &key) &&
      subsection_len == strlen(branch) && !strncmp(subsection, branch) &&
      !strcmp(key, "mergeoptions"))
         ...

but that's a bit more awkward (it would be less so if we had a helper
function for comparing a NUL-terminated string against a ptr/len pair).
