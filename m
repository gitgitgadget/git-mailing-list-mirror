Yes, right. However, do you think it is reasonable to complete remote
refnames? I don't think so, because it would mean we would have to run
ls-remote during completion -- and waiting for ls-remote could be quite
lengthy.

My line of thought is the following:

--quiet: does not print anything and is therefore only useful for
scripting. Thus, there is no need to have it on the command line completion.

--exit-code: has no visible effect and is only useful for scripting.

--upload-pack: is really exotic. Nobody will ever use it without digging
deep in the manuals. Therefore, I think it's unnecessary to have the
option completable.


--symref: Should probably be added, thanks.

However, if you don't find my reasoning for omitting the three options
above conclusive, I have no problem including them.
