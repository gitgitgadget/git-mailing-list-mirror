Because when I do:

   # sometimes I forgot that refs are not good...
   $ echo HEAD | git commit-graph write --stdin-commits

then I get _nothing_: neither an error, nor a commit-graph.

Oh, no :)

Or introduce 'git commit-graph write --stdin-refs'?  Or teach
'--stdin-commits' to DWIM and accept and parse refs?  Though the
question still remains what to do with refs that can't be peeled back
to commits
