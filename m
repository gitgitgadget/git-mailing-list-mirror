To me it's as much about documenting the assumptions as it is about
catching buggy callers. I'd be OK with a comment, too.

Using unsigned makes sense. Using "char" because you know it only goes
to 256 is a bit too subtle for my taste. And yes, I'd do it in a
preparatory patch (or follow-on if you prefer).

Yeah, this is what I had in mind.

One side effect of the original code is that this trailing setlen()
would catch any early-exits from for_each_file_in_obj_subdir() which
forgot to reset the strbuf. If any exist, that's a bug that should be in
fixed in that function, though. I double-checked, and there aren't any
(your patch already handles the extra setlen required when opendir
fails).
