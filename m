Yes, this is well known.  So is a line that begins with "diff --git"
makes mailinfo to guess that it is the end of the log message.

Whatever message you write format-patch emits without escaping, so
"patch was generated by format-patch" does not guarantee anything,
unfortunately.  A related similar issue is that a line that begins
with "From " may be corrupted into a line that begins with ">From "
by the time the message hits your mailbox.  These are unfortunately
something you have to know and long-time users learned to avoid
doing so unconsciously ;-).
