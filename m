Dearest One,

  Good day!

I am interested in establishing and operating a very viable business as a
means of investment abroad with the Sum of US $ 9,500,000.00 I inherited
from my Father which he deposited in Bahamas.

My preference is any good profit yielding businesses you will suggest. My
need for this business proposition is very urgent as I am planning to move
out of my country and ensure that the money is invested profitably since
it is my only and last hope of survival since I lost my Parents and entire
Family due to the political crisis that engulfed my country.

I await your prompt and urgent response for more details.

Yours Respectfully,

JAQUES Gilbout.
