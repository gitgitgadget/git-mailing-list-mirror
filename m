UTSL, it's all open source ;-)

It is generated by the toolchain I check out in Meta/ directory from the
'todo' branch of git.git.  Of interest would be

 - git-topic.perl -- this lists the topics with their doneness.  It
   unfortunately heavily depends on my workflow to have one stable
   ('next') and one wilder ('pu') test integration branches, and
   convention to name the topics as ??/?*.

 - WC -- this produces and helps me maintain "What's cooking".  It calls
   git-topic.perl to generate the list, and optionally calls UWC to merge
   the new one with the previous issue.

 - UWC -- this reads the last issue of "What's cooking", and uses the
   output from git-topic.perl to update it.  It primarily is needed
   because the order topics are output from git-topic.perl is different
   from how I want to have them listed in "What's cooking", and reads the
   last issue to classify each topics into the same category as they
   appeared in it.

 - WI -- this gives "What's in" and should be straightforward.
