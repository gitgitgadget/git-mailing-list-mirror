Thanks. I will use both of these suggestions verbatim.

Absolutely. This stems from my earlier assumption that the sparse index
was required, but it is not. I have reworded locally.

Thanks for these numbers! Are you willing to keep that example repo

I have reworded in a slightly different way, but with the same meaning
as you provide here.

You're right. My use of "sparse file" or "sparse directory" was intended
to mean "a path from a cache entry with SKIP_WORKTREE that is either a
blob or tree" but that isn't necessary here.

Instead, I'll focus my attention on paths being passed to path_found(),
which removes the context of an index. The danger there is that the
caching assumes that we are moving through the paths in an order such
as in the index, but that's a natural type of ordering for paths.

Excellent. Thanks for recognizing this pattern and recommending a
simplification.

No, you understood correctly. Thanks for the further simplification and
speed improvement.

Thanks for your detailed review. I'll put these updates into a v2 and
send it later today. I need to retest in my monorepo example and add
your publicly-available example before v2 will be ready.

Thanks,
