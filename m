Ah, sorry to introduce confusion. I mostly meant "if we need to cast,
why not just define as unsigned in the first place?". But I think Ren√©
was pointing out that we do not even need to cast, and I am fine with
that approach.

I do dream of a world where we do not have a bunch of implicit
conversions (both signedness but also truncation) in our code base, and
can compile cleanly with -Wconversion We know that this case is
perfectly fine, but I am sure there are many that are not. However, I'm
not sure if we'll ever get there, and in the meantime I don't think it's
worth worrying too much about individual cases like this.
