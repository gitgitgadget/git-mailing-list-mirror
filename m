I've asked this on IRC a couple times and nobody seemed to have a good 
answer, so: These two tools seem like they are solving the same general 
problem using similar approaches. They are both under active 
development. In what areas is each of them stronger than the other? Why 
would one choose to use one of them instead of the other?
