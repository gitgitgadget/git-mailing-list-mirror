It's both. GIT_PAGER_IN_USE tells Git not to bother checking isatty(),
and then TERM=vt100 is necessary to override test-lib's TERM=dumb
specifically for the color code.

Hmm. I have mixed feelings on this. I do like the simplicity of avoiding
test_terminal (which is unportable and has also contributed to some
confusing behavior in the past[1]). But it also takes us further away from
a real-world setup.

That might be OK for the tests you quoted above, if we're OK with
assuming the equivalence of isatty() and GIT_PAGER_IN_USE for the color
code (though we'd probably want to make sure that's tested _somewhere_).

But it obviously would not work for test-terminal callers that are
checking the pager behavior. And I suspect it may create other oddities;
e.g., a script which calls a sub-command that looks at GIT_PAGER_IN_USE,
even though the sub-command's output is going to a pipe. Though one
could argue that's a bug[2] (that could be triggered by _actually_
sending the script's output to pager).

If we're going to get rid of test-terminal.pl (and I would be happy
enough to see it go), I'd rather we mock things up at the isatty()
level, something like what I showed in:

  https://lore.kernel.org/git/20190524062724.GC25694@sigill.intra.peff.net/

That gives us a more realistic setup, and we could reliably use it
everywhere that test-terminal is used.

[1] I had issues a while back with test-terminal's stdin feature being
    racy:

      https://lore.kernel.org/git/20190520125016.GA13474@sigill.intra.peff.net/

[2] Long ago I had a patch to make PAGER_IN_USE more careful by making
    sure that our pipe is the same as the pager pipe. It did (and does)
    work, but it would need some portability adjustments. I never
    bothered to follow up because it really does seem to be a pretty
    unlikely setup in practice. But if you're curious:
