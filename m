It's hard to say without seeing a full example. The merge machinery is
supposed to handle this situation (and indeed, in a simple reproduction
example it does). So presumably it thinks the other side may have
touched those files for some reason. Perhaps it's confused by rename
detection?

Is it possible to give us a more complete example, including:

  - a url for the repository
  - the commit at HEAD when you ran "git checkout"
  - the {hash} commit from which you rescued the files
  - the state of the remote branch (i.e., what we attempted to merge
    with "git pull")

?
