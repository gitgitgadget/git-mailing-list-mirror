So that being said, I did complete the application. We can still
withdraw if we want before students start applying, or we can put a
disclaimer on the ideas page.

I tweaked the application text to update it for this year, but nothing
too major. The result is at:

  http://git.github.io/SoC-2015-Org-Application.html

That content was cut-and-pasted into Google's application interface.
Matthieu, as backup admin you should have access to tweak that if there
are typos, etc (and I will probably not be available to apply fixes from
now until the deadline, so please do so if you see anything).

We can continue to improve the ideas page as time goes on. At some point
Google will look at as part of the application, but probably not right
at the deadline. :)
