The ce_flags invalidation and the untracked-cache invalidation are
independent (as far as I could tell) and it doesn't matter which
order we do them.  Moving the UC to the start of the function was
an attempt to avoid the usual "goto the bottom" or the need to guard
against early "return" statements that were present in some of the
original code (or my various refactorings).  Moving it to the top
just let me get it out of the way and not have to contrive things.

I'll update the commit message.

Thanks
Jeff
