Yeah, I agree that the is potentially problematic: it's a circular
dependency, plus updating tags is awkward, per Ã†var's other message.

Perhaps we should replace it with instructions on getting the key?

I tried a blind "gpg --recv-keys" and came up with an old version ("not
changed" according to GPG). That hits keys.openpgp.org by default. A lot
of the keyservers used to peer with each other, but I've heard that
there's less of that these days due to key-spamming attacks (but it's
not really something I keep up with).

I admit that I never actually verify git.git's tags anyway (why would I?
I'm fetching unsigned branch tips from your repo constantly anyway). I
only noticed because I was looking fora bug in "git tag -verify
--format". :)
