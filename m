Hi all,

We've just released GitJungle
(http://www.plasticscm.com/labs/gitjungle.aspx), a git branch explorer
based on the same codebase we use in our version control product,
plastic scm.

We wanted to call it something like GitForest (you know, so many
branches and trees :P) but the name was already reserved...

GitJungle is a beta and works on Linux, Mac and Windows and basically
we'd love to get feedback. The drawing approach we use is a little bit
different from what other git tools are using: we draw horizontally
instead of vertically, we think it is a better way but, you know, it is
probably a matter of preference.

I'd really like if you could give it a try and of course any feedback
(including tough critics) will be more than welcome.

Thanks,

pablo
