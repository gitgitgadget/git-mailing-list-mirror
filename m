Me either, I very much welcome your consistently thoughtful replies
(even if my extreme delay in responding to this one would suggest
otherwise... ;)).

Yeah, I think that the most reasonable behavior is definitely that we
should complain about non-existent objects over 'git commit-graph write
--stdin-commits' no matter if '--[no-]check-oids' is given or not.

But, let's step back for a minute. What are we actually hoping to
accomplish with '--check-oids'? I wrote this patch because I wanted a
way to support 'git for-each-ref' piping into 'git commit-graph write'
without having to juggle which tags peel down to commits and which
don't.

Now, I figured that it would be unreasonable to change the default
behavior of 'git commit-graph write --stdin-commits' (which is to
complain and error out in this circumstance), so I added
'--no-check-oids' as a way to avoid that behavior for callers that want
that.

But, are there ever any callers that *wouldn't* want this behavior? As
far as I can tell, probably not. We're only going to be permitting
*more* inputs to 'git commit-graph write', and I seriously doubt that
anybody is depending on the above behavior. (Of course, if that's not
the case, I'd love for somebody to speak up here and we can continue
the course on this patch).

So, I propose the following:

  * We drop the idea of '--[no-]{check,verify}-oids', and always
    silently ignore non-commit inputs, retaining the existing behavior
    of always complaining about things that aren't valid hex OIDs, such
    as "HEAD".

  * We always error out on missing or corrupt commit OIDs, including
    valid OIDs that don't resolve to any object, or resolve to a tag
    that can't be fully peeled.

Does that seem reasonable?
