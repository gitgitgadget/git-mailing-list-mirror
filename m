That's interesting, it shows that different variants were used in the
very early days of email.  Maybe even the all-lowercase "cc" and "bcc"
variants were used somewhere, at least because RFC2076 (better said,
the RFCs that predate it) specifies them.

Thanks for the correction.  You're right, I was lazy enough not to
check that blind carbon copies predate the age of email. [1]

I'm also old enough to remember the literal carbon copies, I even made
a few dozens of them myself on a mechanical typewriter.  They usually
left me with dirty fingertips. :)  Though, I'm also not old enough to
know what the common office practice was like back then.

Exactly, it was the limitation of mechanical typewriters.  Perhaps the
limit was around four or five carbon copies.
