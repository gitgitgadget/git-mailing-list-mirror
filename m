No, I mean that people are lazy when writing online and for an audience 
that broadly share the same sort of text-digesting mind, so they don't 
bother with the dots.

Why not? Both are examples of one-letter-per-word abbreviations.

True, but both forms are common enough. I guess I'm one of the lazier 
ones, since I regularly use lower-case.

I fail to see why not. I also fail to care very much, so feel free not 
to respond. ;)

This is most likely the best solution as it's easier for foreign readers 
with limited proficiency in reading english and english abbreviations 
borrowed from latin, as they don't make sense if you try to put in 
english words matching the abbreviation, dots or no dots.  This gave me 
quite a headache when I was twelve and tried to install Linux for the 
first time :)
