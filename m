I notice that your "add" and "check-ignore" commands differ in the case
of "UI". I think both commands should work correctly when on a
case-insensitive filesystem (and a few checks I did after setting
core.ignorecase manually seem to confirm this).

But maybe try it with "ui" in the check-ignore command and see if that
changes anything?

Another thing I notice is that you're using Windows-style back-slashes
for the path separators (whereas internally in Git, everything is
front-slashes). AFAIK that's supposed to work everywhere on Windows, but
I wouldn't be surprised if there are corner cases where it doesn't. Does
switching to:

  git check-ignore ./Source/ui/Website/LiveFeeds/Releases/IO/ReleasesSerializer.cs

help?
