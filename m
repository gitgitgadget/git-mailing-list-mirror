Yeah, but yours show the SKIP cases, too, i.e. when the whole test is
skipped by:

  if check-something
  then
        skip_all="no can do"
        test_done
  fi

I didn't bother with that because in those cases the prereq is not
denoted by a single word, but rather by a human-readable phrase, and
becase 'prove' runs those skipped test scripts at last when running
slowest first, so I could already see them anyway.

The problem with those files is that a successful 'make test'
automatically and unconditionally removes the whole 'test-results'
directory at the end.  So a separate and optional 'make test ; make
show-missed-prereqs' wouldn't have worked, that's why I did it this
way.

I think it would be better if we kept the 'test-results' directory
even after a successful 'make test', there are some interesting things
to be found there:

Are they aware of the issue?

  https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-users/2017-January/057451.html

suggests to put the socket in '/var/run/user/$(id -u)', but that's for
the "regular" use case, and we should take extra steps to prevent the
tests' gpg from interfering with the gpg of the user running the
tests.  Not sure it would work on macOS.  And ultimately it's not much
different from your GIT_TEST_GNUPGHOME_ROOT suggestion.

Then I stumbled on these patches patches:

  https://lists.zx2c4.com/pipermail/password-store/2017-May/002932.html

suggesting that at least one other project is working around this
issue instead of waiting for upstream to come up with something.

Well, a comment could help others to not waste time on figuring out
this "path is too long for a unix domains socket" issue...  but now
they will be able to find this thread in the list archives as well :)



On a related note: did you happen to notice occasional failures with
gpg2 on Fedora builds?  I observed some lately in tests like
'./t7004-tag.sh' or 't7030-verify-tag.sh' on the Travis CI macOS
builds: it appears as if the gpg process were to die mid-verification.
Couldn't make any sense of it yet, though didn't tried particularly
hard either.
