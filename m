So that's really weird and counter-intuitive, since we should be doing
strictly less work. I know that spatch tries to parallelize itself,
though from my tests, 1.0.4 does not. I wonder if the version in Travis
differs in that respect and starts too many threads, and the extra time
is going to contention and context switches.

Have you tried passing "-j1" to spatch? My 1.0.4 does not even recognize
it.

That seems like a pretty unlikely explanation to me, but I am having
trouble coming up with another one.

I guess the other plausible thing is that the extra memory is forcing us
into some slower path. E.g., a hypervisor may even be swapping,
unbeknownst to the child OS, and it gets accounted in the child OS as
"boy, that memory load was really slow", which becomes used CPU.

That actually sounds more credible to me.
