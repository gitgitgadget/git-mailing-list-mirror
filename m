Hello everyone

I'm as new as new can be so please be gentle.

git version 1.5.4.5

I'm following the peepcode tutorial peepcode-015-git.mov

I've created a branch, and now we're trying to use 

rebase to 'watch' the master branch from the new branch.

When I run the rebase command from the other branch 

I get these types of warnings/errors

http://pastie.caboo.se/192951

Can someone explain to me what's happening here and if I 

should be worried about it?

If I should be worried about it

can anyone point me in the direction of some 

documentation of a good (easy)way

to remove the whitespace?

Thanks everyone.

PS, I do check the archives and found this from yesterday

http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/76650/focus=81336

Does that mean that if I update my git this problem will be resolved?

Sorry for being so naive, I wont be for long (hopefully)
