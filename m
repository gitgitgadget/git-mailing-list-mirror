Perhaps we could say so more explicitly in the v2 protocol spec. I'll
take a look.

You're the second person to complain about this if-else chain. I'll take
the hint. ;)

Hmm. At first I liked this, because it reduces the number of cases (and
variables!). But there's something really subtle going on here. I
thought at first it should be "<", but you are intentionally
over-allocating by one entry to indicate the overflow. I.e., you've
essentially stuffed the too_many_prefixes boolean into the count.

This is far from the parser, but I think that's OK. I'd probably couple
it with a comment explaining why we need to clear rather than using what
we got.

At first I thought this was just being cute, but it's an attempt to
compensate for the off-by-one subtlety in the early check. I'll give it
some thought. I kind of like it, but the fact that it took me a minute
or three to be sure the code is correct makes me worried it's being too
clever.
