We could also drop xmlto for the asciidoctor codepaths, without making
it the default. That requires a little bit more Makefile massaging, but
here's a hacky way to do it (this is on top of brian's asciidoctor 2
patch, which I've been experimenting with, but obviously we could skip
that entirely, too):

That's enough to let you do:

  ./doc-diff --from-asciidoc --to-asciidoctor HEAD^ HEAD

and see what jumping to direct-manpage generation would look like. After
applying all of your recent patches, I see some improvements. E.g.:

  -           Files to add content from. Fileglobs (e.g.  *.c) can be given to

There's also a lot of noise. One curiosity is that it refuses to break

I think that's fine (and probably even better), but it makes the
doc-diff quite hard to read. ;) Setting MANWIDTH=1000 in doc-diff is a
hacky way to eliminate these, but I'm not sure it's a good idea in
general.
