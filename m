This will generate output showing both the unsorted and sorted
differences. Do we want to suppress the sorted ones (e.g., by just using
"cmp" directly)? I guess it doesn't matter unless there is an actual
test failure, but I just wonder if it would be confusing to see both.

This took some head-scratching, mostly because of the original comment.
I thought the "before" here was referring to a timing issue (maybe
because we're talking about timing ;) ).

But it is really "make sure that a failed test here does not prevent us
from doing this cleanup". So the original really should have just
dropped that comment and added a test_when_finished. Bumping it into a
separate test as you have here accomplishes the same thing.
