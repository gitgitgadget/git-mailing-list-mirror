Yes, I can mostly follow you there with one exception: In the cloned
repository the branches are not available under the same name as in the
original repository (unless I'm totally confused). Therefore a beginner would
simply assume "they are missing".
I knew that (which was my use case) git optimizes local copies by linking as
much as possible, but I don't understand why cloned branches are "soooo
complicated". (I could understand it as an optimization for network copies)

Maybe confirm this: At this state I could "checkout test-branch" (for
example), but I could not "merge test-branch", right?
(Another level of confusion is bash-completion which does not know those
hidden branches)

OK, reading git-clone again, the following might apply:
Explain (or refer to) what a "remote-tracking branch" is.

"checks out an initial branch that is forked from the cloned repositoryâ€™s
currently active branch" could be simplified to "checks out the active branch
in the cloned repository"?

Maybe add a paragraph at the end of the DESCRIPTION starting like: "To use
another branch in the clones repository..."

Maybe also add a pointer to the meanings of "origin" and "remote" (I know that
the clone source becomes remote/origin)

I wonder whether "This default configuration is achieved by creating
references to the
remote branch heads under refs/remotes/origin and by initializing
remote.origin.url and remote.origin.fetch configuration variables." should
become "The original repository's URL will be visible as remote/origin in the
cloned reporitory"

Maybe point out the differences between a "default clone" mand a "--mirror
clone" in the DESCRIPTION.

The example "Clone from upstream while borrowing from an existing local
directory:" could benefit from a few explaining words (why would one want to do
that, i.e. what's the effect?)

None of the examples refers to using another branch than the default branch.
Maybe add two examples:
1: checking out a different branch, 2:merging a different branch to the
current one

That's what I think.

Regards,
Ulrich
