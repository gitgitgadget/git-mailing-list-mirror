Well if I do say:
$ reset
$ git diff HEAD~10

and from there scroll down a bit and then q to exit less (and the
screen is not cleared), I see the output only so far as I've had
previously scrolled down in less.

Everything that would have come after that is of course not visible.
The place where I exited may be some "well defined" border, like the
end of a commit... or anywhere it the middle of a patch (making the
left over remains on the terminal perhaps even ambiguous).

What's worse, when (in less) I scroll down and up again, perhaps
repeating several times, and then quit... I see (at least in my
less/terminal combination) things twice and mangled up (i.e. when I
scroll up the terminal (outside of less)).

So AFAICS, not clearing the screen only works properly when never
scrolling up again (in less).

No :-) As I've said, I like it that way and I and probably everyone
else would be annoyed, if -F was not present.

I just meant that strictly speaking the same reason why "S" was
removed, could be applied to "F" as well.

It is - like -R - not necessary for less to work with git.

But it is, of course, what virtually everyone will want in practise.

The main reason I want it is, that things don't get messy, when I
forget being in less and mouse scroll. ;-)


Thanks,
Chris.
