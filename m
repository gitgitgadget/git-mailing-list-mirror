Yes, that's exactly what I had in mind. Usually our clear() functions
put the struct back into some default state from which it can be used
gain. But the state after clear() here (without the patch below) is
something that nobody is ever expected to look at.

Granted, the only function which fills it in is read_...(), and it sets
those defaults itself. But it just seems to me if we're going to have to
put _something_ in the struct to initialize or clear it, it might as
well be those.

As with many parts of Git, there really isn't a clear promise. :) I
don't think you're wrong at all about the current state of things. I'm
mostly basing my comments on "what would I _expect_ the promise to be
based on our general patterns". If that's far from what we promise now,
then it's a hassle to convert. But I think it's actually pretty close.

I'm not too worried about that personally. I think the more likely
problem is that the API is misunderstood and misused. ;)

I'd think this would _always_ be sha-1. Because it's not about "what's
the default for this program running". It's about "what have I read from
this on-disk repo config". And the rule there is "if they don't say
otherwise, it is sha1". That won't change even in a sha256 world,
because we'll maintain backwards-compatibility with legacy repositories
forever.

Now if your next question is: "does any caller misuse this as more than
looking at the repo format", I don't know the answer for sure. That
would be worth poking at (or perhaps having just poked yourself, you
might have an idea already).

I think clear() should always throw everything away. Saving partial bits
from the error path of read() is harder. My gut says "no", but I agree
that's a trickier question. I think the real-world thing here is: we're
reading repo config and see an extensions.* field that says "use
sha256". But then we encounter an error, or don't otherwise have a
version. What do we do?

If that's an undefined setup (and I think it is -- if you're using
extensions.* you're supposed to always set the version field), then I
don't know that it really matters that much. But throwing the whole
thing away (even if it means a buggy code path is more likely to use
sha1) seems OK to me.

For the record, I can live with it either way. There are so many funky
little setup corner cases in the code already, and we don't even really
have a real-world case to dissect at this point. So the right thing may
also just be to finish this patch series as quickly as possible and move
on to something more useful. :)
