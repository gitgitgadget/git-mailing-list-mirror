Good call. I can reproduce those results, too ("1 << 20" gives me a 12%
overall speedup). I'm surprised the growth isn't aggressive enough for
this early expansion to get lost in the noise.

Our hashmap.c implementation gets around this by letting the equality
function take an extra parameter. It's annoying when you're writing
those functions, but it should allow this case without any casting (or
preemptively allocating a struct).

I think the invalidation is pretty infrequent. It only gets called by
end_packfile() when there are few enough objects to loosen them. So
usually that would only happen once per process. You can also trigger it
manually with a "checkpoint" command, but if you're checkpointing often
enough to dump loose objects, I suspect you have other performance
problems.
