OSCON is coming up soon (the week of the 20th) in Portland, and I want
to let people know that there's going to be a small Git table in the
exhibit hall, connected to the GitHub booth. I'll be manning the table
both days (Wednesday and Thursday the 22nd and 23rd), telling people
about how great git is and tricking^W convincing them to become git
contributors.

If you're a git contributor and you feel like hanging out at the table
with me for a bit and preaching the gospel, please come by! If you're a
fan of git, come by and we can chat about new features. And if you're
not a fan of git, come by and throw rotten tomatoes at me!
