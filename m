Dear diary, on Tue, Sep 20, 2005 at 04:31:58AM CEST, I got a letter
where Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org> told me that...
> Hello!

Hello,

> These are the patches that implement cg-object-id and fix the bugs I
> found in process.  The patches show separate stages of changes.
> Otherwise it would be a huge patch.
> 
> This applies to all patches in the series
> Signed-off-by: Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org>

thanks, all but 6/8 applied. It'd make it easier for me if you included
the signed-off-by line in all the patches though, and it would make more
sense too.

Thanks,

VI has two modes: the one in which it beeps and the one in which
