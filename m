I believe this is the last open thread/discussion on the "midx: add MIDX_PROGRESS
flag" patch series.  

A quick summary of where the discussion stands:

- The patch series currently uses #define for the new MIDX_PROGRESS flag.
- The git codebase uses both #defines and enums for flags.
- The debugger always shows the enum value's name if there is a match, if values
  are OR-ed together there a few possibilities (see discussion above and earlier
  in the thread).
- There are concerns regarding misinterpreting constants that are not a set of
  bits (e.g. "PROGRESS * 3").

Are there any other details I can provide that would help in reaching a
conclusion as to how to proceed?

At this time there are no other MIDX_* flags and so there's always the option
to revisit the best way to handle multiple MIDX_* flags if/when additional
flags are added.

Thanks,
William
