I doubt that doing it in one call matters. It's not like stdio promises
us any atomicity in the first place.

I don't think there is anything wrong with using fscanf here, but it has
enough pitfalls in general that I don't really like its use as a parser
(and the general lack of it in Git's code base seems to agree).

I wonder if this should just read a line (or the whole file) into a
strbuf and parse it there. That would better match our usual style, I
think.

I can live with it either way.

Yeah.
