Thanks, and absolutely no reason to say sorry.  This is a
collective volunteer effort and I believe your effort on the
user's manual so far has already made git much more approachable
to new people.  It's greatly appreciated.

Besides, I made it sound as if -rc1 will be blocked, *waiting*
for these two updates, but it was a mistake; it doesn't have to
wait and documentation updates and polishes can happen anytime
before the final.

And contribution from others on the list, especially from people
with some git virginity still left, to review the user's manual
would be valuable.
