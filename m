A while back I proposed some documentation updates
https://public-inbox.org/git/1437416790-5792-1-git-send-email-philipoakley@iee.org/
regarding what is (should be) allowed in the cc-cmd etc., and at the time
Junio suggested that possible existing uses of the current code would be
abuses. I didn't pursue it further, but it may be useful guidance here as to
potential real world command lines..
