Dunno if it helps, but here is what I came up with somewhere in previous
discussions:

--ff::
--no-ff::
--ff-only::
	When the merge resolves as a fast-forward, only update the
	branch pointer (without creating a merge commit).  When a fast
	forward update is not possible, create a merge commit.  This is
	the default behavior, unless merging an annotated (and possibly
	signed) tag that is not stored in its natural place in
	'refs/tags/' hierarchy, in which case --no-ff is assumed.
+
With --no-ff create a merge commit even when the merge could instead
resolve as a fast-forward.
+
With --ff-only resolve the merge as a fast-forward (never create a merge
commit). When fast-forward is not possible, refuse to merge and exit
with non-zero status.
