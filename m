Well, we could do that too.  But I think we'd want to maybe do that
closer to Mountain View, where the actual summit is taking place,
to cut down on the amount of travelling that the out-of-town folks
have to do.

E.g. you could come up this year, and we'll have maybe 3 or 4 of
our mentors here for the summit.  We could even do a mini-one day
thing at the Google campus.  I could probably get Google to give us a
small conference room or tech talk room for half a day or something.

I don't really know what our community is interested in doing.
So I'm just tossing out ideas and seeing what sticks.  If we don't
do anything, that's fine too.
