Because git is not autotool'ed project. And people protested vehemently
against adding yet another dependency. So from the whole autotools suit=
e
only autoconf is used, and only to generate config.mak.autogen Makefile
configuration, which otherwise would be needed to be generated by hand.

BTW git tries to guess configuration based on uname -a result.

There was also for a little while hand-generated configure script, but
it got abandoned when it appeared that it is hard to be portable (and
autoconf did the work; perhaps too hard but did, not using features
which weren't common but now are in standard, but did), and the fact
that it was possible to have _optional_ autoconf support.

Add to that the fact that people said that ./configure on Cygwin is slo=
w
(can be slow), so they prefer _not_ to run this.


Besides, the fact that some tools suport some feature is not the reason
to add it. You have to look at how often is this feature _used_. For
example you don't need it (you need only DESTDIR support) for creating
RPMS from sources.
