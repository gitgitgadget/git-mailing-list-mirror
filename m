I'd perhaps write:

  `srcref`'s value...

but I'm a little afraid to see how it is handled by the various parsers
(I'd write it because it does look OK in most markdown parsers I've
used).

That said, I think in this case "value of `srcref`" is actually an
improvement to the text (but I wouldn't say the same of the earlier
patches, which feel like they are making things clunkier).
