512 is somewhat arbitrary, but having a maximum size is not.

A commit with many changed paths is very rare. The 512 I picked above is 
enough to cover 99% of commits in each of the repos I sampled when first 
investigating Bloom filters.

When a Bloom filter response says "maybe yes" (in our case, "maybe not 
TREESAME"), then we need to verify that it is correct. In the extreme 
case that every path is changed, then the Bloom filter does nothing but 
add extra work.

These extreme cases are also not unprecedented: in our Azure Repos 
codebase, we were using core.autocrlfÂ  to smudge CRLFs to LFs, but when 
it was time to dogfood VFS for Git, we needed to turn off the smudge 
filter. So, there is one commit that converts every LF to a CRLF in 
every text file. Storing a Bloom filter for those ~250,000 entries would 
take ~256KB for essentially no value. By not storing a filter for this 
commit, we go immediately to the regular TREESAME check, which would 
happen for most pathspecs.

This is all to say: having a maximum size is good. 512 is big enough to 
cover _most_ commits, but not so big that we may store _really_ big filters.

Thanks,
-Stolee
