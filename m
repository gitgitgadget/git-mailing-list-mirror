Not directly, if it only has one line, then $(cat ~/PASSWD | cut -d ':'
-f 1) should work, but I haven't tested it.

You are misunderstanding either how git works or the nomenclature. The
commits all happen locally and need no authentication whatsoever (and
usually you're expected to use a real name and email address). When you
need to authenticate is when yuou push your changes somewhere (a centra=
l
repo, for example). This is where the ~/.netrc file comes into play, as
I mentioned in the reply to your other mail.
