Yeah, it would be nice to do away with this inconsistency entirely. I
don't know if that even causes user-visible behavior changes at this
point, though.

Yeah. I think it's easier to approach it from the tree-entry side, and
say: which spots are not recursive, and could/should they be. Which I
think is where your patch below is going.

That's kind-of good news, in that it lends support to the notion that
basically everything wants to be recursive. But I'd be worried there's a
lingering code path that is not covered in the test suite. Certainly
shipping your BUG() patch would flush it out, but it's not very friendly
to users who do run into it.

I wonder if we can drop it to a warning() and see if anybody reports it.

Or the more-work but more-responsible version: manually trace all of the
pathspec calls to see which code paths might rely on leaving "recursive"
unset.
