This patch series doesn't change the external API in any significant
way. It only wraps it up on a virtualization layer so that a different
reference storage backends can be plugged in.

So as long as people are using plumbing commands to work with references
(rather than reading/writing files under $GIT_DIR directly), they should
notice no difference.

There are only two exceptions that I know of:

1. Users will need to be able to request that a repository use a
non-default reference backend, and (less importantly) inquire about
which reference backend a particular repository is using. Those
facilities will be added when the first non-files reference backend is
added.

2. At least one command (`git pack-refs`) is particular to the files
backend, and won't be needed (at least not in its current form) for
other backends. Conversely, it is conceivable that future reference
backends will require their own "maintenance" commands. Such commands
would be added as they are needed.

If there were operations that other reference backends could do much
more efficiently than the files backend (like, hypothetically, return
all references matching a regular expression without having to iterate
through all references), then it might make sense for performance
reasons to provide commands to access that functionality. But at the
moment I don't know of any such cases.
