(Note that redirections can occur anywhere in the command, i.e. these
are all equivalent: 'echo foo >out', 'echo >out foo' '>out echo foo')

Let me put on my POSIX-lawyer hat for a moment to explain this :)

Long story short: Bash doesn't conform to POSIX in this respect.

So, the Shell Command Language specification section 2.6 Word
Expansions [1] says among many other things the following:

  Tilde expansions, parameter expansions, command substitutions,
  arithmetic expansions, and quote removals that occur within a single
  word expand to a single field. It is only field splitting or
  pathname expansion that can create multiple fields from a single
  word.

Later, in section 2.7 Redirection [2]:

  [...] the word that follows the redirection operator shall be
  subjected to tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command
  substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal. Pathname
  expansion shall not be performed on the word by a non-interactive
  shell; an interactive shell may perform it, but shall do so only
  when the expansion would result in one word.

Note that this "word" is _not_ subject of field splitting, i.e. in a
redirection like

  echo foo >$file

it's not necessary to quote $file, because it will remain a single
field even if it contains spaces.

Most shells I have at hand follow the specs:

  $ for shell in dash mksh ksh ksh93 zsh ; do $shell ./e\ space.sh "output from $shell" ; done
  $ ls -1 output\ from*
  output from dash
  output from ksh
  output from ksh93
  output from mksh
  output from zsh

Bash doesn't:

  $ bash ./e\ space.sh "output from bash"
  ./e space.sh: line 1: $1: ambiguous redirect

And this behaviour is documented in its man page (though the text
calls "word splitting" what the specs call "field splitting"):

  The word following the redirection operator in the following descrip
  tions, unless otherwise noted, is subjected to brace expansion,
  tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, command
  substitution, arithmetic expansion, quote removal, pathname
  expansion, and word splitting.

When run in posix mode, however, even Bash follows the specs:

  $ ls -l /bin/sh
  lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 4 Sep 26 12:04 /bin/sh -> bash
  $ sh ./e\ space.sh "output from bash as sh"
  $ bash --posix ./e\ space.sh "output from bash --posix"
  $ ls -1 output\ from\ bash*
  output from bash as sh
  output from bash --posix

That's why we didn't noticed it yet, not even on macOS, which uses
Bash as /bin/sh.  You have to build Git with 'SHELL_PATH=/bin/bash' to
make t7005 fail because of this issue, and based on the trace that
Alexander showed us it seems that OpenIndiana folks do build Git that
way.

Good.  *throws the POSIX-lawyer hat into the farthest corner*

Having said all that, I didn't omit the quotes in 4362da078e with the
above in mind; in fact I tend to use quotes even when they are
unnecessary (e.g. in variable assignments: var="$1"), because unquoted
variables and command substitutions freak me out before I can think
through whether its safe to omit the quotes or not :)


Sidenote: this test should use the write_script helper to create this
editor script.
