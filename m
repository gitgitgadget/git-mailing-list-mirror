Well, we, in general, don't, but that example mentioned in the commit
message does contain autobiographical elements :)

Depends on the purpose, I guess.  For tracing that is aimed to become
part of in git, definitely.  However, for my own ad-hoc tracing used
to try to make sense of some split-index corner cases, trace_printf()
is perfect.

Nah, please leave trace_printf() alone.

Except for removing keyless trace_printf(), I agree.
