Ack!  Embarrassing RTFM.

While I have your attention, however, I noticed that git am <path>
will apply the list patches generated by format-patch.  The
documentation said something about mbox/maildir directories, which I
actually am not that familiar with.  Is it safe to say that git am
<path> will read the path and apply patches in numerical order?  Does
it allow skipping?

Thanks again,
Tommy Wang
