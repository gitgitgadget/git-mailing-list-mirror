While .gitattributes looks like a better place, it does not have
"exclude" attribute equivalence to .gitignore. If I remember
correctly, the way .gitignore and .gitattributes are implemented makes
it very hard to turn .gitignore into part of .gitattributes
implementation (gitattr checks .gitattributes of current dir first,
then upward to parents, while .gitgnore follows the opposite
direction).

But the other way might be simpler: introduce a new attribute, then
make use of the attribute in exclude code like autogenerated
.gitignore. I don't know. I have not thought through this idea.

But of course you can stay away from those by checking new attributes
in builtin/add.c and refusing to execute if someone wants to add a
file larger than a limit. You can avoid git-add internal business by
checking entries in to-be-written index, at label "finish" in
cmd_add(). This is the simplest way (and getting very close to using
hooks).

Anyway, good luck. Come back with some patches ;-)
