Makes sense.

In my script I just use an arbitrary sequence of ports. That means two
stress runs may stomp on each other, but stress runs tend not to
interfere with regular runs (whereas with your scheme, a stress run of
t5561 is going to stomp on t5562). It probably doesn't matter much
either way, as I tend not to do too much with the machine during a
stress run.

Makes sense. My script just redirects the output to a file, but it
predates --verbose-log.

My script always runs with "-x". I guess it's not that hard to add it if
you want, but it is annoying to finally get a failure after several
minutes only to realize that your are missing some important
information. ;)

Ditto for "-i", which leaves more readable output (you know the
interesting part is at the end of the log), and leaves a trash directory
state that is more likely to be useful for inspecting.

My script also implies "--root". That's not strictly necessary, though I
suspect it is much more likely to catch races when it's run on a ram
disk (simply because it leaves the CPU as the main bottleneck).

If there is a delay, it's actually quite annoying to _not_ wait; you
start doing something in the terminal, and then a bunch of extra test
statuses print at a random time.

OK, this adds a counter for each job number (compared to my script).
Seems helpful.

Hmm. What happens if we see a failure _and_ there's an abort? That's
actually pretty plausible if you see a failure whiz by, and you want to
abort the remaining scripts because they take a long time to run.

If the abort happens first, then the goal is to assume any errors are
due to the abort. But there's a race between the individual jobs reading
$stressfail and the parent signal handler writing it. So you may end up
with "aborted\n5" or similar (after which any other jobs would fail to
match "aborted" and declare themselves failures, as well).  I think my
script probably also has this race, too (it doesn't check the abort case
explicitly, but it would race in checking "test -e fail").

If the fail happens first (which I think is the more likely case), then
the abort handler will overwrite the file with "aborted", and we'll
forget that there was a real failure. This works in my script because of
the symlinking (if a real failure symlinked $fail to a directory, then
the attempt to write "aborted" will just be a noop).

Do we need to loop? Calling "wait" with no arguments should wait for all
children.

In my experience, outputting the failed log saves a step (especially
with "-i"), since seeing the failed test and its output is often
sufficient.

I'm also sad to lose the symlink to the failed trash directory, which
saves cutting and pasting when you have to inspect it. But I guess we
can't rely on symlinks everywhere.
