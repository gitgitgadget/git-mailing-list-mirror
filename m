Genuine Swiss made Role8x repilcas are as close to the real thing 
as a repilca watch can be. Sometimes even the professional jewelers 
are unable to tell the difference from the real Role5x watch.

a repilca watch looks so much alike that only an expert could tell the difference...
And you only pay a fractoin of the price.
