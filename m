Git Merge 2017 is happening on Feb 3rd; there will be a Contributor's
Summit the day before. The details are largely what I wrote earlier in
[1], but here's a recap:

  When: Thursday, Feb 2, 2017. 10am-3pm.
  Where: The Egg[2], Brussels, Belgium
  What: Git nerds having a round-table discussion
  Who: All contributors to git or related projects in the git ecosystem
       are invited; if you're not sure if you qualify, just ask!

Registration for the conference is open, and you need to register
specifically for the Contributor's Summit to attend. There's a special
code for registering for the Contributor's Summit; email me off-list to
get instructions. It works either when registering for the main
conference, or separately. You don't have to attend the main conference
on Friday to come to the Contributor's Summit, but I encourage you to.

As I mentioned before, the content is up to us. So start thinking of
things you'd like to discuss. We can probably organize topics on the
kernel.org wiki (if anybody really wants to start things going, feel
free to start a wiki page).

Let me know if you have any questions.
