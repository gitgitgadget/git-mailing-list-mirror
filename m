I think in theory we should be able to lint _every_ test, even if we're
not running it. After all, the point is that a proper linting runs zero
commands.

That said, it may not be worth the implementation effort. The linting
happens at a pretty low-level, and we've already decided to skip tests
long before then (even for single prereqs, let alone skip_all cases
where we exit the script early).

Yeah, that is a bit funny. For a whole-test skip like this, I think
skip_all is easier to read, as it is immediately apparent to the reader
that nothing that _doesn't_ meet that prereq should be in the file. So
I'd be happy to see it switched (though it's not _that_ big a deal, so
leaving it is fine, too).

By the way, "prove --directives" can help with finding individual
skipped tests.
