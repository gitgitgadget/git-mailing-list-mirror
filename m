I am interested in this. Sorry to be so slow on reviewing. It's been on
my todo list for a while. I finally gave a look over it and sent some
thoughts. I focused mainly on high-level and design choices, and didn't
look _too_ closely at the code (from what I saw it was all pretty
reasonable, but if you agree with my suggestions there's some re-working
to be done anyway).

FYI, I'll be offline the rest of the week, but I'll try to stay on top
of it next week if you have responses to my comments.
