This all looks pretty reasonable to me.

I couldn't help but think, though, that surely we have some helpers for
this already? But the closest seems to be git_parse_int(), which also
allows unit factors. I'm not sure if allowing "-n 1k" would be a feature
or a bug. ;)

I guess "strtol_i()" maybe is that helper already, though I did not even
know it existed. Looks like it goes back to 2007, and is seldom used. I
wonder if there are more spots that could benefit.

I don't think there is any such helper for timestamps, but the checks in
your parser look good (strtol_i() checks for overflow as we cast to int,
but I don't think we need to do the same here since timestamp_t and
parse_timestamp() should be matched).
