I wasn't sure if we wanted to get into that. Your documentation update
(with an empty string) says only that they are "handled internally".
While it is true that we aren't handling %Z internally anymore, the
point is that we try to do something sane which may or may not match
what your system strftime() does. And that continues to be the case
after my patch.

So unless we are going to give the full breakdown of when %Z is empty
and when it is not, I prefer to leave it unspecified.

Thanks for checking.
