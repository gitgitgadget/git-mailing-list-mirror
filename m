It is a good idea to have a readme so people finding the project can
know more about it, and know how they can get involved.

I don't have much experience writing this kind of readme or
documentation, so comments are appreciated. Please feel free to chime in
with suggestions and things that can also be added.

+# Git Gui - A graphical user interface for Git
+
+Git Gui is a GUI for [git](https://git-scm.com/) written in Tcl/Tk. It allows
+you to use the git source control management tools via a GUI. This includes
+staging, commiting, adding, pushing, etc. It can also be used as a blame
+viewer, a tree browser, and a citool (make exactly one commit before exiting
+and returning to shell). More details about git-gui can be found in its manual
+page by either running `man git-gui`, or by visiting the [online manual
+page](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gui).
+
+Git Gui was initially written by Shawn O. Pearce, and is distributed with the
+standard git installation.
+
+# Building and installing
+
+Most of Git Gui is written in Tcl, so there is not much compilation involved.
+Still, some things do need to be done, so you do need to "build" it.
+
+You can build Git Gui using:
+
+```
+make
+```
+
+And then install it using:
+
+```
+make install
+```
+
+You probably need to have root/admin permissions to install.
+
+# Contributing
+
+The project is currently maintained by Pratyush Yadav over at
+https://github.com/prati0100/git-gui. Even though the project is hosted at
+GitHub, the development does not happen over GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.
+Instead, an email based workflow is used. The git mailing list
+[git@vger.kernel.org](mailto:git@vger.kernel.org) is where the patches are
+discussed and reviewed.
+
+More information about the git mailing list and instructions to subscribe can
+be found [here](https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/GitCommunity).
+
+## Sending your changes
+
+Since the development happens over email, you need to send in your commits in
+text format. Commits can be converted to emails via the two tools provided by
+git: `git-send-email` and `git-format-patch`.
+
+If you are sending multiple patches, it is recommended to include a cover
+letter. A cover letter is an email explaining in brief what the series is
+supposed to do. A cover letter template can be generated by passing
+`--cover-letter` to `git-format-patch`.
+
+After you send your patches, you might get a review suggesting some changes.
+Make those changes, and re-send your patch(es) in reply to the first patch of
+your initial version. Also please mention the version of the patch. This can be
+done by passing `-v X` to `git-format-patch`, where 'X' is the version number
+of the patch(es).
+
+### Using git-send-email
+
+You can use `git-send-email` to send patches via email. A pretty good guide to
+configuring and using `git-send-email` can be found
+[here](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/HowToUseGitSendEmail/)
+
+### Using your email client
+
+If your email client supports sending mbox format emails, you can use
+`git-format-patch` to get an mbox file for each commit, and then send them. If
+there is more than one patch in the series, then all patches after the first
+patch (or the cover letter) need to be sent as replies to the first.
+`git-send-email` does this by default.
+
+### Using GitGitGadget
+
+Since some people prefer a GitHub pull request based workflow, they can use
+[GitGitGadget](https://gitgitgadget.github.io/) to send in patches. The tool
+was originally written for sending patches to the Git project, but it now also
+supports sending patches for git-gui.
+
+Instructions for using GitGitGadget to send git-gui patches, courtesy of
+Johannes Schindelin:
+
+If you don't already have a fork of the [git/git](https://github.com/git/git)
+repo, you need to make one. Then clone your fork:
+
+```
+git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/git
+```
+
+Then add GitGitGadget as a remote:
+
+```
+git remote add gitgitgadget https://github.com/gitgitgadget/git
+```
+
+Then fetch the git-gui branch:
+
+```
+git fetch gitgitgadget git-gui/master
+```
+
+Then create a new branch based on git-gui/master:
+
+```
+git checkout -b <your-branch-name> git-gui/master
+```
+
+Make whatever commits you need to, push them to your fork, and then head over
+to https://github.com/gitgitgadget/git/pulls and open a Pull Request targeting
+git-gui/master.
+
+GitGitGadget will welcome you with a (hopefully) helpful message.
+
+## Signing off
+
+You need to sign off your commits before sending them to the list. You can do
+that by passing the `-s` option to `git-commit`. You can also use the "Sign
+Off" option in Git Gui.
+
+A sign-off is a simple 'Signed-off-by: A U Thor \<author@example.com\>' line at
+the end of the commit message, after your explanation of the commit.
+
+A sign-off means that you are legally allowed to send the code, and it serves
+as a certificate of origin. More information can be found at
+[developercertificate.org](https://developercertificate.org/).
