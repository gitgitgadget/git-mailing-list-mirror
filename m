I agree that there have been huge improvements---particularly in
documentation. So thanks to everybody!

Here's a simpler idea that might add the unification you're looking
for. How about a new option:

	git add -a|--all

This would allow "git commit -a|--all" to be understood as a simple
helper for:

	git add -a|--all
	git commit

That kind of unification seems like it could be helpful while learning
things. And I believe I've even wanted to do the "git add -a"
operation before, so I think it might be useful in its own right at
times, (though I can't think of a good example of why at the moment,
so perhaps its not that important).
