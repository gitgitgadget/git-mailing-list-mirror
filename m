Yeah, though now we have lifetime rules around stat_sep. How long does
it stay good? Which functions decide it's now done? Are we sure they
alweays get called? We're just tacking that onto the end of diff_flush()
because the caller responsibilities are so unclear, but that's making an
assumption that it always gets called.

This case might be simple enough that it's true, but it feels like a
leaky module boundary.

Right, I think that is the simplest thing, but it falls afoul of the
lifetime rules above.

If the rule is "the stat_sep gets printed once and then freed", that's
pretty reasonable. But I wonder if there are cases where we might not
print stat_sep (or call diff_flush at all for that matter). I'm not sure
if that's possible with --attach, though, which constrains us to
format-patch.

Actually, I guess the absolute simplest thing would be swap this out for
a static strbuf, and leave the ownership with the function. That's ugly,
but it's how it works now, and lets us drop the fixed buffer.

Another option is to put it in rev_info, and make the rev_info owner
free it (which we know is restricted to cmd_format_patch(), as it is the
only one who uses mime_boundary).
