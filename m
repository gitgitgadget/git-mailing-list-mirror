Eek. Thanks for catching this.

I wondered how I could have missed this, but it does work if somebody
else happens to have parsed it. For example:

  $ git log -1 --oneline --decorate v5.11
  f40ddce88593 (tag: v5.11) Linux 5.11

works because we'll already have parsed it as a traversal tip.

Your fix is _almost_ there. There's not much point in doing
oid_object_info() if we're just going to parse unconditionally. But we
would want to parse only tags.

And we even do parse tags recursively in the peeling loop. The trouble
is that we do so after realizing we need to recurse. We just need to
bump it up in the loop, like:

diff --git a/log-tree.c b/log-tree.c
index 4f69ed176d..6dc4412268 100644
--- a/log-tree.c
+++ b/log-tree.c

+			parse_object(the_repository, &obj->oid);

 		add_name_decoration(DECORATION_REF_TAG, refname, obj);
 	}
 	return 0;

That's the minimum needed to unbreak things. I think we could do even
better, though. There is no need for us to parse a commit object pointed
to by a tag here. We should only be parsing tags we see (whether at the
top-level or recursively).

Do you want to incorporate the fix above, or would you prefer me to pick
it up from here?

Yeah, definitely.

Right. After your patch, the oid_object_info() is pointless, because
we're still parsing everything (the "< 0" error check would only trigger
in a corrupted repo). And it adds some overhead, so it may even be
slightly slower than the original code. :)

The timings I get for "git log -1 --decorate" on git.git are:

  -  before either patch: 27.5ms
  - with my broken patch:  5.9ms
  - with the patch above: 11.3ms

which makes sense. I have a bunch of branches, and now we don't parse
them. We do still have to parse tags. On linux.git, where it's almost
entirely tags, most of the advantage dries up (but it would probably be
helped a bit by the further suggestion I gave above to avoid parsing
tagged commits).

On my big ~220k ref test case (where it's mostly non-tags), the timings
are:

  -  before either patch: 2.945s
  - with my broken patch: 0.707s
  - with the patch above: 0.788s

so the savings are retained.

I think it's probably OK to count on it being stable. We iterate the
refs in a stable order to insert them, and then store the result as a
linked list. If that strategy ever changed, I think we'd end up doing a
manual sort on them to get a stable order anyway.

This presumably breaks when the tests are run in sha256 mode. Coupled
with the ordering simplification, maybe:

        cat >expect <<-\EOF &&
        three HEAD -> source-b, tag: three, tag: source-tag
        one tag: one
        EOF
        git log --format="%s %D" >actual &&
        test_cmp expect actual

(or maybe %d is more readable in the output; it doesn't matter much if
we're matching it verbatim).

Thanks again for noticing this.
