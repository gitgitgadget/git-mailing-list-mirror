The community is already fractured! I think we actually have very tiny
fraction of the user base on the mailing list - the traffic is simply
too massive. After all we chose _our_ convenience over _users'_
convenience in making this tradeoff. Also, as I mentioned in the other
mail, it's not obvious to me whether major part of our community would
be willing to participate in any mailing list at all.

(Note that I don't want to imply that this would be inherently a Bad
Thing. Some feedback still bubbles through and we have ways like Jakub's
Git User Survey as well. Maybe the user community is by now simply too
big to make the direct cross-pollination with developers feasible.)

There was a proposal some time ago for making a web forum for Git; maybe
we were too dismissive to the suggestion. I wonder where *do* these 100k
of registered GitHubbers get their Git support now? :-)
