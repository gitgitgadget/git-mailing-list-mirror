I'd like to add to Linus' suggested course of action the task "look up
threat in a dictionary".

If _you_ need the functionality, you can easily keep it around in _your_
copy.  That's what I do with a few patches that were not accepted here.
So the "risk of rejection" has no real cost for you (apart from an
occasional rebase on origin, which is cheap).  Just for others.  And of
no-one else argues your case, then they probably don't mind.
