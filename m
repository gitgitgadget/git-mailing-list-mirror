I think the way you adjusted the preamble is good. It matches this prior
work before --ancestry-path:

	Finally, there is a fifth simplification mode available:

	--ancestry-path::
		(description)
	+
	(example)
	+
	...

And you're right, we do drop the "--show-pulls::" itemization. Will that
make it hard to link to that exact option? Probably.

What about the fixup below, to create this list item?

Thanks,
