The idea was to use ./configure to _generate_ config.mak, which the user can
then edit.

But perhaps using another filename for results of ./configure script 
(and including it in main Makefile) would be better idea.

But one might want to run ./configure with different options, to finally
arrive at the set which is satisfactionary. So unless some magic to detect
if config.mak was generated from ./configure script, or generated by user
is used...
