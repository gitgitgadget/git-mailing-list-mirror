Hi,

Latest news from the google summer of code: students have completed their proposals. We have 2 proposals for "convert scripts to builtins", and 4 for "unify git branch, git tag and git for-each-ref" (plus some out-of-scope proposals). See http://git.github.io/SoC-2015-Ideas.html for more details about the projects.

We have to request slots before April 13th.

My guess is that we'll request 2 slots, and from previous discussions I don't think we will have difficulties to find enough co-mentors. Still, if you're interested in mentoring a project, now would be a good time to say so.

Without committing to mentor a student, you can also join the Git organisation on https://www.google-melange.com/ if you want to see/review/rate/discuss students proposals.

Stefan: you said you were interested in mentoring. If it's still the case, then please create an account on melange and request the "mentor" role for Git.

Regards,
