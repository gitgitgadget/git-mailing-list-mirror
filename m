It features "Companies & Projects Using Git" at the bottom.  Not
"supporting" but "using".

Linux is point 10 on that list.  The first 6 items are Google, facebook,
Microsoft, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Netflix.

Even for an OpenSource project that does not buy into the Free Software
philosophy, that is a mostly embarrassing list of companies to advertise
for.

Personally, I consider the recent migration of the Emacs repository to
Git a bigger endorsement but then that's me.

It might make sense to reduce this list just to "Projects" since those
are actually more tangible and verifiable.  Or scrap it altogether.
