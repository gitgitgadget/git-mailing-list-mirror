This patch series implements the corrected commit date offsets as generation
number v2, along with other pre-requisites.

Git uses topological levels in the commit-graph file for commit-graph
traversal operations like git log --graph. Unfortunately, using topological
levels can result in a worse performance than without them when compared
with committer date as a heuristics. For example, git merge-base v4.8 v4.9 
on the Linux repository walks 635,579 commits using topological levels and
walks 167,468 using committer date.

Thus, the need for generation number v2 was born. New generation number
needed to provide good performance, increment updates, and backward
compatibility. Due to an unfortunate problem 1
[https://public-inbox.org/git/87a7gdspo4.fsf@evledraar.gmail.com/], we also
needed a way to distinguish between the old and new generation number
without incrementing graph version.

Various candidates were examined (https://github.com/derrickstolee/gen-test, 
https://github.com/abhishekkumar2718/git/pull/1). The proposed generation
number v2, Corrected Commit Date with Mononotically Increasing Offsets 
performed much worse than committer date (506,577 vs. 167,468 commits walked
for git merge-base v4.8 v4.9) and was dropped.

Using Generation Data chunk (GDAT) relieves the requirement of backward
compatibility as we would continue to store topological levels in Commit
Data (CDAT) chunk. Thus, Corrected Commit Date was chosen as generation
number v2. The Corrected Commit Date is defined as:

For a commit C, let its corrected commit date be the maximum of the commit
date of C and the corrected commit dates of its parents plus 1. Then 
corrected commit date offset is the difference between corrected commit date
of C and commit date of C. As a special case, a root commit with timestamp
zero has corrected commit date of 1 to be able distinguish it from
GENERATION_NUMBER_ZERO (that is, an uncomputed corrected commit date).

We will introduce an additional commit-graph chunk, Generation Data chunk,
and store corrected commit date offsets in GDAT chunk while storing
topological levels in CDAT chunk. The old versions of Git would ignore GDAT
chunk, using topological levels from CDAT chunk. In contrast, new versions
of Git would use corrected commit dates, falling back to topological level
if the generation data chunk is absent in the commit-graph file.

While storing corrected commit date offsets saves us 4 bytes per commit (as
compared with storing corrected commit dates directly), it's possible for
the offset to overflow the space allocated. To handle such cases, we
introduce a new chunk, Generation Data Overflow (GDOV) that stores the
corrected commit date. For overflowing offsets, we set MSB and store the
position into the GDOV chunk, in a mechanism similar to the Extra Edges list
chunk.

For mixed generation number environment (for example new Git on the command
line, old Git used by GUI client), we can encounter a mixed-chain
commit-graph (a commit-graph chain where some of split commit-graph files
have GDAT chunk and others do not). As backward compatibility is one of the
goals, we can define the following behavior:

While reading a mixed-chain commit-graph version, we fall back on
topological levels as corrected commit dates and topological levels cannot
be compared directly.

While writing on top of a split commit-graph, we check if the tip of the
chain has a GDAT chunk. If it does, we append to the chain, writing GDAT
chunk. Thus, we guarantee if the topmost split commit-graph file has a GDAT
chunk, rest of the chain does too.

If the topmost split commit-graph file does not have a GDAT chunk (meaning
it has been appended by the old Git), we write without GDAT chunk. We do
write a GDAT chunk when the existing chain does not have GDAT chunk - when
we are writing to the commit-graph chain with the 'replace' strategy.

Thanks to Dr. Stolee, Dr. NarÄ™bski, and Taylor for their reviews.

I look forward to everyone's reviews!

Thanks

 * Abhishek


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in version 4:

 * Added GDOV to handle overflows in generation data.
 * Added a test for writing tip graph for a generation number v2 graph chain
   in t5324-split-commit-graph.sh
 * Added a section on how mixed generation number chains are handled in 
   Documentation/technical/commit-graph-format.txt
 * Reverted unimportant whitespace, style changes in commit-graph.c
 * Added header comments about the order of comparision for
   compare_commits_by_gen_then_commit_date in commit.h,
   compare_commits_by_gen in commit-graph.h
 * Elaborated on why t6404 fails with corrected commit date and must be run
   with GIT_TEST_COMMIT_GRAPH=1in the commit "commit-reach: use corrected
   commit dates in paint_down_to_common()"
 * Elaborated on write behavior for mixed generation number chains in the
   commit "commit-graph: use generation v2 only if entire chain does"
 * Added notes about adding the topo_level slab to struct
   write_commit_graph_context as well as struct commit_graph.
 * Clarified commit message for "commit-graph: consolidate
   fill_commit_graph_info"
 * Removed the claim "GDAT can store future generation numbers" because it
   hasn't been tested yet.

Changes in version 3:

 * Reordered patches as discussed in 2
   [https://lore.kernel.org/git/aee0ae56-3395-6848-d573-27a318d72755@gmail.com/]
   .
 * Split "implement corrected commit date" into two patches - one
   introducing the topo level slab and other implementing corrected commit
   dates.
 * Extended split-commit-graph tests to verify at the end of test.
 * Use topological levels as generation number if any of split commit-graph
   files do not have generation data chunk.

Changes in version 2:

 * Add tests for generation data chunk.
 * Add an option GIT_TEST_COMMIT_GRAPH_NO_GDAT to control whether to write
   generation data chunk.
 * Compare commits with corrected commit dates if present in
   paint_down_to_common().
 * Update technical documentation.
 * Handle mixed generation commit chains.
 * Improve commit messages for "commit-graph: fix regression when computing
   bloom filter", "commit-graph: consolidate fill_commit_graph_info",
 * Revert unnecessary whitespace changes.
 * Split uint_32 -> timestamp_t change into a new commit.

     -    The test used to pass as fill_commit_in_graph() guarantees the values of

     -    However, with corrected commit date we will need load the timestamp as

     +    e51217e15 (t5000: test tar files that overflow ustar headers,
     +    30-06-2016) introduced a test 'generate tar with future mtime' that
     +    creates a commit with committer date of (2 ^ 36 + 1) seconds since
     +    EPOCH. The CDAT chunk provides 34-bits for storing committer date, thus
     +    committer time overflows into generation number (within CDAT chunk) and
     +    has undefined behavior.
      
     -    Let's fix the test by setting a timestamp of (2 ^ 34 - 1) seconds.
     +    The test used to pass as fill_commit_graph_info() would not set struct
     +    member `date` of struct commit and loads committer date from the object
     +    database, generating a tar file with the expected mtime.
     +
     +    However, with corrected commit date, we will load the committer date
     +    from CDAT chunk (truncated to lower 34-bits to populate the generation
     +    number. Thus, Git sets date and generates tar file with the truncated
     +    mtime.
     +
     +    The ustar format (the header format used by most modern tar programs)
     +    only has room for 11 (or 12, depending om some implementations) octal
     +    digits for the size and mtime of each files.
     +
     +    Thus, setting a timestamp of 2 ^ 33 + 1 would overflow the 11-octal
     +    digit implementations while still fitting into commit data chunk.
     +
     +    Since we want to test 12-octal digit implementations of ustar as well,
     +    let's modify the existing test to no longer use commit-graph file.

          commit-graph: add a slab to store topological levels
      
     -    As we are writing topological levels to commit data chunk to ensure
     -    backwards compatibility with "Old" Git and the member `generation` of
     -    struct commit_graph_data will store corrected commit date in a later
     -    commit, let's introduce a commit-slab to store topological levels while
     -    writing commit-graph.
     +    In a later commit we will introduce corrected commit date as the
     +    generation number v2. This value will be stored in the new seperate
     +    Generation Data chunk. However, to ensure backwards compatibility with
     +    "Old" Git we need to continue to write generation number v1, which is
     +    topological level, to the commit data chunk. This means that we need to
     +    compute both versions of generation numbers when writing the
     +    commit-graph file. Therefore, let's introduce a commit-slab to store
     +    topological levels; corrected commit date will be stored in the member
     +    `generation` of struct commit_graph_data.
      
          When Git creates a split commit-graph, it takes advantage of the
          generation values that have been computed already and present in
          existing commit-graph files.
      
     -    So, let's add a pointer to struct commit_graph to the topological level
     -    commit-slab and populate it with topological levels while writing a
     -    split commit-graph.
     +    So, let's add a pointer to struct commit_graph as well as struct
     +    write_commit_graph_context to the topological level commit-slab
     +    and populate it with topological levels while writing a commit-graph
     +    file.

            the maximum of its commit date and one more than the largest corrected
            commit date among its parents.
      
     +    As a special case, a root commit with timestamp of zero (01.01.1970
     +    00:00:00Z) has corrected commit date of one, to be able to distinguish
     +    from GENERATION_NUMBER_ZERO (that is, an uncomputed corrected commit
     +    date).
     +
          To minimize the space required to store corrected commit date, Git
          stores corrected commit date offsets into the commit-graph file. The
          corrected commit date offset for a commit is defined as the difference
          between its corrected commit date and actual commit date.
      
     +    Storing corrected commit date requires sizeof(timestamp_t) bytes, which
     +    in most cases is 64 bits (uintmax_t). However, corrected commit date
     +    offsets can be safely stored using only 32-bits. This halves the size
     +    of GDAT chunk, which is a reduction of around 6% in the size of
     +    commit-graph file.
     +
     +    However, using offsets be problematic if one of commits is malformed but
     +    valid and has committerdate of 0 Unix time, as the offset would be the
     +    same as corrected commit date and thus require 64-bits to be stored
     +    properly.
     +
          While Git does not write out offsets at this stage, Git stores the
          corrected commit dates in member generation of struct commit_graph_data.
          It will begin writing commit date offsets with the introduction of

          between graph versions in a backwards compatible manner.
      
          We are going to introduce a new chunk called Generation Data chunk (or
     -    GDAT). GDAT stores generation number v2 (and any subsequent versions),
     -    whereas CDAT will still store topological level.
     +    GDAT). GDAT stores corrected committer date offsets whereas CDAT will
     +    still store topological level.
      
          Old Git does not understand GDAT chunk and would ignore it, reading
          topological levels from CDAT. New Git can parse GDAT and take advantage
     @@ Commit message
          which forces commit-graph file to be written without generation data
          chunk to emulate a commit-graph file written by old Git.
      
     +    While storing corrected commit date offset instead of the corrected
     +    commit date saves us 4 bytes per commit, it's possible for the offsets
     +    to overflow the 4-bytes allocated. As such overflows are exceedingly
     +    rare, we use the following overflow management scheme:
     +
     +    We introduce a new commit-graph chunk, GENERATION_DATA_OVERFLOW ('GDOV')
     +    to store corrected commit dates for commits with offsets greater than
     +    GENERATION_NUMBER_V2_OFFSET_MAX.
     +
     +    If the offset is greater than GENERATION_NUMBER_V2_OFFSET_MAX, we set
     +    the MSB of the offset and the other bits store the position of corrected
     +    commit date in GDOV chunk, similar to how Extra Edge List is maintained.
     +
     +    We test the overflow-related code with the following repo history:
     +
     +               F - N - U
     +              /         \
     +    U - N - U            N
     +             \          /
     +              N - F - N
     +
     +    Where the commits denoted by U have committer date of zero seconds
     +    since Unix epoch, the commits denoted by N have committer date of
     +    1112354055 (default committer date for the test suite) seconds since
     +    Unix epoch and the commits denoted by F have committer date of
     +    (2 ^ 31 - 2) seconds since Unix epoch.
     +
     +    The largest offset observed is 2 ^ 31, just large enough to overflow.

          commits in the lower layer before allowing the topo-order queue to write
          anything to output (depending on the size of the upper layer).
      
     +    When writing the new layer in split commit-graph, we write a GDAT chunk
     +    only if the topmost layer has a GDAT chunk. This guarantees that if a

     +    does not have GDAT chunks either.

 10:  439adc1718 !  9:  bb9b02af32 commit-reach: use corrected commit dates in paint_down_to_common()
     @@ Commit message
          With corrected commit dates implemented, we no longer have to rely on
          commit date as a heuristic in paint_down_to_common().
      
     -    t6024-recursive-merge setups a unique repository where all commits have
     -    the same committer date without well-defined merge-base. As this has
     -    already caused problems (as noted in 859fdc0 (commit-graph: define
     -    GIT_TEST_COMMIT_GRAPH, 2018-08-29)), we disable commit graph within the
     -    test script.
     +    While using corrected commit dates Git walks nearly the same number of
     +    commits as commit date, the process is slower as for each comparision we
     +    have to access a commit-slab (for corrected committer date) instead of
     +    accessing struct member (for committer date).
     +
     +    For example, the command `git merge-base v4.8 v4.9` on the linux
     +    repository walks 167468 commits, taking 0.135s for committer date and
     +    167496 commits, taking 0.157s for corrected committer date respectively.
     +
     +    t6404-recursive-merge setups a unique repository where all commits have
     +    the same committer date without well-defined merge-base.
     +
     +    While running tests with GIT_TEST_COMMIT_GRAPH unset, we use committer
     +    date as a heuristic in paint_down_to_common(). 6404.1 'combined merge
     +    conflicts' merges commits in the order:
     +    - Merge C with B to form a intermediate commit.
     +    - Merge the intermediate commit with A.
     +
     +    With GIT_TEST_COMMIT_GRAPH=1, we write a commit-graph and subsequently
     +    use the corrected committer date, which changes the order in which
     +    commits are merged:
     +    - Merge A with B to form a intermediate commit.
     +    - Merge the intermediate commit with C.
     +
     +    While resulting repositories are equivalent, 6404.4 'virtual trees were
     +    processed' fails with GIT_TEST_COMMIT_GRAPH=1 as we are selecting
     +    different merge-bases and thus have different object ids for the
     +    intermediate commits.
     +
     +    As this has already causes problems (as noted in 859fdc0 (commit-graph:
     +    define GIT_TEST_COMMIT_GRAPH, 2018-08-29)), we disable commit graph
     +    within t6404-recursive-merge.

     ++## Handling Mixed Generation Number Chains
     ++
     ++With the introduction of generation number v2 and generation data chunk, the
     ++following scenario is possible:
     ++
     ++1. "New" Git writes a commit-graph with the corrected commit dates.
     ++2. "Old" Git writes a split commit-graph on top without corrected commit dates.
     ++
     ++A naive approach of using the newest available generation number from
     ++each layer would lead to violated expectations: the lower layer would
     ++use corrected commit dates which are much larger than the topological
     ++levels of the higher layer. For this reason, Git inspects each layer to
     ++see if any layer is missing corrected commit dates. In such a case, Git
     ++only uses topological level
     ++
     ++When writing a new layer in split commit-graph, we write corrected commit
     ++dates if the topmost layer has corrected commit dates written. This
     ++guarantees that if a layer has corrected commit dates, all lower layers
     ++must have corrected commit dates as well.
     ++
     ++When merging layers, we do not consider whether the merged layers had corrected
     ++commit dates. Instead, the new layer will have corrected commit dates if and
     ++only if all existing layers below the new layer have corrected commit dates.
