Not at all. It would be a purely optional. You would never even need to know the
feature existed if you didn't want to use it. So I'm not sure how that is
forcing it upon anyone.

Moreover, I suggested it b/c I would find such a feature very useful, and, by
extension, thought others might as well. Perhaps others have done something
similar, in which case it would be interesting the hear their take, or on the
other hand they've never considered it before, but now can consider the
potential utility of just such a feature.

There is no need to make one. It's purely annotative.
