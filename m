This list is for the development of Git. There is a googlegroups list 
for git users. However..

A detached head simply means that you are looking at a specific commit 
((hash number)), rather than the 'latest commit on the branch'.

You did not say which OS you were on, or if you prefer the command line, 
or a visualÂ  gui to see the current arrangement of your commits - the 
'gitk' viewer is useful for the latter.

If you have already made some commits on the 'detached head' then use 
the 'git branch' command, or 'git checkout -b' to create a branch name 
for your new commits (check the manual). Having named the new commits, 
you can get back to link the bits together. You can use 'cherry-pick' to 
pick of individual commits from that new branch onto the new 
destination, or use rebase if there is a series.
