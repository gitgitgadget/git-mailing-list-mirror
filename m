I think the alignment here is fine. We're just writing out an individual
value. So in the original entry->hash and our local hash_value are both
properly aligned, since they're declared as uint32_t. We pass the
pointer to hashwrite(), but it doesn't expect any particular alignment.
After the patch, the situation is the same, except that we're working
with the uint32_t parameter to hashwrite_be32(), which is also properly
aligned.

So I think this is what we should do. :)

No need here; get_be32() is for when we're reading in from an unaligned
mmap.

Likewise, I don't think there's any reason to do this. hashwrite_be32()
gets its parameter as a value, not a pointer. So even if it were coming
from an unaligned mmap, it's actually the _caller_ who would have to
use get_be32() when passing it.

There is a bug in our fork, but I don't think it's upstream. The
relevant spot for the name-hash cache is in show_objects_for_type(),
which reads from the bitmap->hashes pointer (that points into our
unaligned mmap). But it does:

        if (bitmap_git->hashes)
                hash = get_be32(bitmap_git->hashes + entry->nr);

which is correct (using htonl() would not be). The bug is that in our
fork, we have a custom bit-cache extension[1] which does use htonl(),
and should be get_be32(). That's something we'll need to clean up when
we send those patches upstream.

[1] For the curious, the point is it keep a cache of the bit position of
    each object, which lets us ask "is this object's bit set" without
    having to load the revindex. It's helpful for bitmap-optimizing some
    algorithms like "branch --contains", though I think we should
    re-evaluate how much it helps now that we have commit-graphs with
    generation numbers.
