And Jakub by far is not the only one using gmane for reading and writing
to the list.

I am reading and writing on a number of mailing lists with either
explicit or implicit gateways to news servers.  But the git mailing list
is the only one where I ever encountered a semi-permanent stream of
(sometimes quite rude) complaints because people insist on getting
replies at least twice: once by the mailing list, and once by personal
Email.  In contrast to claims made here, it is _not_ common netiquette
to create extra personal copies.  In fact, for articles sent through
Usenet servers, it is generally considered an _annoyance_ to include
unannounced "courtesy copies" since replies to them will not usually
reach the list and will require redoing.

And I have received complaints about accumulating Cc lists from mailing
list moderators as well, since list servers tend to queue stuff for
moderation once the Cc header reaches a certain size.

I really don't get the point of those demands for personal extra copies:
do people or don't they read the mailing list?

On the current computer setup, I am answering to the list.  On a
different computer, all mail to the mailing list disappears into a black
hole without any indication why.  So I _have_ to use gmane there.  And I
don't see why I should get heat for that when apparently the
automoderation of the list is set up as rabidly as to quietly censor
everything I send via Email (everybody else is able to receive mail
through that account from me).
