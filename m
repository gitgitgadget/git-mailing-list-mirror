I'm not sure where you're from, but quite a few countries who are
members of the european union are also member of the visa waiver
program and don't need visas to visit the us unless they:
* have been suspected of a crime in the past 10 years (not only
  convicted, suspected is enough)
* are first-generation immigrants
* could in some really, really far-fetched way be suspected to be
  related to be connected to one of the several hundred thousand
  terrorist organizations around the world

Check with your american embassy. They're quite friendly, provided
you don't call them before american business hours have started. I
believe it's something of a conundrum in china and australia, but
perhaps the embassies there make special arrangements.
