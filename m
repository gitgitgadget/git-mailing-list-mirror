''' What is your Organization's Name? '''

Git Development Community

''' What is your Organization's Homepage? '''

[http://git.or.cz/]

''' Describe your organization. '''

The Git development community is a loosly knitted team of developers,
documentation writers and end-users with the common goal of
building and maintaining a high quality revision control system.
As an offshoot of the Linux kernel team, we take great pride in
our open development methdology and emphasis on quality.

''' Why is your organization applying to participate in GSoC 2007? What
do you hope to gain by participating? '''

Although Git has developed from absolutely nothing to one of the
most useful version control systems in less than 2 years, there are
still a wide number of new and exciting features that users continue
to ask about.  We hope to engage several students in projects that
will bring some of these features to life, or to create features
that have not even been considered.

''' Did your organization participate in GSoC 2005 or 2006? If so,
please summarize your involvement and the successes and failures
of your student projects. '''

No.

''' If your organization has not previously participated in GSoC,
have you applied in the past? If so, for what year(s)? '''

We did not apply in the past.  This is our first application.

''' Who will your organization administrator be? Please include Google
Account information. '''

Shawn O. Pearce (have Google Account)

Unless Junio wants it?

''' What license does your project use? '''

GPL (GNU Public License)

''' What is the URL for your ideas page? '''

[http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/SoC2007Ideas]

''' What is the main development mailing list for your organization? '''

git@vger.kernel.org

''' What is the main IRC channel for your organization? '''

#git on irc.freenode.org.

''' Does your organization have an application template you would like
to see students use? If so, please provide it now. '''

NEEDED?

''' Who will be your backup organization administrator? Please include
Google Account information. '''

NEEDED!  BADLY!

''' Who will your mentors be? Please include Google Account
Information. '''

 * Shawn O. Pearce (have Google Account)
 * Martin Langhoff (need Google Account)

[sp: Nice if we had a few more!]

''' What criteria did you use to select these individuals as
mentors? Please be as specific as possible. '''

All mentors volunteered for the specific project(s) that they could
contribute the most to.  All mentors are active contributers within
the Git development community.

Active contributers are defined to be those who have submitted and
have had accepted into a shipped release a substational amount of
new code or fixes within the last 4 months (Nov 2006 - Mar 2007).
Substational amount of code is defined to be equal in size (or
larger) to what might be reasonably expected of a student working
on a Google Summer of Code project.

In short, all mentors are well known within the Git development
community for their accomplishments and contributions.

''' What is your plan for dealing with disappearing students? '''

Every reasonable effort will be made to maintain contact with
students and ensure they are making progress throughout the summer.

NEEDED! BADLY!

''' What is your plan for dealing with disappearing mentors? '''

In the unlikely event that a mentor disappears during the summer
another mentor will be arranged to step in.  The Git community has
plenty of good people within that would be more than happy to help
a student finish their project.

''' What steps will you take to encourage students to interact with
your project's community before, during and after the program? '''

Students will be required to join the main development mailing
list, post bi-weekly project updates to same, and post patches for
discussion to same.  Likewise all current contributors already do
this, so students will see the experienced hands doing the same
thing, thereby helping the students to stay a part of the community.

Mailing list traffic is currently around 100 messages per day,
maximum, and is focused completely on Git feature development.
Keeping current by at least skimming list messages is an important
part of the Git development process.

Students will be encouraged to post their work as a Git repository
on repo.or.cz (an open community hosting server) so that their work
is immediately available for everyone to review, experiment with,
and hopefully make use of.

Mentors will exchange email with students on at least a weekly basis,
if not more frequently.  Frequent email and IRC interaction with
mentors will be strongly encouraged.

''' What will you do to ensure that your accepted students stick with
the project after GSoC concludes? '''

Mentors (and hopefully by then other members of the Git development
community) will try to keep in touch with students by email.  We hope
that by monitoring the mailing list during the GSoC students will
find other projects that may be of interest (at least one interesting
idea pops up every week, with not enough people to work on them),
and that they can be encouraged into working on them even after
they have returned to their studies.
