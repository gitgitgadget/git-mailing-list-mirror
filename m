You seem to be right when viewing from the perspective of the callee 
(strbuf_check_branch_ref). IOW, you *seem* to be telling that the 
"callee" should have known that the caller was expecting the 'prefix' 
even in case of an error and should have "inserted" it regardless of the 
error (I thought the strbuf was initialized and contained the result of 
strbuf_branchname even in the case of an error) ?

I thought that the 'caller' should have known that the 'callee' would 
not insert the prefix when there was an error in the branch name thus it 
should have anticipated that there would be a case in which the prefix 
(refs/heads/) doesn't exist in the buf (the assumption).

Let me see if I could correlate your statement with that error. AFAIK, I 
don't think the buffer was uninitialized in the case of that error. It 
had in it the result of interpretation of 'strbuf_branchname', didn't 
it? So that clears one case and leads me to the interpretation that,

"Passing the data (at an offset of 11 bytes from the beginning of the 
buf) that does not begin with "refs/heads/" is a bug"

Which seems to be in line with my statement that it was wrong (in the 
part of the "caller") to assume that "strbuf_check_branch_ref" always 
returns a buf with the prefix "refs/heads/" ?

Makes sense. I should have better done this initially instead of giving 
a muddy justification for not doing it.


Thanks,
