Well crap. That explains far too much about what is happening. ðŸ˜Š. One of the special parameters is specified as -S \$ZSSH2 (example, referring to the process name - which begin with $ and have to be escaped with \). This obviously triggers the alternate path and has been problematic. On the older systems, we found fewer (a.k.a just about none) uses of this parameter, so never encountered it. On the newer systems, virtually everyone is using -S. Ergo, behavioural differences. That explains a whole lot of why we need a wrapper script. Thanks for the pointer to the strcspn() reference. I can stop obsessing about this (thanks too Johannes, Szeder, Ã†var) for the help.

As a suggestion, with people who know how to escape stuff properly (or not), perhaps we can select the alternate behaviour explicitly using a core.sshIgnoreEscape=true/false option. Thoughts on that?

Regards,
Randall
