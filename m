I don't think there's really a valid case. Keep in mind that this isn't
checking for the object on-disk at all. It's only checking:

  - were we able to parse the tag at all (i.e., is it syntactically
    valid)

  - does it have a type we know about

  - were we able to create an in-memory struct, meaning we did not see
    the same oid with a different type elsewhere in the same process

The first and middle imply a corruption or malicious attack. The second
could mean forward-compatibility is a concern, but I think this is the
tip of the iceberg. You really need a Git that understands the object
types you're working with, or basically everything is going to fail.

So I'm not too concerned with tightening this code. The question to me
is whether to do it in parse_tag(), or when accessing tag->tagged, or
both.

There's not much discussion on the list from that thread, but searching
for messages from Martin around that the main goal was protecting
against corruptions. So I think these NULL checks were attempting to do
the same thing we're doing here, just in a less centralized way.

That wouldn't cover all of the other reasons that we might have seen a
parse failure (so it fixes "tagged == NULL", but means that a subsequent
parse_tag() will silently return success).

I think the multiple error messages may be OK given that this is
explicitly covering a corrupt situation. But the more robust way is
adding an extra bit to say "I parsed this already, and it was corrupt"
to cause parse_tag() to return an error reliably.
