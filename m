Hi there,

I am interested in helping out and improving git, though I haven't
programmed in C for quite a while now and thus have to relearn quite so=
me
things.=20
I understand the different branches (master, next, pu) and so on, and w=
ere
successful in compiling git with my Ubuntu 9.04. [yeea] ;)

One thing I would like to ask you: what, if any, IDEs are you working w=
ith?
I tried Anjuta but were unsuccessful in importing the git folder from a=
ny
branch into Anjuta. Eclipse worked a bit better, though I am still batt=
eling
with the debugger a bit.

Any recommendations, manuals or how-to tips are greatly welcome.
And one thing: thank you for your effort! Git really caught my attentio=
n and
I was so much amused by the Google-Techtalk that Linus gave about Git, =
that
it sparked my interest in relearning how to program again ;)

Best regards from lovely Dresden in Germany
