I assumed that not all header files would want to advertise themselves
as a public API, so we'd want to some way to differentiate these from
first comments in "other" header files (and I assumed we did not want a
separate list of "these are the API files to go into the index", at
which point you might as well just write "standard string type" in that
list).

But I'm happy with any convention that lets Ã†var generate the index he
wants.

Yeah, I'd agree with all of that.

Looks neat. Doesn't seem to be package for Debian, though. ;)

Yes, I'd agree with that. About half of technical/* is design docs, etc,
that might be of use to random folks. But the internal code APIs are
really only useful if you have an actual clone of git.git.
