Code using this is already in master - in the result of overwriting
data->hash_algo, every piece of code, that was modernised starts using
the selected hash algorithm (through the_hash_algo) instead of hardcoded
sha-1.

As far as I can tell status is following:

Once following topics will land:
- po/object-id (in pu)
- brian's object-id-part-11 (in review now)
- upcoming brian's object-id-part-12 (not sent to mailing list yet)
- few more object-id conversions and uses of the_hash_algo

we'll be in state, where just dropping new entry in hash_algos table
will enable experimental switching of object format.

With changes listed above "git hash-object -w -t blob" and
"git cat-file" work with NewHash (whatever it may be - brian is using 
blake2 in his experiments, I am using openssl sha3-256).

Right now I am looking at updating index structures and functions - 
after which git commit should work. In the transition plan it's 
described as "introducing index v3" (are there any new requirements, 
that constitute "v3" besides longer hash?).

Mostly convenience for developers, who want to work on transition. 
There's no need to re-compile only for changing default hashing 
algorithm (which is useful for testing and debugging). I could carry 
this patch around to every NewHash-related branch, that I work on but 
it's annoying me already ;)

As long as hash_algos table contains only sha-1, users effectively see
this extension as noop.

What about users, who are using new version of Git, but have it 
misconfigured with preciousObjects and repo format 0? That's why I 
decided to make repo format check specific to objectFormat extension 
(initially I made it generic to all extensions).

At the same time... there's extension.partialclone in pu and it does not 
have check on repo format.
