I mentioned "5" because that is the current value of MAXDEPTH. I do
think it would be reasonable to bump it to something higher.

I think it's probably more important to match the rest of the OS, so
that open("foo") and realpath("foo") behave similarly on the same
system. Though I think even that isn't always possible, as the limit is
dynamic on some systems.

I think the idea of the 20-30 range is that it's small enough to catch
an infinite loop quickly, and large enough that nobody will ever hit it
in practice. :)
