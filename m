I can make the change, but I do want to point out that the current
use of a repository extension _does_ mean that tools that (correctly)
interact with a Git repository should fail even if they don't try to
access the index file. This is only something to make this work until
we introduce a new index file format version and then can drop the
extension.

"git filter-repo" _should_ be safe because it's really just shelling
to Git, right? I'm more concerned about tools like libgit2.

Thanks,
