All of the above smells like taking us in a sensible direction.  I
agree with these design decisions described in the above, i.e.
'pager.tag.list falling back to pager.tag', making this an opt-in to
make code transition easier.

Even though it is purely internal thing, IGNORE_PAGER_CONFIG
probably is a bit confusion-inducing name.  After all, the
subcommand specific configuration is not being ignored---we are
merely delaying our reaction to it---instead of acting on it inside
git.c without giving the subcommand a chance to make a decision, we
are still letting (and we do expect) the subcommand to react to it.

But that is a fairly minor thing we can fix.

I see you CC'ed Peff who's passionate in this area, so these patches
are in good hands already ;-) I briefly skimmed your patches myself,
and did not spot anything glaringly wrong.

Thanks.
