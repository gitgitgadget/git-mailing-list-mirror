Yeah, I didn't think of that with respect to the pager. This is a
regression in v2.14.2, I think.

I agree that anything that is "auto" on stdout probably ought to kick in
when the pager is in effect (since that only kicks in when stdout _was_
a tty before we stuck a pager in front of it).

The test in t9002 should be immune to this, but the one you suggest in
t7006 would need to set COLUMNS to get consistent output, I think.

I think it might work out either way. If we have started the pager when
we finalize_colopts(), then the pager_in_use() bit will kick in. If we
haven't, then either:

  1. stdout is a tty, and we'll kick in the auto behavior for columns,
     and then later for the pager.

  2. stdout isn't a tty, in which case we also won't kick in the pager.
