Unfortunately, I am really wasted by this weekend's efforts to bring 
msysgit.git along... could you be so kind as to cut&paste the relevant 
section in a reply to me, so I do not have to search for myself?

I would not normally ask for such a favour; it is relatively easy to go on 
a search with Git, but I do have only 8 hours of sleep in the last 60 
hours under my saddle...

Ciao,
Dscho
