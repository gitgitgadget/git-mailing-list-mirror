Aha! Thanks.

It doesn't appear I had the 40-character ref problem, nor was I
exceeding the 900 ref limit. But I was definitely well over the 16 ref
limit.

I updated as soon as I got your reply, but just waited until I hit a
repeat of the use case today, (I was just too lazy to try to roll
things back and duplicate the exact same conditions).

Sure enough, things seem to be much better now (git version
1.4.2.1.g16fd), so thanks for the fix.
