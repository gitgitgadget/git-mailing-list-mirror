Good point. There are really two thresholds: is this something that
should be totally forbidden, and is this something that is generally a
good idea. I think the answers here are "no" and "yes" respectively.

It is an OK solution for "plain old data" types like date_mode that are
essentially just marshalling arguments, but not for more object-oriented
code that might have ownership over pointers.

Ren√© already went through each caller, but yeah, I think it is fine
here. This whole thing is just a convenience over having callers pass
around a separated (enum, strftime_fmt, local) triple.
