Dear Git developers and users,

We're an organization focused on improving innovation and technology
adoption in Georgia. We are mainly funded by the government and are
eager to tackle problems using new and innovative technologies. This
includes building of tech parks, iLabs, FabLabs, incubators and
accelerators.

To help achieve this however, we need to have specialists.
Therefor, one of our tasks is to train future trainers, so that they
become skilled in training future experts.

We would love to discuss options to invite you to Georgia to give
basic and intermediate Git training to our trainers.

Contact us if you're interested in working together and otherwise
please still let us know what you think.

Best regards,

Irakli Apakidze
