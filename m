If my assumption were true, and every explicit (cli given) option would 
overwrite implicitly given ones (i.e. configured options), wouldn't

  * git -c pull.ff=only pull, do a fast-forward (or merge)
  * git -c pull.ff=only pull --merge, force a merge commit
  * git -c pull.ff=only pull --rebase, force rebase
