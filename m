I think also the issue with this sentence is that its thought isn't
complete until also reading the next one. These can be combined to
get to the point faster.

Thanks for pushing for a more helpful message. I'm currently thinking
that the core issue is that the working directory has contents (files
or directories) that disagree with the sparse-checkout definition. I
will update the language in v2 to point the user in the direction of
comparing the two.

Thanks,
