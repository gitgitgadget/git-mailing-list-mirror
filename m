Thanks.

Maybe the user hits here because he's doing "branch -d" and so I would
find a more clear suggestion: "branch -d foo -f".

Or to be more generic, not suggesting a command line but a description
that explains how to use "the force" ... :) sorry for the joke

Anyway, I think you mean to suggest a less destructive approach.  Which
is fine by me.

That's an interesting idea.  Maybe the hint becomes more informative
than a simple advice ...  maybe a more-verbose error is needed ...  just
thinking out loud ...

Thank you.
