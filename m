Very nice and obvious bug-fix made easy by the previous refactoring. :)

Yeah, format-patch has the same behavior (to encode when we see "=?").
So we know it is working. It is perhaps overkill in this case, since
there is not technically a valid encoded-word, and a smart parser would
be able to see that it should leave it alone. But it is probably better
to be slightly conservative in what we generate (and the "=?" token is
unlikely to come up in day-to-day usage).
