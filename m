Btw, I actually in many ways prefer the critical ones over the positive 
ones, which may be one reason I actually appreciate Dan Lyons even though 
obviously a lot of people don't. I find it interesting to see what the 
other side thinks, even if it's often something you know is wrong.

The fact is, journalists seldom get any tech story really right. If they 
did, they'd be technical people.  You can react to it two ways: either 
realize that some people see it that way (which can be illuminating - if 
only because you might realize that stories you _believed_ in might not 
be exactly true either) or just dismissing the story and the teller of the 
story.

Yeah, I even watch Fox news occasionally. 

I think the news stories that disagree with our own beliefs are often the 
ones that tell us the most. 

Admittedly, sometimes they just tell us that people are idiots ;)
