In hindsight, that is a terrible explanation. Here's what I have revised
this to:

  With corrected commit dates implemented, we no longer have to rely on
  commit date as a heuristic in paint_down_to_common().

  While using corrected commit dates Git walks nearly the same number of
  commits as commit date, the process is slower as for each comparision we
  have to access the commit-slab (for corrected committer date) instead of
  accessing struct member (for committer date).

  For example, the command `git merge-base v4.8 v4.9` on the linux
  repository walks 167468 commits, taking 0.135s for committer date and
  167496 commits, taking 0.157s for corrected committer date respectively.

  t6404-recursive-merge setups a unique repository where all commits have
  the same committer date without well-defined merge-base. As this has
  already caused problems (as noted in 859fdc0 (commit-graph: define
  GIT_TEST_COMMIT_GRAPH, 2018-08-29)).

  While running tests with GIT_TEST_COMMIT_GRAPH unset, we use committer
  date as a heuristic in paint_down_to_common(). 6404.1 'combined merge
  conflicts' merges commits in the order:
  - Merge C with B to form a intermediate commit.
  - Merge the intermediate commit with A.

  With GIT_TEST_COMMIT_GRAPH=1, we write a commit-graph and subsequently
  use the corrected committer date, which changes the order in which
  commits are merged:
  - Merge A with B to form a intermediate commit.
  - Merge the intermediate commit with C.

  While resulting repositories are equivalent, 6404.4 'virtual trees were
  processed' fails with GIT_TEST_COMMIT_GRAPH=1 as we are selecting
  different merge-bases and thus have different object ids for the
  intermediate commits.

  As this has already causes problems (as noted in 859fdc0 (commit-graph:
  define GIT_TEST_COMMIT_GRAPH, 2018-08-29)), we disable commit graph
  within t6404-recursive-merge.

The previous commit didn't need to walk the whole split commit-graph
chain. Because of how we are handling writing in a mixed generation data
chunk, if a layer has generation data chunk, all layers below it have a
generation data chunk as well.

So, there are two cases at hand:

- Topmost layer has generation data chunk, so we know all layers below
  it has generation data chunk and we can read values from it.
- Topmost layer does not have generation data chunk, so we know we can't
  read from generation data chunk.

Just checking the topmost layer suffices - modified the previous commit.

Then, this function is more or less the same as
`g->read_generation_data` that is, if we are reading from generation
data chunk, we are using corrected commit dates.

Mentioned in the commit message - we walk (nearly) the same number of
commits but take somewhat longer.

With the explanation in commit message, it's clear to see how using
corrected commit dates leads to an (incorrectly) failing test. Does it
still make sense to seperate them?
