Also, in all (?) other places we use "ours" and "theirs"; it looks like
git-am was a strange exception with "ours" and "his" (also, it was/is
inconsistent in using plural vs singular form).  Though perhaps it was
created before the terminology solidified...

As to why it was not noticed and not fixed: probably no-one worked
in this area, thus nobody noticed this (callee just don't care how the
parameter is named).

Instead of nebulous "fairness" (i.e., be unfair in other direction),
in my opinion it would be better to simply fix the issue, be consistent
and use common terminology.
