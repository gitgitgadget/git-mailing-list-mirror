I thought the point of "simple" was to be even more restrictive than
"upstream".

At any rate, your setup is sufficiently complicated that I think you'd
be better off adding a branch.X.pushRef feature (essentially a refspec
to be used just on branch X, though since the source side is implied,
it's really just a destination ref).
