I've got "joins corresponding histories" from original NAME section, so
it's likely to be good enough.

I was not sure about it myself, but it sounded as if it could be the
case that I might need to resolve the same conflicts again and again, as
changes are taken from some "divergence point" that is apparently fixed.

OTOH, "merge base" not only is well-defined term, but it also doesn't
sound as some fixed point in history.

That's were I took it from indeed, git-merge-base manual page. I wanted
things we mention to be discoverable.

"are applied" meant to be generic enough in this context to cover, say,
"-s ours" as well. Perhaps "are integrated" you suggest below, or "are
incorporated" that is already used in the beginning of DESCRIPTION, is
better indeed.

As for merge vs rebase (or cherry-pick), the only essential difference
for me is that merge applies net (cumulative, integrated) changes, while
rebase applies each change sequentially, one commit to another. Please
correct me if I'm wrong.

BTW, one can imagine "rebase" merge strategy: make a new chain of
commits on top of destination, then squash all that to get a new single
merge commit.

The problem is that at this point we need to cover other merge
strategies as well, so we can't writ the description as if 3-way merge
is the only strategy.

As it's "TRUE MERGE" section that mentions 3-way merge for the first
time, it'd be the natural place for the link, I think.

Yeah, but I've rather deleted it entirely in 6/6.
