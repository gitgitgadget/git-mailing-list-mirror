I wonder whether the OT thread discussion about branch annotation may have some value here. For some repositories I manage, I have received questions about whether there was some way to know that a branch in the clone was associated with a worktree "at any point in the past", which, once the worktree has been pruned, is not derivable in a formal computational sense - there may be specific conditions where it is. Perhaps, if that line of development moves forward, that we should considering annotating the worktree-created branch to help with our pruning process and to identify where the branch originated.

Just a thought.

Cheers,
Randall
