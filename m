With current implementation, Git checks second packet of the handshake
for version, and third packet for capabilities.  The "capabilities" or
"capabilities=" is entirely redundant; it is the position of packet
(it is the packet number) that matters.  At least for now.

The only thing that "version" in "version 2" and "capabilities"
in "capabilities: clean smudge" helps is self-describing of the protocol.

To really make use of them you would have to end handshake with flush
packet, and do a parsing: loop over every packet, and match known
patterns.  Well, perhaps with exception of known header: it doesn't
makes sense to have "version N" anywhere else than second packet,
and it doesn't makes sense to repeat it.

We also don't want to proliferate packets unnecessarily.  Each packet
is a bit (a tiny bit) of a performance hit.

We could, following the example of original per-file filter drivers.
It is as simple as starting writer using start_async(), as if we did
writing from Git in a child process.

Though that might be left for later (assuming that protocol is flexible
enough), as synchronous protocol (write, then read) is a bit simpler to
implement.

Providing size upfront can be a hint for filter or Git.  For example
HTTP provides Content-Length: header, though it is not strictly necessary.

The solution with stopping writing wouldn't work, I don't think.

Right, better to design and implement basic protocol, taking care that
it is extensible, and only then add to it.

All right.

Actually... couldn't filter driver register atexit() / signal handler
to do a clean exit, if it is needed?

I think it would be good idea (not necessary, but helpful), though
possibly not in such exacting detail.  Just why this one, one sentence
or more.

A pity.  Well, not your problem, anyway.

Better.

Sorry, I wasn't clear.  What I meant is if "<file> located in the
Git core repository" is the best way to refer to such files, and
if we could do better.

But I think it is all right as it is.

Later we might want to provide some example filter.<driver>.process
filters e.g. in contrib/.  But that's for the future.

This is better.
