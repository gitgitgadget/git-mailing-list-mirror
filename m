Hello fellow hackers,

as part of our course at the Software Engineering class at the Free
University of Berlin/Germany we are holding a survey and looking for
developers to participate.

Our research context is Free and Open Source Software with a focus on
(Distributed) Pair Programming[1]. We try to explore how familiar you
are with Pair Programming in itself, if you have tried to use Pair
Programming in one of your projects, which tools you are familiar with
for communication and (Distributed) Pair Programming and how well they
worked.

Please visit [2] to particpate in the survey. It will roughly take 10
minutes to complete it. The survey will be online for the next two weeks
and be closed on the 25th of June. By participating you will be able to
receive the raw data and the result of our survey.

Sorry for disturbing, we sincerly hope you will participate and
happy hacking
     Jordi, Sandor, Holger






[1] On Pair Programming two people constantly interact with each other.
One developer is playing the role of the driver who is repsonsible for
typing and the other developery is the observer responsible for  
obersving
the driver, spotting issues and looking ahead. The two roles can and
should be changed. On Distributed Pair Programming the two mates don't
sit at the same work place but have technical means to collaborate.
