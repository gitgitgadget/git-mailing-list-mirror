I'm on v5.6-rc7-188-g1b649e0bcae7, but I can't imagine it makes a big
difference.

Yeah. I wonder what the variance is between the 3 runs (assuming you're
using ./run and doing 3). I.e., is one run in the first set much faster
than the others, and we pick it as best-of-3.

I get similar numbers here. But I wouldn't expect much. We only have
~160k commits+trees in git.git, so the average chain length is ~2.5.

Pointing to uninitialized bits is fine according to the standard (and I
think that's what you're asking about for chapter and verse). But we
really do lie to container_of(). See remote.c, for example. In
make_remote(), we call hashmap_get() with a pointer to lookup_entry,
which is a bare "struct hashmap_entry". That should end up in
remotes_hash_cmp(), which unconditionally computes a pointer to a
"struct remote".

Now the hashmap_entry there is at the beginning of the struct, so the
offset is 0 and the two pointers are the same. So while the pointer's
type is incorrect, we didn't compute an invalid pointer value. And
traditionally the hashmap code required that it be at the front of the
containing struct, but that was loosened recently (and container_of
introduced) in 5efabc7ed9 (Merge branch 'ew/hashmap', 2019-10-15).

And grepping around, I don't see any cases where it's _not_ at the
beginning. So perhaps this is a problem waiting to bite us.

I'd prefer not to use a separate variable, as that requires giving it a
type. Perhaps:

  hashmap_entry_init(&e->ent, lookup_entry.hash);

which is used elsewhere is OK? That still assumes there's a hash field,
but I think hashmap has always been pretty up front about that (the real
sin in the original is assuming that nothing else needs to be
initialized).
