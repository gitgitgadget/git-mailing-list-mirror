The option that may work, if the tests that are currenting running until Sunday (sadly) fail miserably, is to use:

if [ `uname` = "NONSTOP_KERNEL" ]; then trap '' EXIT; fi

or perhaps to add a descriptive function along those lines. We have had two major operating system upgrades since the original case relating to ksh traps, so perhaps things might improve. Our baseline is that there are currently 6 breaks (t1308#23, t1405#52, t9001#31/106/107/134), most of which have been traced back to perl completion codes.

Cheers,
Randall
P.S. I am happy to explain why the tests perform the at the rate they do on the development machines I have, if anyone is interested, although dissertations might be involved ðŸ˜‰
