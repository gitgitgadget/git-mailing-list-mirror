Looks like Junio just posted such a patch in the other thread.

However, according to the unsetenv() manpage:

  Prior to glibc 2.2.2, unsetenv() was prototyped as returning void;
  more recent glibc versions follow the POSIX.1-compliant prototype
  shown in the SYNOPSIS.

So it is POSIX to return an int, but that gives us at least one platform
where unsetenv() returns void (or used to). glibc 2.2.2 is 2001-era, so
that may be old enough that we don't care. But it makes me wonder if
other older or obscure platforms will run into this.
