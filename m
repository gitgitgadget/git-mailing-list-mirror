This doesn't work, as explained to myself in this commit in a private
project I have where I tried this a while ago:

    I thought this was a bug:

        (
            rm -rf /tmp/git &&
            git init /tmp/git &&
            cd /tmp/git >/dev/null &&
            echo '*' >.gitignore &&
            echo '!*.txt' >>.gitignore &&
            echo '!.gitignore' >>.gitignore &&
            touch foo.png foo.txt &&
            mkdir dir &&
            touch dir/bar.png dir/bar.txt &&
            git add *.txt &&
            git add */*.txt;
            git status --short
        )

    But it's a limitation, gitignore(5) says:

        It is not possible to re-include a file if a parent directory of
        that file is excluded. Git doesnâ€™t list excluded directories for
        performance reasons, so any patterns on contained files have no
        effect, no matter where they are defined.

    So as a hack exclude anything that looks like a file with an
    extension.

    1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
    .gitignore | 2 +-

    modified   .gitignore
    @@ -1,3 +1,3 @@
    -*
    +*.*
     !*.gpg
     !.gitignore

I.e. here I'm trying to maintain a repository where I only want
.gitignore and *.gpg files committed and everything else ignored, but it
only works for one directory level.

There's not a lot of room left in the gitignore syntax, but I suppose we
could extend it to add some "I really mean it" negative pattern which
would override previous patterns even if those previous patterns matched
directories.

Just fixing it as a bug would make the ignore process slower, since we
could no longer just ignore directories and would always need to
recursively scan them.
