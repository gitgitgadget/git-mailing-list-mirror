There are other approaches (special indices) that help reachability
queries beside "generation number".

By the way, what should happen if you add a replacement (in the git-replace
meaning) that creates a shortcut, therefore invalidating generation numbers,
at least in strict sense - committerdate as generation number would be still
good, I think?

Do Git use EWAH / EWOK bitmaps for reachability analysis, or is it still
limited to object counting?
