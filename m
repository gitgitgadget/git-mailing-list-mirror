That seems somewhat low, but maybe people just aren't that interested
in taking surveys.

This may have to do with advertising however. Have you contacted sites
like GitHub, Gitorious etc. asking them to advertise it? Is there
maybe a list of people that have been contacted somewhere?

I bet if we could get e.g. GitHub to advertise it in their regular
news distribution system we could raise that number of 5000
respondents significantly.
