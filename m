This issue has been around for years.  The discussion that led to
Debian setting this option may be helpful in understanding it:

http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=10494

A brief time line:

11 Jun 1997 The issue was reported to Debian.
20 Nov 1999 Chet Ramey remarks that bash's default will not change.
 4 Sep 2004 Debian sets DONT_REPORT_SIGPIPE.

Chet Ramey claims that setting DONT_REPORT_SIGPIPE by default
would make bash incompatible with every other shell out there.
Interestingly, all the non-bash shells that I've tried disagree
with him.

Cheers,
