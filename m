Really most of these ought to be in the repository struct anyway, I
would think. The value of ignore_case comes from core.ignorecase, which
is going to be repository-specific. We are probably doing the wrong
thing already by looking at the parent core.ignorecase value when
operating in an in-process submodule, but nobody noticed because it's
quite unlikely for a submodule to have a different setting than the
parent.
