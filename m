Yes, I was hoping to be able to simplify and/or speed up
__git_ps1() with this data.  "Namespacing" the branch data
here.  And then later add the state data (in a merge,
in a rebase, and etc.) in a series of "# state.*" headers.
And so on, until we get everything that __git_ps1() needs.
However, to really make that work, we might want to add
a --no-scan (or minimial scan) option, to just return the
header data, since __git_ps1() doesn't care about the list
of changes.

Thanks.

As far as I could tell, unmerged rename conflicts appear with a single
filename.

When I did a divergent rename (in both branches), merge creates
     a stage-1 "DD" entry,
     a stage-2 "AU" entry, and
     a stage-3 with a "UA" entry.
     Status reports it as 3 rows.

When I did a rename in one branch and an edits in both, merge
creates: either a "DU" or "UD" conflict (depending on the direction
of the merge).

Given that the index is ordered and accessed by path (and there is
no pathname field in a cache entry to link it to a different one),
I have to say that this is true.

I put a note in the code about it reporting the last entry at each
stage that are present in the index, but I'm not sure about how much
we want to say here.

If octopus finds conflicts, the worktree will probably be in a
funky state anyway.

With the unique prefix character it shouldn't matter.  I do print
all the '?' lines first then all the '!' lines, so the manpage
could be clarified if we wanted. I was just trying to save another
paragraph in the manpage.

I was probably inconsistent, I think it should be "c-quoted" (with the
hypen) providing we like this term.

Each of the git-diff*.txt and diff-format.txt files talk about
this quoting scheme, but none give it an explicit name.

Yes.  Let me try to clarify that in the manpage.
