Glibc will get a way to enable 64-bit time_t on 32-bit platforms 
eventually (https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/Y2038ProofnessDesign). 
Can platforms that won't provide a 64-bit time_t by 2038 be actually 
used at that point?  How would we get time information on them?  How 
would a custom timestamp_t help us?

Regarding the need for knobs: We could let the compiler chose between 
strtoll() and strtol() based on the size of time_t, in an inline 
function.  The maximum value can be calculated using its size as well. 
And we could use PRIdMAX and cast to intmax_t for printing.
