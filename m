Yeah, I think it may simply come down to that. I think we may need to
get some guidance from Conservancy on the best route forward. I.e., if
we want to bless "Git Cola" as a name, are we best to have some kind of
written agreement, so it is "we explicitly allow this", and is not
interpreted as "we did not bother to enforce, which weakens our
trademark".
