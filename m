Oh, yes, there it is. (I had skimmed the log for master..next but had
missed it---I guess that I also searched for "glob" instead of
"wildcard" didn't help).

Anyway, yes, the description of the new stuff there looks very
interesting, and I'll maybe I'll start running from next a bit to see
how this stuff all works.

I guess the big reason I wrote was that I was surprised to see your
reply instructing Sean on how to update the config file without also
saying something like, "by the way, this need to update the config
file like this will be going away with new work on git-clone that is
being done now and is expected to be in the upcoming git 1.5".

I thought that was the case, but didn't want to say it without
confirming it first. Thanks for confirming it for me.
