I agree with all your points about using hex and pushing the logic into
test-oidmap.c. BUT.

At the point where we are normalizing byte order of the hashes, I have
to wonder: why do we care about testing the hash value in the first
place? We care that oidmap can store and retrieve values, and that it
performs well. But as long as it does those things, I don't think
anybody cares if it uses the first 4 bytes of the sha1 or the last 4.

I know there are testing philosophies that go to this level of white-box
testing, but I don't think we usually do in Git. A unit test of oidmap's
externally visible behavior seems like the right level to me.
