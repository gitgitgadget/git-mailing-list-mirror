I think that this's not an issue, because a shared index file is not
for forever, but it's expected that a new shared index is written
every once in a while anyway, see splitIndex.maxPercentChange.  So
whenever sparse index gets enabled/disabled we could just write a new
shared index accordingly.  Maybe even when the sparse patterns change,
if necessary.

I'm not quite up-to-date in sparse index terminology, so I'm not sure
that this means...  but as mentioned above we can just write a new
shared index when deemed necessary.

Yeah, I think that in general there is more to be gained with sparse
index than with split index, though the split index might further
reduce the write time of a sparse index, because the amount of data
written is proportional with the nr of changed files instead of the nr
of all files in the sparse index.  I'm not sure that it's worth it,
either.

My remarks about compatibility primarily stem from your remarks about
compatibility in response to my sparse vs. split test failure report
in:

  https://public-inbox.org/git/48e9c3d6-407a-1843-2d91-22112410e3f8@gmail.com/

  "the sparse-index is (currently) incompatible with the split-index"

I assumed that that "(currently)" implies that eventually the two will
be made compatible.

Anyway, I'm fine with leaving them incompatible, but 'git
sparse-checkout' should still learn about split index, so it won't
pretend to succeed after it couldn't do what it was asked to when
there is a split index.  Maybe vice-versa as well.

Oh, no :)  The test 'cone mode clears ignored subdirectories' added in
that patch series (as in 'seen', so not the newes version) fails with
the working GIT_TEST_SPLIT_INDEX=1 as well, and I don't immediately
see why, as it doesn't seem to use sparse index.
