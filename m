I'm not opposed to this, as it's easy to do (though I suspect new calls
may be introduced that violate it).

But if we really are worried about the performance of st_mult(), I
think:

  static inline size_t st_mult(size_t a, size_t b)
  {
	size_t result;
	if (!__builtin_mul_overflow(a, b, &result))
		die("whoops!");
	return result;
  }

is the right direction. I just haven't gotten around to producing a
polished patch.

I didn't look at all of the calls, but I wonder if it is a natural
pattern to put the constant second.  Since multiplication is
commutative, it would be correct for st_mult() to just flip the order of
arguments it feeds to unsigned_mult_overflows().

That may introduce the same inefficiency in other callsites, but I
wonder if it would be fewer.
