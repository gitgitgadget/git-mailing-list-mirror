Here are a few additional last-minute logistics:

The remote connection will be done via Zoom, using this URL which will
become active shortly before 10:00am (Brussels time):

  https://github.zoom.us/j/186903655

You may need to download an app or other software; solutions are
available for most platforms, and the zoom site should guide you.

Note that this is _not_ configured as a one-way webinar. It's a real
video-conference where joiners can participate in the discussion. So
spectators from the community are OK, but please leave your camera/mic
off if you're not actively participating.

There will be outlets for charging laptops, but probably only about half
as many as there are people. So plan accordingly.

This is indeed happening, and is open to all Git Merge attendees.
Details should have been emailed out to the email address you registered
with. Note that they're asking people to RSVP through a web link. Please
do so if you're planning on coming!

See everybody tomorrow at 9:00am.
