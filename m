What now? :o

There's a lot of things it could be better at, but a more
concrete idea of what you want would help.

Right now I only have enough resources to do bugfixes along with scalability
and performance improvements so more people can run it and keep
it 100% reproducible and centralization resistant.

I'm also planning on some local tooling along the lines of
notmuch/mairix which is NNTP/HTTPS-aware but not sure when I'll
be able to do that...
