My thanks to everyone for the excellent feedback!  You've made some  
great points and I will try to incorporate them all during this week.   
I'll post to the list when a final version is available.

In the meantime, if you haven't sent edits yet, please do.  I'm not  
sure if this tutorial should grow any further, or if -- as someone  
suggested -- I should just add a springboard note at the end linking  
to other articles, which do a fine job of introducing the user to  
typical usage scenarios.  I guess it can't quite be called a  
"tutorial" if it never mentions the "clone" command.  Perhaps calling  
it a "design intro" or "meta-tutorial" would be better.

John
