Hi!
Mikael Magnusson:

Your mail came out weird without line-breaks here, trying to recover
your comments... :-)

English often skips the "the" to make the text smaller, but it looks
strange in Swedish (see the tp-sv list archives for various discussions
about this).

Ah, yes.

That is back to the -ande form. It's not wrong, per se, it just doesn't
look that good (IMHO at least).

 I think?

Yeah.
