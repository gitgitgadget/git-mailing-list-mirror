commit

Dear All,
I have created a git repository, and then I have deleted by error some =
files with rm -rf .
Now the files have disappeared from the hard disk, I am desperately loo=
king on how to restore them. The objects folder is full of dangling obj=
ects, but I do not know how to recover them.

Please help me
