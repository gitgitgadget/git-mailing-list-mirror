While calling someone out like this is not the right thing at all, it is 
a good opportunity for some introspection. I do not participate in the 
threads you do so I can't say much about these "never-ending, pointless 
rant threads". But if enough people feel this way, maybe you need to 
dial it down a bit. The community needs to do its part in making you and 
everyone else feel welcome. At the same time you need to do your part in 
making contributors, especially the new ones, feel welcome and 
appreciated. Being overly critical can turn developers away from the 
project.

Anyway, those are my 2 cents. Do with them what you will.
