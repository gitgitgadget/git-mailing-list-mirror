I miss a question about developer and mailing list attitude.  That is
often inversely proportional to the quality of help and support: one
has forums where lots of friendly people without much of a clue hang
out, and then there are some where one can always get competent and
fast help in one package with an ulcer.

The German TeX Usenet group has sort of a renown for that.  It has an
expert quota quite unusual for a Usenet group, but it is obvious that
some visitors use it mostly as a last resort when everything else
fails.  It is not that the tone there is actually acrimonious, but it
can be somewhat dry.
