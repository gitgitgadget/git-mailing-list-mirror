This description of the behavior is misleading (actually, actively
wrong). Shells are not somehow inferring that the space is part of the
redirect filename. The missing piece is that the following all behave
the same:

    echo foo bar >cow
    echo >cow foo bar
    echo foo >cow bar

That is, they all create a file named "cow" with content "foo bar".
So, in your example:

    echo space >/foo/t/trash directory.t7005-editor/.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG

what is actually happening is that it is creating a file named
"/foo/t/trash" with content "space
directory.t7005-editor/.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG".

As for the "ambiguous redirect" diagnostic, that seems to be Bash
trying to be helpful in reporting what is likely a programming error
(that is, forgetting to double-quote the expansion).
