Vim and Emacs has, and have had tools suitable for C and other language=
s
for ages. If you have learned to master them it's hard to find anything=
 as
good. If you do java the tools in vim and emacs are not as developed as
those for older languages, which Eclipse is originally developed as a t=
ool
for Java development and it shines at it. For non-java things vary. The=
 C/C++
support in Eclipse is getting better, but it' nowhere near what exists
for Java. Learning and avoiding its's  bugs and quirks is probably not
worth it if you already have other good or better tools.=20

VIM and Emacs are really IDE's. In particular you can login to emacs di=
rectly
and never leave it until you log out. Besdides all you pogramming tools=
 you
have your email and (yes) your mp3 player there. That's pretty integrat=
ed to me.
