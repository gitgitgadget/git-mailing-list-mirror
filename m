it depends on how it gets sent out.

if it's just sent to the git lists you won't have many of those users, if 
it's sent to lists of projects that use git (and/or publicised in the 
newsletters of those projects) we'll get a lot more of them.

due to the concern abot spamming too many lists, I'd suggest getting in 
contact with the project leaders and see what they would like or not like. 
I suspect that many of them will be happy to have the survey go out to 
their users so that git can improve based on the feedback and their users 
can think less about git and more about their project ;-)

if most of the project leaders are willing or eager to get the info out 
it seems reasonable to go ahead and send a single message out to the other 
lists, but if a lot of them are opposed, definantly don't send it anywhere 
you didn't get a response.
