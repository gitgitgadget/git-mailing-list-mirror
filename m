Is the intent to remove this compile-time flag before this is merged? 
With it off by default in builds, the audience for this is limited to 
those who build their own/custom versions of git. I can see other 
organizations wanting to use this that don't have a custom fork of git 
they build and install on their users machines.

Like the GIT_TRACE mechanism today, I think this should be compiled in 
but turned off via the default settings by default.

While it makes sense to have clear goals in the design document, the 
motivation and background sections feel somehow out of place.  I'd 
recommend you clearly articulate the design goals and drop the 
background data that led you to the goals.

nit - I'd move this "Note:" section to the end of your "A Quick 
Example." While it's good to understand about pretty printing, its not 
the first or most important thing.

At first glance, the SLOG configuration settings seem out of place but 
I'll read on to see why they are needed with every cmd_exit event...

I'm assuming the sid is what will enable correlating the child process

But it does make me wonder if we need to keep both systems.  If there 
are two, as a developer I need to know which I should use.  What is the 
criteria I should use to decide between adding GIT_TRACE and SLOG 
tracing?  It seems like it would be best if we could converge on a 
single tracing model.

Is SLOG a superset of GIT_TRACE? If not, could it be?  While SLOG can't 
be smashed into GIT_TRACE, can the functionality of GIT_TRACE be 
subsumed by SLOG so that we can converge on a single tracing system?

I'd like to see a design goal for this effort to be that we come up with 
a single tracing mechanism that meets _all_ the requirements (including 
those currently met by GIT_TRACE).

The sub-command definition seems a little squishy but I guess since you
have the entire set of command line arguments, it's really just a hint
as you could always drop back to looking at the arguments yourself.

Hmm, couldn't this (a new "Trace Detail Event) be used to help replace 
the existing GIT_TRACE mechanism? I think one missing piece is a 
formatting option other than "pretty." Perhaps another field that is a 
format string that can be used to give it a richer human readable output?

Overall this looks very robust and capable.  Clearly my biggest feedback 
is that I'd like to see this be able to replace the existing GIT_TRACE 
and GIT_TRACE_PERFORMANCE support.  Having two different mechanisms 
seems unnecessarily complex and will increase the mental burden when 
adding tracing.  It also doubles the code we need to 
write/debug/document/support.  I'd hate to see callers of the tracing 
code having to double up and including calls to both tracing mechanisms.

I'm OK if this is a goal and migrating the existing calls to GIT_TRACE 
are cleaned up over time.  It may be a nice intermediate step if the 
existing macros could be re-implemented to sit on top of the new SLOG 
infrastructure. This would certainly make it easier to migrate the code 
base over time.
