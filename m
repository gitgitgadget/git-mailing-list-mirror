In the output generated by diff --word-diff, if the first word of a line was
removed, it may appear at the end of the previous line. For example, compare
the following two diffs on the same files, the first diff without --word-diff
and the second with it.


$ git diff

I would expect every [-111-] to be on the line where it was removed. Instead
it appears on the previous line in the case where the previous line also has a
removal.

Is this expected behavior?

There is also a patch in this email thread that contains a test to further
illustrate the issue. Running the test fails with the following diff between
the expected result and actual result.
