Thanks for confirming. My "I am not clear how these should interact" was
really "this does not make any sense to me" in my head, but I was afraid
that I was missing something. The fact that we document explicitly that
-L should not be combined with pathspecs makes that much more obvious.

Agreed.

On our side, I don't think it would be _wrong_ to catch and disallow the
combination. But it may be nicer to them if we continue to quietly
ignore --follow and the pathspec in that case, for working with older
versions. (OTOH, if I understand correctly they're segfaulting every
time VS Code is used with v2.29 now, so they may have to accept it as an
urgent fix anyway).
