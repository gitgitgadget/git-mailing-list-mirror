Yes, you didn't write "restore" but you wrote: "It updates the named
paths in the working tree from the index file or from a named <tree-ish> 
(most often a commit)."

I suppose that from reading this, some people will assume that `d` is
gone after the command was executed because the folder to which the
given path leads is updated "in the working tree from the index file or
from a named <tree-ish>", and others will not be sure what happens. But
I doubt that a lot of people guess the behavior correctly and are sure
about them being correct.

Note that for the first group of people, it doesn't matter that git
doesn't track folders. You can restore a folder "in the working tree
from the index file or from a named <tree-ish>" without tracking folders
because there only is one property of a folder git cares about, apart
from it itself being able to access files in that folder: Its name. And
it can get that name from the paths of the files in that folder. If
there are no files in that folder, there isn't a contradiction, either,
because then there is no folder in the index or tree-ish which can
possibly be restored.

Exactly.Â "grab all paths that match <pathspec> out of <tree>, add them
to the index and copy them out to the working tree" is a more accurate
description of what the command does (but it might need some rewording
;-) ).
