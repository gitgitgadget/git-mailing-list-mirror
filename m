I created a project account for StGIT at
https://gna.org/projects/stgit (the homepage is still
www.procode.org/stgit/) to make bugs/tasks submitting and tracking
easier. I already added the tasks I'm planning to do before a 1.0
release but more will be added, including some of the already reported
bugs. I'll also update the homepage and wiki to point to this location
for submitting bugs/wishes.

For the regular contributors to StGIT, let me know if you'd like to be
added to the project members list.

Regards.
