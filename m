This patch series came in via the Git for Windows fork
[https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/3487], and I intend to merge it
before v2.34.0-rc0, therefore I appreciate every careful review you gentle
people can spare.

The x86_64 variant of Windows uses the LLP64 data model, where the long data
type is 32-bit. This is very different from the LP64 data model used e.g. by
x86_64 Linux, where unsigned long is 64-bit.

Most notably, this means that sizeof(unsigned long) != sizeof(size_t) in
general.

However, since Git was born in the Linux ecosystem, where that inequality
does not hold true, it is understandable that unsigned long is used in many
code locations where size_t should have been used. As a consequence, quite a
few things are broken e.g. on Windows, when it comes to 4GB file contents or
larger.

Using Git LFS [https://git-lfs.github.io/] trying to work around such issues
is one such a broken scenario. You cannot git checkout, say, 5GB files. Huge
files will be truncated to whatever the file size is modulo 4GB (in the case
of a 5GB file, it would be truncated to 1GB).

This patch series primarily fixes the Git LFS scenario, by allowing clean
filters to accept 5GB files, and by allowing smudge filters to produce 5GB
files.

The much larger project to teach Git to use size_t instead of unsigned long
in all the appropriate places is hardly scratched by this patch series.

Side note: The fix for the clean filter included in this series does not
actually affect Git LFS! The reason is that Git LFS marks its filter as
required, and therefore Git streams the file contents to Git LFS via a file
descriptor (which is unaffected by LLP64). A "clean" filter that is not
marked as required, however, lets Git take the code path that is fixed by
this patch series.

Changes since v3:

 * The commit message of the fourth patch no longer talks about a "workdir"
   but about the "working tree".
 * The smudge filter test case is now more precise when verifying the
   result's file size.

Changes since v2:

 * The test cases now use a prereq to avoid running in 32-bit setups (where
   they would be guaranteed to fail).
 * The SIZE_T_IS64BIT prereq specifically does not follow LONG_IS_64BIT, by
   testing for exactly 64 bits.
 * The code comment above unsigned_left_shift_overflows() was fixed.
 * unsigned_left_shift_overflows() now verifies that shift is smaller than
   the bit size of the operand.
 * genzeros now marks its buffer of NULs as const.
 * The error check in the infinite loop genzeros was fixed.

Changes since v1:

 * Removed extraneous "Signed-off-by:" lines from "git-compat-util:
   introduce more size_t helpers".
 * Integrated Carlo's patch to allow genzeros to generate large amounts of
   NULs, even in LLP64 data models.
 * Using test-tool genzeros instead of dd if=/dev/zero, to help HP NonStop
   (which appears to use the LP64 data model and therefore should pass the
   new test cases even without the fixes provided in this patch series).
 * Accelerating genzeros to have performance characteristics similar to dd
   if=/dev/zero instead of being ~50x slower.
