I used "usefulness" in its general vague sense.  It is useful to be popular,
I don't make choices solely on that or I would be writing everything in
Java.

I'm talking about porcelain code and not core functionality which should
be left in C.  I'm saying that you should be free to provide Ruby
implementations of all such superstructure.  And the same can be done by
(but not required by) the Perl, Python, Tcl and even C, Haskel, Guile
and whatever communities.  Most such higher level code is fairly
trivial, and if the file names are kept the same, the same test
procedures could be run.

I don't think the cost of duplication of code functionality is that
significant, since it would bring new people to the project.  After all
this is a free project and not a commerical venture.  It certainly helps
porting to new platforms.  Separate language communities would be
maintaining their own contributions, with their own experimental
directories.

Translating the same functionality to multiple languages requires
careful reading which can help identify some hidden bugs.
