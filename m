I can only suggest, from other OpenSource projects I'm on, that make extensive use of macros, that they are very difficult to debug and sometimes harder to integrate with platform-specific compatibility layers.  I would rather have something explicit in compat.c that gdb could make sense of during a debug session if necessary. Trying to debug macros is harsh, rather like debugging -O2 without -g.

I used to be a big fan of macros, but grew out of it ðŸ˜‰. Just my take on it.
