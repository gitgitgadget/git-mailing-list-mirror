I feel horribly that I've had this patch series sitting in my review
backlog for months and haven't gotten to it yet, especially because I
have such an interest in these patches and know that much care was taken
to prepare them.

I read through these patches over some coffee today at a cursory level.
The high-level approach makes sense to me, and the implementation looks
solid. I think that anything that does come up (see below) can be
addressed in 'next' rather than waiting longer on this series.

For what it's worth, I'm planning on starting to test this series in
some of our testing repositories at GitHub, and I'll report back on our
experience with some notes (and patches) should anything come up.

That would be my preference, too.

I noticed a few small things (mostly a couple of typos and other very
minor details). But, I'd much rather build on top of this series once it
has landed in 'next' than go to a fifth re-roll since there are many
patches involved.

I also noticed that you have already sent some patches in a separate
series that are based on this one, which would apply cleanly if this
series is merged into next.

I figure that this will also be helpful as I send some patches about
extra 'commit-graph write' options out of GitHub's fork, since they will
inevitably create merge conflicts if we both are targeting 'next'. So,
I figure that this approach will ease some maintainer burden ;-).
