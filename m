Hmm. Sometimes these big "context" objects are hard to make const,
because we end up using them to hold or pass state between functions
(e.g., see diff_options). So I'd worry slightly that we'll end up
un-consting this in the long run.

That being said, it is easy to revert, and it provides some small
benefit, so I don't mind it in the meantime.
