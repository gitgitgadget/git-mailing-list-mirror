I don't disagree, but I can't come up with a better name either.
maxNewChangedPaths? maxNewSomething? I don't know. Usually I think
exposing this sort of detail is smelly, but I'm not so bothered by it
here. Similarly, this thread has been around for a while, and nobody
else has suggested a better name, so, I'm inclined to keep it.

OK, sure.

I'm trying to say that there is room for us to improve when we do and
don't recompute filters when the limit on the number of changed paths
deviates between layers, but that such deviations don't currently exist
in the wild.

Bugs are another thing, but we can't tell that they exist without
recomputing every filter.

Thanks,
Taylor
