That doesn't surprise me. I didn't look very hard, but mostly just did
the minimum to see if it would work (and it didn't).

It could perhaps be overcome, and I certainly don't mind if you want to
dig further, but I'm happy enough with the hashmap solution.

Right, I meant the comment no longer applies in the patch below, because
we're not using a pointer type anymore.

Yeah, agreed this is another weakness of this approach.

Agreed.
