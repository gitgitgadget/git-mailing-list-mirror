Yeah, I agree that the current system is not quite flexible enough. And
there is some prior art already in /etc/gitattributes, which we respect
in addition to core.attributesFile.

I did wonder briefly if we could let core.excludesFile be a multi-valued
list (so you could add a user one on top of the system value). But that
would break backwards compatibility for people who expect the current
last-one-wins behavior. And also would interact weirdly with the XDG
fallback, as you noted.

So I think it is reasonable to add a system-level version of gitignore.
I'm not sure how often it would be used, but it certainly fills a gap
and would make it consistent with config and attributes files. You can
grep for ETC_GITATTRIBUTES to see how the attributes version is
configured and used.

PS If you want to get really wild, consider this: the exclude/ignore
   feature is really just a proper subset of the attributes system that
   came later. If we were designing today, we could ditch .gitignore
   entirely in favor of a special "ignored" attribute, and then you
   could just use /etc/gitattributes to do what you want.

   I'm not sure if people would find that more syntactically awkward; it
   is nice that you can just dump files one per line into .gitignore
   without special syntax. But it's possible that we could provide
   _both_ mechanisms, and let the user do whichever they find easier.

   That's obviously a much bigger project than just adding an
   /etc/gitignore file, though. :)
