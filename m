I don't know who "you guys" is, but it would be my guess that
Stallman/FSF would not be enthused to see the Emacs logo added to that
particular list.

Emacs used Bzr particularly to promote an alternative to Git more open
to the free software philosophy promoted by the FSF.  Once Bzr
development became non-responsive and Canonical turned it more into a
Canonical-owned rather than a community project, it became sort of
pointless to stick with a technically less popular choice.

So Emacs fairly recently switched to Git.

So it's sort of a screaming and kicking endorsement.  Some people would
claim that those are the best, but it does not really fit well with the
spirit of this front page.

Where is the point if they don't see how or in what scale?

Uh no, it doesn't.  "Uses $x" does not constitute participation.
