I agree wholeheartedly with these points.

To begin with I wasn't clear that REG_STARDEND being nonstandard was
even noticed or compatibility considered when adding the dependency on
it, but it seems such discussion did take place and most targets have
it. Perhaps this means it should be proposed for standardization in
the next issue of POSIX.

On Linux page-size (mmap granularity) varies by arch but it's 4k on
basically all archs that people care about. I think midipix's author
was talking about real page size on Windows (4k) vs the minimum
logical page size (mmap granularity) that can be used to get
POSIX-matching semantics in midipix (which is 64k due to some
technical reasons I forget, which he could probably remind me of).
