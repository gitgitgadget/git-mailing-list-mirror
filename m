Hi,
  
  This is qgit, basically a porting of gitk to Qt/C++.

Has mainly all the features of gitk, some differences
are an uglier graph and a quick start alghoritm that
doesn't use git-rev-tree.

Just run make, install the bin anywhere in the path
and run from any git project working directory to see
the graph

Should be quite friendly to use; just go
(double)clicking around.


Download link is:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=139897&package_id=153471&release_id=331341

Home page:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/qgit/

Hope you enjoy it
Marco Costalba
