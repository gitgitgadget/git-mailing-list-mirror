That sounds mostly like a bug in the mail client you are using.  K-9
Mail for instance allows for this.  I'd report the lack of plain text to
your e-mail client provider, I.E. Google.

Not to be snarky or anything, but the "contemporary" thing these days is
to use forums and twitter, which really don't make good development arenas.

That is a war that the side of "good" will ultimately lose at though,
SPAM will win no matter what we do, we just have to hold off as much as
we can.

Asking on the list isn't going to be all that helpful, if for no other
reason than the actual list administrators aren't on it.  My guess is
that the answer is going to be 'no' or to use a mail client that
properly supports plain-text, like K-9 for instance.

That said I've CC'ed postmaster so that your concerns are actually seen
by the people who might be able to help you, or at least explain the
reasons behind what's going on better.
