I would love to participate, but I won't be able to spend as much time
as I did last year.

We always have mixed feelings on the actual outcome of GSoC, but I think
it's a really good thing on overall for the community (Git's, and more
generally "FLOSS") to encourrage young developers to participate.

I second that. As a mentor, the work I should have done during the first
few days was already done indeed. It also helped dropping non-spammy
candidates: selecting on the quality of interaction during microproject
is better than judging only on resume+proposal.
