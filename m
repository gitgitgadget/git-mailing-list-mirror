OK, so in short, renormalizing three blobs in the conflicted index
is done correcte because you do not allow safer-crlf kicks in during
the renormalization?

So how does ce_compare_data() judge "first line\r\nsame line\r\n"
in stage #2 and working tree (both with CRLF) not to match?  The
CRLF in working tree data, when run convert_to_git(), will be kept
as CRLF because of safer-crlf rule, and would match, no?  Or do you
disable safer-crlf for that case, too?

OK.

OK, I misunderstood what you are trying to fix.  I somehow thought
that you wanted to tweak the renormalization of three blobs.

That makes sense.

But it is unclear to me how that need an extra "no, do not look at
the indexed blob, but look at this blob instead"?

The relevant part is this:

diff --git a/read-cache.c b/read-cache.c
index a3ef967..c109b6d 100644
--- a/read-cache.c
+++ b/read-cache.c
@@ -163,7 +163,9 @@ static int ce_compare_data(const struct cache_entry *ce, struct stat *st)
 
 	if (fd >= 0) {
 		unsigned char sha1[20];
-		if (!index_fd(sha1, fd, st, OBJ_BLOB, ce->name, 0))
+		unsigned flags = HASH_USE_SHA_NOT_PATH;
+		memcpy(sha1, ce->sha1, sizeof(sha1));
+		if (!index_fd(sha1, fd, st, OBJ_BLOB, ce->name, flags))
 			match = hashcmp(sha1, ce->sha1);
 		/* index_fd() closed the file descriptor already */
 	}

I do not quite see how "Don't use ce->sha1, but use sha1 given to
you" flag affects this call, when sha1 and ce->sha1 are the same due
to memcpy() just before the call?
