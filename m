=46irst, let me extend my thanks for a great version control tool. Git =
has enhanced my productivity tremendously - I appreciate the Git team's=
 focus on performance, usability, and correctness. Awesome work.

I've used git in several jobs now and keep coming back to _really_ wish=
ing I could attach a description to some of my branches. Working on a w=
ide range of topics/branches from week to week and project to project, =
it's sometimes difficult to quickly remember what each branch is about,=
 without doing a git diff master <branch>. =A0I like to keep branch nam=
es short so they're easy to switch to and from, but being able to attac=
h a description that would display when doing a "git branch" would be a=
 huge help.

My only intention with this email is to say "thanks" and put in a vote =
for git branch descriptions.
