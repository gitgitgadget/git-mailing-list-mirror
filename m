[Junio: sorry for the duplicate message. It occured to me too late

But perhaps more important for my meaning is that by "that phrase" I
meant the phrase "substantive noun". I meant that "output" is a sort
of fluid substance and so is rarely supposed to be plural unless
outputs with different qualities are being discussed, but the phrase
"substantive noun" conveys none of that at all. In fact, I think the
phrase "substantive noun" just means "noun". Hence my dismay at not
making any sense.

Sorry about the confusion.

Jonathan
