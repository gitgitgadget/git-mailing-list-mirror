Relax!  This is just a joke.  Or is it?

Fast-forward a few years (the fewer the better) to
the time when gnu/linux is the dominant operating
system in the world.  [For lawyers, 'the world' means
the USA, of course, where everyone is born a victim
and must be programmed to honor and welcome his fate!]

Now, when Micro$oft (eventually) takes its (natural)
place as a loser in the marketplace -- who will the
lawyers be anxious to sue?

Any and all reassurance will be most welcome :o)
