I'm very sorry for you, but I, for one, refuse to let decisions be 
influenced by people who did not have so much as a glimpse in the 
documentation.

It may be okay for a certain nation state to award people spilling that 
hot coffee that they ordered over there laps, but the rest of the world 
laughs about such a behaviour.

If you got rope, stuck your neck through the noose, and jumped, without 
reading the manual first, well, that's not my problem.

But I guess that we'll get that no-default-action behaviour, and I will 
have to change my ways.  Sigh.

Ciao,
Dscho
