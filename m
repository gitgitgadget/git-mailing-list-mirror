I usually hate to "me too", but I really want to second this notion. We
have been getting minor documentation fixups trickling in, and I think
those really help, and maybe they eventually would make the
documentation perfect. But I have the feeling we would benefit from
somebody taking ownership and considering the big picture of how the
documentation fits together, and then really pushing it forward with
something concrete.
