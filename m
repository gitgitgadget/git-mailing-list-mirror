Agree.

Perfectly valid reasoning.

Initially I came from the situation where I (as maintainer of a 
repository) proposed to do a `git pull --ff-only <remote-git-url> 
<branch-name>` for the others to integrate the newest changes safely 
(i.e. failing if they had errouneously worked on that branch, which it 
is not intended for). I thought I could reach that safety with the 
`--ff-only` part, but it seems one of the devs had pull.rebase set for 
him locally and thus managed to bypass my "safety". Mr. Elijah Newren 
called this a bug, see [1].

Another way for the others to integrate my changes would be to propose a 
`git reset --hard ...` but that seems very... hard. It would overwrite 
all local changes (only recoverable by the reflog then, and you would 
even need to know that you had local changes in the first place).
