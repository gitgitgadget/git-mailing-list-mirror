Indeed this is a trade-off. My intention was to establish some kind of
well-known term by citing "core.quotePath" everywhere. So after a while
"quoting" and "core.quotePath" should be known by everyone interested.

On the other hand this makes every section quite long. Personally, I
find long and repetitive documentation harder to comprehend.
