Subject: git-bisect reset not deleting .git/BISECT_LOG
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Thank you for filling out a Git bug report!
Please answer the following questions to help us understand your issue.

What did you do before the bug happened? (Steps to reproduce your issue)
```bash
git init /tmp/reproduce-bisect-warning
cd /tmp/reproduce-bisect-warning
touch .git/BISECT_LOG
git bisect reset
git switch -c log
```

What did you expect to happen? (Expected behavior)

`git-bisect reset` should have deleted .git/BISECT_LOG

What happened instead? (Actual behavior)

.git/BISECT_LOG is still there

What's different between what you expected and what actually happened?

git switch and some external tools like shell prompts are relying on 
that file to know if we are doing a bisect so switch printed a warning 
that we are still bisecting. Funnily enough git checkout doesn't print 
that warning.

Anything else you want to add:

In case you are wondering why I created the .git/BISECT_LOG file with 
touch instead of using the git cli, I forgot how I ended up there in the 
first place that was like a year ago and the warning didn't really 
bother me, today someone told me to look for anything in .git namend 
BISECT* and after deleting the log by hand it worked. So I figured 
git-bisect reset should probably have done that after I ended up in that 
unkown state. the content I had in BISECT_LOG before deleting it was:
```
# good: [e24028141f2] qdmr: fixup
git bisect good e24028141f278590407dd5389330f23d01c89cff
```
