It's easy to make that assumption, but looking at the history it seems
the "actual" reason it exists is that it's vestigial from before the
subtree tests used test-lib.sh, and echoing it like that was the only
way you'd get feedback.

But it's been my experience that the tests are already impossible to
debug without passing `-x`, so everything from `check_equal` ends up
being just noise.

And also I figured if `test` is good enough for t9350-fast-export.sh,
then it's good enough for t7900-subtree.sh... after working with
subtree, I'd accidentally written a couple of the checks in one of my
fast-export patchsets using `check_equal`.  Being special makes things
harder to hack on.
