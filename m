By the way, from time to time I search blogs using either Technorati
searching for "http://git.or.cz", or Google Blog Search searching
either for "link:git.or.cz" or "Distributed Version Control".

BTW. funny thing that Google _Blog_ Search sometimes returns a host
of links to 'commit' view of gitweb... :-)

Well, if it is mainly as the place for "weekly links", it has some
purpose as it. And finding the links, perhaps with some minimal
reduction (removing duplicates and such), is much easier and takes
much less time than selecting "links of impact" for GitLinks page,
or selecting other page like BlogPosts, GitComparison, GitDocumentation
or InterfacesFrontendsAndTools git wiki page to add link to.

Ah, I didn't remember about it.

Still it looks more like "A git blog" than "Official git blog".

Yes, IMHO it is better name.

Well, I think that people would treat those collection of links as
collection of links to _sensible_ contents. So at least put such links
in the "Controversial" (or something like that) section.

I don't think so.

How it is about git?

Nice article, extending on article about Git support for Capistrano.
Worth reading, I think, at least for Rubyists (RnR) here...
