This confused me for a moment, as on my first read it seems like the
obvious solution is to normalize the input to a bit-field, like:

  revs->early_output = !!atoi(optarg);

But the "users still expect" bit was a bit subtle to me, as I thought
you meant users of Git. But you mean that the feature itself is not a
boolean, but rather an integer count of how much early output to show.

I'm not sure if I was just being thick or if that point (and the fact
that --early-output has basically been a noop since 2011!) should be
made more explicit.

Given that nobody noticed, I kind of wonder if we should consider
ripping the feature out entirely.
