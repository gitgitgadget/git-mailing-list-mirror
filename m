It has become clear, also in discussion on IRC, that your preferred
approach is to fight the fires, attempting to extinguish flames as they
happen.

My approach -- and in my perception also that preferred by most of the
regulars who have spoken in this whole mess -- is that since there is a
fire hazard, it would be more effective firefighting to just remove the
hazard, thus preventing future fires.

I infer that in your view, there is an inalienable right for the fire
hazard to remain part of the community that you are not willing to give
up.  I for one no longer have such qualms in this instance.
