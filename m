> Exactly, when we need to push we are asked about authentication. I li=
ke to configure the central git server in a way so that the user-name a=
s in authentication, be set as author name by the git server itself. ac=
tually it is how I configured svn server over http. So comparing to tha=
t I am trying to achieve the same. Say your user-name is there at htpas=
swd file as Carlos, so when you authenticate by Carlos to push , the au=
thor-name will automatically become as Carlos. No way to customize that=
 with specific username. That's the idea.
