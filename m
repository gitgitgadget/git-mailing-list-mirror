Heh. You're the "good tester" kind of person. Most people don't bother to 
explain their problems well, and don't even bother to listen. And they 
never call it "easy" if they had to get explanations.

I still hope the exchanges will result in more docs, or at least other 
lurkers on the list also learning a new trick or two..
