                      Eighth Real-Time Linux Workshop

                            October 12-15, 2006
                         Lanzhou University - SISE
                          Tianshui South Road 222
                           Lanzhou, Gansu 730000
                                 P.R.China


  General

   Following  the  meetings  of  developers  and  users at the previous 7
   successful  real-time Linux workshops held in Vienna, Orlando, Milano,
   Boston,  and  Valencia, Singapore, Lille, the Real-Time Linux Workshop
   for  2006  will  come back to Asia again, to be held at the School for
   Information  Science  and  Engineering, Lanzhou University, in Lanzhou
   China.

   Embedded  and  real-time Linux is rapidly gaining traction in the Asia
   Pacific  region.  Embedded  systems  in  both  automation/control  and
   entertainment moving to 32/64bit systems, opening the door for the use
   of  full  featured  OS  like  GNU/Linux  on  COTS  based systems. With
   real-time  capabilities being a common demand for embedded systems the
   soft  and  hard  real-time  variants are an important extension to the
   versatile GNU/Linux GPOS.

   Authors  are  invited  to  submit  original  work dealing with general
   topics  related  to  real-time  Linux  research,  experiments and case
   studies,  as  well  as issues of integration of real-time and embedded
   Linux.  A  special focus will be on industrial case studies. Topics of
   interest include, but are not limited to:

     * Modifications and variants of the GNU/Linux operating system
       extending its real-time capabilities,
     * Contributions to real-time Linux variants, drivers and extensions,
     * User-mode real-time concepts, implementation and experience,
     * Real-time Linux applications, in academia, research and industry,
     * Work in progress reports, covering recent developments,
     * Educational material on real-time Linux,
     * Tools for embedding Linux or real-time Linux and embedded
       real-time Linux applications,
     * RTOS core concepts, RT-safe synchronization mechanisms,
     * RT-safe interaction of RT and non RT components,
     * IPC mechanisms in RTOS,
     * Analysis and Benchmarking methods and results of 
       real-time GNU/Linux variants,
     * Debugging techniques and tools, both for code and temporal
       debugging of core RTOS components, drivers and real-time
       applications,
     * Real-time related extensions to development environments.
