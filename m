I am not sure that joining the SFC is going to make any difference with
respect to those things. Developers and distributors of the software in
the United States were already subject to such laws, and I don't see how
our dealing with the SFC would create any special obligation for those
outside the US. In particular, it seems to me that git as a legal entity
signing this agreement as the SFC (which legally is really just an
agreement between the SFC and a few members of the project) is different
from git as a community of individuals who happen to contribute and
distribute code.  SFC will not own any copyrights, nor take any
responsibility for distribution.

But I am not a lawyer, of course, and yes, this seems like exactly the
sort of thing we can ask them about. So I've cc'd Bradley. :)
