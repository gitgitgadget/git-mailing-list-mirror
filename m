I think I probably took this from the trace2 tests? Not sure. I'm glad
that it's not wrong, strictly speaking.

This is another instance that I'd be happy to send a follow-up patch to
get rid of all of these at once, unless you feel strongly that it should
be changed in this series before applying.

Yeah, this follows from a suggestion that Ã†var gave in:

  https://lore.kernel.org/git/878s8y5bdn.fsf@evledraar.gmail.com/

FWIW, I found that his suggestion was *clearer* than what was in v2. But
I get that others may feel differently, too.

Agreed on all of that.

Sure, I see what you're saying. To be honest, I'm skeptical that we'd
have a bug which failed only this one test, so I'm hesitant to send a
replacement/reroll for this alone.

If you feel strongly, though, I'm happy to change it. (But, I'll err on
the side of leaving it as-is, since you indicated in your response to
v3's cover letter that you'd be OK if I discarded some or all of your
suggestions).

Yay!
