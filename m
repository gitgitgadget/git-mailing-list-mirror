Just to be clear, nothing has any slots yet. We will get a bunch of
proposals (and yes, there are a _ton_ of libgit2 proposals), and then
the mentors as a group will rate them and decide which ones we want. And
then Google will tell us how many slots we get, and if we have more good
proposals than slots, we decide what to cut.

So libgit2 may get zero slots, but given the interest, I hope that it
will get something.

We could potentially spin libgit2 off as its own organization next year.
I've been surprised by how much student interest there is in it this
year.
