I have to agree: if the mail is adressed directly to me, I am much more 
likely to read it. So I am quite annoyed by answers to my emails, which 
do not have me in To: or Cc:.

Well, RFC 1855 "Netiquette guidelines" states in 2.1.2 "for mail:":

    - Watch cc's when replying.  Don't continue to include
      people if the messages have become a 2-way conversation.

(I myself am guilty of not culling people when no longer quoting them.)

The statement from the RFC obviously assumes that you reply to the author 
of the message (and since it came from a mailing list, if it is of 
interest to the list, you should Cc: that, too).

IMHO it is all to easy to filter duplicate messages, and generally not 
possible to identify replies to _your_ mails when the reply is not sent to 
_you_, but to the list.

IOW I agree with Junio.

Ciao,
Dscho
