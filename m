Looks sane overall, though somehow we added 4 extra lines while reducing
duplication. ;)

Would anyone ever pass anything except the global "anonymize" into this
function (certainly neither of the new callers does). I get that it
takes us on a possible road towards moving the globals to locals, but in
the meantime, shadowing the global name just seems more confusing to me.

This makes the output a bit more lego-like (i.e., hard to see what the
full line will look like from the code), but it already was pretty
bad because of using print_path(). I think that's fine.

This line gets repeated, too. I guess we could have a print_mark(), but
there is really no logic here except "put a colon in front of it", so
probably not worthwhile.
