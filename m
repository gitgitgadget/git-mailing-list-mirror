Yeah, it's definitely orthogonal to GÃ¡bor's patches.

I also wondered who might be using the feature. I assumed it was written
with gitk in mind. Digging in the list archive that seems to be the
case, and there was even an RFC patch for gitk to use it:

  http://public-inbox.org/git/18221.2285.259487.655684@cargo.ozlabs.ibm.com/

but AFAICT it was never merged.

It looks like QGit had a patch around that time, too, but left
the line using "--early-output" commented out until Git merged the
patches. And then it never got uncommented. ;)

Tig doesn't seem to use it at all. I don't know about other GUIs. I'd
kind of doubt, given the obscurity of the feature (both gitk and qgit
authors were involved in the discussion way back in 2007).

The nice thing about deprecating it is that I think callers need to be
prepared to handle the case already that it does nothing. So if we just
ripped out the code and treated it as a silent noop, everything would
just work.
