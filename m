You know I would never complain about a long commit message. :)

Both patches look OK to me. My only comment on the first one was "you
should just use 'return'", but I see Eric beat me to it.

I do think the postimage of the second one is a little less readable.
That's not a big deal to me, but I'm pretty sure I would intentionally
write it the "original" way if I found myself in a similar situation.
Which makes me wonder whether we'll end up accidentally re-introducing
these kinds of "-x" failures. But as I said before, I'm willing to wait
and see.
