Oh, right, that makes sense. So it's effectively not finding _any_
suffix between X-RC1 and X-beta-1, because we only start looking after
"X-", and none of them match.

I am still confused why "2.6.0-beta-1" doesn't get sorted with its
peers. I'd guess that the comparison function doesn't actually provide a
strict ordering, so the results depend on the actual sort algorithm, and
which pairs it ends up comparing.
