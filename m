Dear Git list,

after having talked for so long about a company selling and supporting 
Git, I finally broke down, sat down with the lawyers, and set up the 
company Git Ltd, based in UK.

The purpose is to market, sell and support Git for as many customers as we 
can get.  As a first step, we will sell Git in shrink-wrap boxes starting 
tomorrow.

Of course, this means that all of Git's source code will be closed, 
because we have to sustain our business model _somehow_.  Sorry to all of 
you guys who do not agree with that.

Just to make sure that the Open Source community is okay with this, I 
contacted Richard Stallman, and this is what he told me:

	If you really have a company marketing Git, that is cool, and I 
	fully understand that the only option to keep this a viable 
	business is to go closed source.  It would also be best to move 
	the headquarters to Pyongyang.

Graced by those words, Sir Howard Stringer has kindly agreed to take the 
position of the chair of the board, and Courtenay Valenti will be our CEO.

As a consequence, there will be slight changes to Git: for one, the 
database format will change so that we can protect our valuable 
Intellectual Property, and all the exporters will stop to work.

This is a great day for source code management, and I hope you all will 
enjoy it.

Johannes "Dscho" Schindelin
Chief Fool Officer
