The sha1 routines are in libcrypto. See 3be4b61aa4 (Link with -lcrypto
instead of -lssl when using openssl libraries., 2005-05-10). I also
needed -lz. See 9426167765 (Add "-lz" to link line to get in zlib.,
2005-04-08).

You can patch the Makefile, or just override it like:

  make LIBS='-lcrypto -lz'

which builds for me on current Debian unstable. I don't think you can
actually fetch with that old build, but I used periodically check that
Git v1.0 can fetch happily from GitHub. I haven't in a while, so let me
know if you try it and it doesn't work. ;)
