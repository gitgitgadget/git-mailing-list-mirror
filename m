In reading through the submitted mid-term surveys from students I
found this excellent answer from Stephan Beyer:

Q: What advice would you give to future would-be Summer of Code
mentoring organizations?

Junio, I know you have been working extra hard lately with the
merge of builtin merge, and now gitweb and the sequencer are also
being looked at in much greater detail.

What can we do to smooth out this workload better?  Its awesome
that we were so fortunate to get these great students this year,
and have so much contributed in so little time, but we also do
not want to see maintainer burn-out.  We also want to avoid a
huge backlog of patches.

I don't think we really ever talked about how to help Junio work
through these large contributions that are coming his way.
