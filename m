Haha, no probs

Neither does the job

I either need to figure out how the indexes get involved in the dot
version,
Or give in and create a branch - that's how you guys work mainly, so
that use case will no doubt work 
Or find something else to do the job - mercurial looks promising

sir, i believe you're not reading what is typed.

yes it does.  your example uses "git checkout versionB .", which is NOT
"git checkout <something>"
we are suggesting you do "git checkout versionB" which is different
(HINT: there is NO dot), and which i'm 99% positive will work.

if you still disagree, then i'm sure mercurial will be sufficient for
your needs, and all your dcvs book-lernin' over christmas will be
transferrable.

good luck with whatever option you choose.
