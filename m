No need to expand on the welcoming atmosphere here.  My heinous plot to
subvert the quality of Git has already been thwarted by making sure tha=
t
its "meritocracy" continues relying only on input from those with an
independent income.  I'm just sticking around until my current
contributions move into master so that I=A0can summarize the resulting
low-hanging fruit that the meritorious can then pick at great fanfare.

The sooner my work moves from pu into master, the sooner y'all be rid o=

me.
