We still have most of the same things open as for the 2014 list. I'll
ask around to see if we have. Last year I wasn't involved in the
candidate selection but IIRC we didn't do a project as none of the
applications showed the candidates would be capable of doing the
project they were applying for.

I'll ask around to make sure people would be able to be mentors, but I
think that we would still like to put forward a few projects (I can
send a PR with the projects that we would still like to see to the 2016
page).

Cheers,
