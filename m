Right - row 3 may not be a bug from the point of view of your internals, 
but it means you violate the API of qsort.Therefore a fix is required.

I think your tables are correct.

But I disagree that you could ever call invoking the "****" lines safe. 
Unless you have documentation on what limit GCC (and your other 
compilers) are prepared to put on the undefined behaviour of violating 
that "non-null" constraint.

Up to now dereferencing a null pointer has been implicitly (or 
explicitly?) defined as simply generating SIGSEGV. And that has 
naturally extended into NULL passed to library implementations. But 
that's no longer true - it seems bets are somewhat off.

But, as long as you are confident you never invoke that line without a 
program bug - ie an API precondition of your own QSORT is that NULL is 
legal iff nmemb is zero, then I guess it's fine. Behaviour is defined, 
as long as you don't violate your internal preconditions.
