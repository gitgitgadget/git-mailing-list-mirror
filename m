I suspect that that might be a problem with the fact codeplex seems
to not really provide Subversion repos but rather runs some sort of a
shim to interface Subversion clients with their TFS instance which is
what really hosts non-Mercurial repos.

What makes me think that way is that even svnrdump (a tool for remote
dumping of Subversion repos appeared in v1.7) fails to dump that repo
(my idea was to dump the vld repo then load it into a local repo and
then try cloning the resulting repo using git-svn).  I tried svnrdump on
another two randomly picked Codeplex Subversion repos, and it failed on
all of them in the same way it failed for vld.
Hence maybe you should bring this issue with the Codeplex support team.

P.S.
Please next time you cross-post (posting the same message to more
than one mailing list), include a reference to the original discussion
even if it currently consists just of your message solely.
