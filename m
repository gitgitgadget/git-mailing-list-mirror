Yeah. b2() is wrong for passing "2" to a bool. I assumed that the
compiler would warn of that (at least for people on modern C99
compilers, not the fallback code), but it doesn't seem to. It's been a
long time since I've worked on a code base that made us of "bool", but I
guess that idea is that silently coercing a non-zero int to a bool is
reasonable in many cases (e.g., "bool found_foo = count_foos()").

I guess one could argue that b() is also sub-optimal, as it should just
say "return cond" or "return !cond" rather than explicitly comparing to
true/false. But I won't be surprised if it happens from time to time.

That seems more complex than we want if our goal is just supporting
legacy systems that may or may not even exist. Given your example, I'd
be more inclined to just do a weather-balloon adding <stdbool.h> to
git-compat-util.h, and using "bool" in a single spot in the code. If
nobody screams after a few releases, we can consider it OK. If they do,
it's a trivial patch to convert back.
