Good point. I'm OK with the amount of code here for the nicer message
(but would be happy either way).

If we were going to track cross-process loops like Ã†var suggested, I
think I'd rather go with a simple counter and just ask the user to run
with GIT_TRACE when it exceeds some maximum sanity value. For two
reasons:

  1. Passing a counter through the environment is way simpler than
     an arbitrarily-sized list.

  2. When you get into multiple processes, there's potentially more
     going on than just Git commands. You might have a git command which
     runs a hook which runs a third party script which runs a git
     command, which runs a hook, and so on. That full dump is going to
     be more useful.
