On SourceForge you can vote to nominate projects for the Community Choice
Awards 2009. The top 10 projects in each category will be nominated for the
award. All projects that will be nominated should get a lot publicity. I
think all votes should go to Git Extensions because this tool has become
really usefull for me and the company I work. When you also use Git
Extensions or just think it is any good, I appriciate you vote!

I nominated Git Extensions for the Best Tool or Utility for Developers
category.
