Thanks for picking up this loose end. I like the general approach here,
but...

Is SOURCE_NONE a complete match for what we want?

I see problems in both directions:

 - sorting by "objectname" works now, but it's marked with SOURCE_OBJ,
   and would be forbidden with your patch.  I'm actually not sure if
   SOURCE_OBJ is accurate; we shouldn't need to access the object to
   show it (and we are probably wasting effort loading the full contents
   for tools like for-each-ref).

   However, that's not the full story. For objectname:short, it _does_ call
   find_unique_abbrev(). So we expect to have an object directory.

 - sorting by "HEAD" hits a BUG(), and would still be allowed with your
   patch.

So I like the idea here that the particular atoms would tell us whether
they're going to need to be in a repository or not, but I think the
annotations have to be cleaned up first.

Regardless of our solution, we probably want to add an extra test making
sure that something vanilla like:

  nongit git ls-remote --sort=v:refname "$TRASH_DIRECTORY"

continues to work (we do test ls-remote outside a repo already, but not
with a sort specifier).
