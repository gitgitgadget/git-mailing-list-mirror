FWIW, that was my first thought, too.

I think it also makes it hard to do one thing which (I think) people
would want: if there is a single deep ref, complete the whole thing.
E.g., given:

  $ git for-each-ref --refname='%(refname)'
  refs/heads/foo/bar
  refs/heads/foo/baz
  refs/heads/another/deep/one

we'd ideally complete "fo" to "foo/" and "ano" to "another/deep/one",
rather than making the user tab through each level.

Doing that requires actually understanding that the refs are in a list,
and not formatting each one independently. So I kind of wonder if it
would be easier to simply have a completion mode in ref-filter.
