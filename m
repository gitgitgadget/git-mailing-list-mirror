According to "http://marc.info/?t=121985955200002&r=1&w=2", you mentioned "Planet Git" and only one response other than yours on the topic was somebody offering server hosting space, so no, sorry, I do not see any evidence that your post produced any positive or negative feedback.

But I think this, if done right, is a great idea and everybody will welcome "Planet Git" as the "official weblog aggregator".  I think a true "Git News" that is written by somebody to summarize the happenings in the Git land in a coherent voice would be much more preferable, but that takes real work (which you may or may not be interested in), and aggregated blog would be the best thing we can have without too much effort.
