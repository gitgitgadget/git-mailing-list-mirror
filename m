I see two uses for memory pools:

  1. You want to optimize allocations (either locality or per-allocation
     overhead).

  2. You want to make a bunch of allocations with the same lifetime
     without worrying about their lifetime otherwise. And then you can
     free them all in one swoop at the end.

And my impression is that you were interested in (2) here. If what
you're saying is that another way to do that is:

  str = xstrfmt(...whatever...);
  attach_to_pool(pool, str);

  ...much later...
  free_pool(pool);

then yeah, I'd agree. And that is a lot less tricky / invasive than what
I suggested.

So here it sounds like you do care about some of the performance
aspects. So no, it would not allow that. You'd be using the vast pool of
heap memory provided by malloc(), and trusting that a call to malloc()
is not that expensive in practice. I don't know how true that is, or how
much it matters for this case.
