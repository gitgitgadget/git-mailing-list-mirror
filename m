You are correct, this doesn't help with either of those examples, as
they both require blobs outside of the current sparse-checkout. The
idea is for users who are most often in a given sparse-checkout to have
the experience as if they were in a non-partial Git clone, as long as
they restrict their activity within their sparse-checkout.

If they increase their sparse-checkout, then they can re-run 'git
backfill --sparse' to get the still-missing objects in the new paths.

`git survey` also works on a whole repo, but with the path-walk API
implementation can talk about a group of objects that appear at a common
path instead of only talking about single extreme objects, such as one
large binary (that never changes) being singled out over a small file
that chnages frequently and across all versions contributes more to the
repo's disk size.

The main benefit of using `git survey` over `git-sizer` is that it can
report on things internal to Git's storage that are not accessible to
`git-sizer` through the `git cat-file` output it uses.

 From what I can see, `git pack-objects --path-walk` outperforms all other
repacking strategies that I have found, but it does have some weaknesses in
how it interacts with things like delta islands. There may be other concerns,
and I _was_ able to find a repo that compressed slightly better with `git
pack-objects --full-name-hash`, but it was also storing computer-generated,
single-line JSON files representing configuration of production systems. I
would like to have a more generic thing to say about this, but it will vary
on data shape.

Combining the two features actually ends up with very similar performance
to what `--full-name-hash` already does. It's actually important that the
`--path-walk` option does a full pass of the objects via the standard
name-hash after its first pass in groups based on the path.

It's more that I include performance tests that compare how effective the
two features are relative to the existing repacking strategy and in a few
different situations. This helps with both time and space performance
measurements.

The previously-existing data could only group objects by type (commit,
tree, blob) and report on the size of the reachable objects in those
categories. The per-path data was not available as no tool that I knew
about had the capability to expose that information.

The numbers were so small they didn't seem like they could have accounted
for any issues at all, let alone a hundred gigabytes of data in the repo.

I was not clear about this, but the RFC is 30 patches so it's possible to see
the big picture, but I will be breaking it into at least four series in
sequence for actual review. They match the four sections described above, but
will be in the opposite order:

  A. `git repack --full-name-hash`
  B. `git pack-objects --path-walk`
  C. `git survey`
  D. `git backfill`

(It's possible that `git survey` and `git backfill` may be orthogonal enough
that they could be under review at the same time. Alternatively, `git backfill`
may jump the line because it's so simple to implement once the path-walk API
is established.)

This was definitely Jeff's intention, and I agree. Hopefully we can establish
a baseline quickly and then make room for extensions as people discover new
ways to investigate repo size or performance issues.

My rework of the `git pack-objects --path-walk` series has a draft of a
technical document as you suggest [1]. I regret not having time to get
it done before this RFC.

I suppose this depends on your definition of "nearby" and I think we are
using it differently.

The --full-name-hash mechanism groups objects by their full path name, with
a small probability of a collision with another path, and thus we can think
about it as grouping objects by their full path. However, this lack of
collision comes at a cost: having unequal but "near" hash value does not
imply any similarity in the full path.

The standard name-hash algorithm has a form of "locality" that provides a
nice property: paths with unequal by "near" hash values will have some
similarities in the end of their path names.

Between these two mechanisms, the collisions of the standard name-hash
can cause objects that should delta together to be separated in the object
order due to too many objects with the same hash value, even though they
have very different full path names. While the full-name-hash mechanism
helps keep objects from the same path close together in the order, it
fails to compute good deltas across objects from different paths, even
if they may end similarly (implying similar file types or even renames
across directories).

The --path-walk feature has the nice benefit that it first attempts to
compute delta bases are grouped to exactly the set of objects that
appear at a given path (no more, no less) but then it _also_ does the
standard name-hash sort to help look for delta bases using the name-hash
locality heuristic.

I hesitate to conclude that four bytes per object will not have a meaningful
impact. One thing that I'll be reporting on in my v2 of the --full-name-hash
feature is that I've gone and tried to prototype what would happen with this
kind of approach.

The short version is that I failed to make the addition of more data to this
struct helpful in outperforming the --full-name-hash option. I thought that
a two-pass approach would work, but something about how the two sorts worked
caused problems that I could not overcome. (Maybe someone with a stronger
handle on this could make it work.) My WIP branch is here [2] for anyone
willing to try to succeed where I failed.

We could sort the objects using both hash functions (say, name-hash then
full-name-hash to break ties) but then the full-name-hash values keep
the similar-sized objects with the same name-hash from being sorted near
each other (at least, within the short default window, which I use for
all of my testing). So this ends up being ineffective. In [2] above, this
is something I tested along the way and am pretty confident that it does
not work as well as we'd like it to.

My guess here is that we are finding the "best" deltas quickly, allowing
us to short-circuit the possibility of other deltas due to file size
differences. (If my object has size X, with a current delta of size D,
then any object smaller than X - D will not be a good base.)

True. I could compute that manually, as this data is not available in the
same process. I'll try to do that in the future.

Yes, similar results happen there. I haven't dug into them very much to see
if it helps point out anything about inefficiencies in --full-name-hash, but
I don't expect any of the big differences between --full-name-hash and
--path-walk to appear in these tables.

Yes, I only meant for them to be available for those who were curious to
explore. Please do review v2 of the --full-name-hash series [3].
