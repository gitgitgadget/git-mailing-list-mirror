There have been several complaints about your behavior since you
returned[1,2,3,4], in addition to the times I and others have simply
left threads because they did not feel that arguing with you was
productive (a thing that several people, myself included, told you in
the past that they would do).

I have not paid all that close attention to this remote-hg contrib
argument. Maybe you are 100% right and Junio is wrong and lying and
cannot back up his decision, but somehow needs to cover it up through
rhetoric. But that does not at all match my past experiences with
Junio's behavior.  And given my past experiences with you, and your
behavior in response to the discussion, I find it likely that either
mis-communication or your stubbornness is a likely factor. And also
given those experiences, I've avoided wading into the thread myself or
spending too much time thinking about it.

I can understand that it hurts to be called a troll. I really do believe
you are trying your best to improve git. But I hope you also understand
that in terms of the time and emotional drains on other participants,
from our perspective interacting with you is quite similar to
interacting with a troll.

Your continued arguing on this topic does not seem like it is going
anywhere, and I believe is wasting time and hurting the atmosphere of
the list. Please stop. You have had many chances to interact with people
on the list[5], and now you are seeing the consequences of your
behaviors: people have little tolerance for you and will stop paying
attention.

[5] Even though you were previously asked to leave, I believe people
    on the list gave interacting with you a fair shot in the past month
    or two. And we somehow still ended up at the same place.  That's
    just my perception, of course. I'd invite anybody watching to form
    their own opinions.
