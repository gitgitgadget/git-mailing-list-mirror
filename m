  see

	http://news.gmane.org/find-root.php?message_id=<7vvepqi6x6.fsf@assigned-by-dhcp.cox.net>

and replies for some slides from OLS (dunno if jdl's made his
available?), and http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/GitLinks for links to plenty
of "using git" pages for various projects and other introductory
articles. There are also few crash courses at git.or.cz but they go by
the Cogito path; the general outline just with different commands might
be still somewhat useful, though. Also, someone from #git was presenting
lately and is planning on making his presentation available, too.
