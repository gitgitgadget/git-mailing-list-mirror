Thanks Jonathan. I've converted some of our Subversion repos to Git
recently. They're hosted on GitHub now too. I wasn't aware of all of
these tools. I'm sure they would have helped.

This is one of the more tricky repos, and no one here has the time to
work on it this month, which is by when it needs to be completed.

Thanks.
