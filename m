Well, then perhaps the name of the command should be updated, too, to
better reflect what it actually does...

I don't think this is a valid comparison, because, practically, Git
just didn't work after I deleted all pack index files.  So while they
can be easily (re)generated, they are essential to make pack files
usable.  The commit-graph and .midx files, however, can be safely
deleted, and everything keeps working as before.

OTOH, this is an excellent comparison, and I do think of the .midx and
graph files the same way as the pack index files.  During a clone, the
pack index file isn't generated by running a separate 'git gc
(--auto)', but by clone (or fetch-pack?) running 'git index-pack'.
The way I see it that should be the case for these other files as well.

And it is much simpler, shorter, and cleaner to either run 'git
commit-graph ...' or even to call write_commit_graph_reachable()
directly from cmd_clone(), than to bolt on another option and config
variable on 'git gc' [1] to coax it into some kind of an "after clone"
mode, that it shouldn't be doing in the first place.  At least for
now, so when we'll eventually get as far ...

... that what you wrote here becomes a reality (and I fully agree that
this is what we should ultimately aim for), then we won't have that
option and config variable still lying around and requiring
maintenance because of backwards compatibility.

I noticed a few times that I got surprisingly large packs from GitHub,
e.g. there is over 70% size difference between --single-branch cloning
v2.19.0 from GitHub and from my local clone or from kernel.org (~95MB
vs. ~55MB vs ~52MB).  After running 'git repack -a -d -f' they all end
up at ~65MB, which is a nice size reduction for the clone from GitHub,
but the others just gained 10-13 more MBs.
