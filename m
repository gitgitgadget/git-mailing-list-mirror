Yep, that would work. I wasn't going to bother with that complexity
unless somebody really wanted it. The important thing is not to paint
ourselves into a corner. By the rules you gave above, it would probably
be fine to extend my patch later to match. But we could also be more
specific (e.g., look for some positive value like "1").

Yeah, I had the same thought. I also considered using "DWIM", which is
the name by which I know the feature. But since "--no-guess" is the
matching option, I went with that.

Ah, I didn't know that. Usually I use "||", but I thought "-o" was
generally preferred in bash-specific scripts. We definitely want to
short circuit here.
