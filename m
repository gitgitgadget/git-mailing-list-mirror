I like the idea of "git status" explaining what operations are "in
progress" and what the user might want to do next to complete the
operation.

As for the desire for "undo", it probably makes sense to just keep
focusing on making "git reset" a nice, safe way to undo any sort of
"in progress" operation. The recent cleanup patches are in line with
this.

One thing that conflicts with that goal a bit is that git-reset is
also used to move the current branch arbitrarily in the commit DAG,
and also (with --hard) to discard local commits. Those are definitely
less "safe" operations.
