Could we just leave open a pipe descriptor that the child inherits, and
wait for it to close?

Something like:

  git gc --auto 9>&1 | read

should wait until the background gc process finishes. It depends on our
daemonize() not closing descriptors beyond 0/1/2, but that is certainly
the case now.

It also loses the exit status of the main "git gc", but that can be
fixed with shell hackery:

  code=$(sh -c 'git gc --auto; echo $?' 9>&1)
  test "$code" = 0
