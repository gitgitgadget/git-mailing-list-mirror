This is almost certainly an oversight in the implementation; the
--separate-git-dir option wasn't mentioned during development of
git-worktree as far as I recall.

As this relocation of the repository is entirely under Git's control
(as opposed to the user mucking around as with "mv .git ../foo), it
does indeed seem reasonable that --separate-git-dir should update the
worktree meta-information files. As far as I know, there is no
existing machinery to perform this sort of update, though, so it would
have to be implemented from scratch.

Again, an oversight; --separate-git-dir wasn't on anyone's mind during
development. This is just utterly broken, as far as I can tell; it
doesn't move the repository out of the main worktree to the new
location but instead seems to make a copy of it (minus the
.git/worktrees directory) and drops entries from the original
.git/worktrees directory, thus breaking everything. I suppose it could
error out, though friendlier would be for it to behave correctly.
