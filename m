The usual thing is to just squash it into your patch. You can say
something like "Test cases from Jeff King." in the commit message to
give credit (though I am happy either way). And then ideally you'd have
my sign-off to make it clear the code matches the DCO. So here it is
(and you can just stick this before your sign-off at the end of the
commit message):

Signed-off-by: Jeff King <peff@peff.net>

And then for the rest, you can follow the guide in
Documentation/SubmittingPatches. Presumably you're comfortable using
send-email, given the topic of the patch. :) But since you're got the
patch on GitHub already, you can also use https://gitgitgadget.github.io.

Given the text Carlo found in the documentation, I think this is the
intended behavior. So I think we can make it part of the expected
behavior in the test. I do still think that second test is worth having.
An obvious-but-wrong thing to do here would be to set $in_reply_to to
undef after the first iteration through the loop, rather than the value
given on the command-line. The test makes sure we get that right.
