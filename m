Doh, you're right. I grepped for spots setting encode_email_headers, but
the one in cmd_format_patch() is copying it from the config-default into
the rev_info, not into the pretty-print context.

Which makes sense. It is going to call show_log() to show each commit,
which is where the value is copied into the pretty-print context.

Right, I was just confused.

I don't know that it was unwise. I was mostly just noting the history
because that explains why we _didn't_ simply refer to ctx->revs in
6bf139440c. Has the separation between the two been valuable since then?
I'm not sure. We do have some code paths that do not have a rev_info at
all (e.g., pp_commit_easy(), which makes an ad-hoc empty context
struct).

Yeah, philosophically it may be better to keep the modules separated.
But if we end up having to just copy a ton of fields, it may not be as
practical. If we can at least factor that out into a single spot,
though, it may not be so bad.

I had a similar thought, but the pretty_print_context carries both input
options from the caller, as well as computed state used internally by
the pretty-print code. So you'd have to split those two up, I would
think. And now all of the pretty-print functions have to pass around
_two_ contexts.

That's more annoying, but arguably is a cleaner design (the internal
struct can be a private thing that is not even defined outside of
pretty.c). I dunno.
