Dear diary, on Tue, Apr 11, 2006 at 03:50:14PM CEST, I got a letter
where Linus Torvalds <torvalds@osdl.org> said that...
> I think the builtins should be a install-time only issue. 

I don't care about git-log in particular since I don't use it, but I use
development Git versions without actually installing them and if it's
not a huge hurdle, it would be nice to keep this possible.

Right now I am having amnesia and deja-vu at the same time.  I think
I have forgotten this before.
