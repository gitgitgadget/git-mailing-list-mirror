After seeing "efficient", I was momentarily surprised by the first hunk:

This is actually slightly _less_ efficient, because we already are using
the precomputed len, and the new code will call an extra strbuf_grow()
to cover the case where the two arguments are the same.  See 81d2cae
(strbuf_addbuf(): allow passing the same buf to dst and src,
2010-01-12).

But it almost certainly doesn't matter, and it definitely _is_ an
improvement for the other "addstr" cases, which are doing an unncessary
strlen().

And anyway the readability improvement trumps all of that in my mind. So
I think overall it is a nice cleanup; I'm mostly just commenting for the
sake of other reviewers.
