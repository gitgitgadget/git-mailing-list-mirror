That sounds like the best way to me. How do you envision screwing it up?

If you anticipate messing up while removing the changes, that's only 
likely if there are conflicts and any other strategy is likely to be 
worse there.

If you suspect you'll forget to remove them before sending for code 
review there may be ways to help with that. Easiest you can add a large 
notice in the commit message(s) and/or comments; this may not prevent 
going for review but reviewers should catch it pretty quickly. To help 
prevent it even getting that far you may be able to add a pre-push hook 
to prevent such commits from being pushed to somewhere other than a 
private fork or a branch with a name that clearly indicates that it 
contains experimental code.
