I was thinking this was matters only for "bundle verify", which is not
all that interesting (either you can clone from it, or you cannot).

It is also used as part of unbundle(), which is called from the
transport code. But at that point of a clone, we'd already have created
the new repository we're writing into. I.e., "git clone .../foo.bundle"
still works fine either way.

So I guess you are asking only about the part that I dismissed above as
"not all that interesting". I.e., do people actually run:

  git bundle verify foo.bundle &&
  git clone foo.bundle

That is not nonsense, per-se, but it is somewhat pointless since the
clone will verify the bundle itself anyway. But then, I guess I do not
see much point in anyone calling "bundle verify" in the first place.
