This is a separate topic; IMO we need another admin.

That's not evidence in my book.

Note that Johannes is playing with words: "As for the accusation that
there was no explanation: this is false."; there's a difference
between explaining why somebody has been banned, and warning somebody
_before_ banning him. I suggested the latter didn't happen, Johannes
reluctantly reassured the former.

I'm not interested in begging Johannes for a detailed explanation of
what happened, that's what the user talk pages are for.

I don't think having more than one admin is overshooting.

Who is going to do that? Johannes apparently already said his last
words on that topic.

That is a separate topic.

I disagree.

If the wiki followed the git workflow, then the changes would have to
be proposed as patches to the mailing list, and a maintainer would
review and apply them to the wiki. Obviously that's not how wikis
work; anyone can contribute to the wiki, and such contributions don't
have to touch the mailing list. The wiki and the mailing list are
independent.

Similarly, there's no need to cause noise in the mailing list about
disputes in the wiki. For example: "Why did you revert my change in
page FooBar?"; the mailing list doesn't know about page FooBar, nor
the changes that are happening there, so any dispute will catch the
mailing list out of context.

Moreover there are people interested on the wiki, but not on the mailing list.
