I would be tempted to call it "--no-template", but I think that is too
confusing. The "--template" option is not really about the git-generated
template, but about a user-defined template that goes on top of the
git-generated one (I would have expected --template=/dev/null to do what
you want, too, but it retains the git template).

Probably "--no-status" would be a good name, as the generated template
is the format generated by "git status".
