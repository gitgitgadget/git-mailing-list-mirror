Title:
GUI GIT mobile client
Name:

idea

Now mobile phones have a large enough capacity and flexibility. If you
have access to the Internet, you can correct the necessary documents
in any convenient location. But the good applications for mobile
phones is not available. On this, my main idea is to create a GUI GIT
client for the popular OS (android, IOS, Symbian, and others) with
syntax highlighting for popular programming languages (C + +, java,
php, python, perl, html, css, JavaScript, etc.).

implementation

To begin, I'll implement a simpler version. The task at least, is:

Creating a full-fledged GUI GIT client for android;
The implementation of a text editor with syntax highlighting html, css
and javascript;
Implementation in two languages: Russian and English (for translation
into English, I use the services of a professional translator).


My ultimate goal is to implement a GUI client for mobile phones GIT
with syntax of programming languages.
I want to make a specialized application for mobile phones, in which
the user will be able to if you are connected to the Internet through
a few clicks to connect to the repository, make changes to files,
Commit latest changes and see what changes have been made earlier. The
application is divided into two main sub yes: the client GIT, through
which all operations will be carried out with the repository and handy
text editor with syntax highlighting. Switching between them will
occur very quickly.
I think that the GIT community gets the most benefit from this project:
This will allow the use of GIT in any convenient place for the user,
for example, even in the subway on the way home;
This will make the GIT even more popular, because mobility will
attract more users, and user-friendly interface makes use of an
intuitive and enjoyable;
This allows to follow the actual trend of mobile technology today, and
will win the love and loyalty of users.
I really want to do this project completely because I'm interested,
and even the technology is very necessary to me. I spend a lot of time
on the road, and with such a program and be able to spend it usefully.
I will have more free time to implement new ideas.


Tentative timeline:
April - May 14th
Read more about GIT and android, studying examples of source code,
source, wiki, writing pieces of code that are useful in the future.
Develop a detailed work plan.
May 15th - June 7th
Working on my first part of the application GUI GIT mobile client,
which must connect to the repository and exchange data. At the initial
stage of the GUI will not be used. Writing server-side applications.
June 8th - June 30th
Full implementation of the server side. The application performs most
of the necessary commands GIT.
July 1st - July 14th
The development of convenient and fast text editor with syntax
highlighting. By this time all the server-side applications must be
fully prepared. GIT client performs all necessary functions.
July 15th - July end
Development of a convenient GUI. The implementation of this Annex.
Pilot testing an application under heavy loads to the north. Alpha
testing of the application.
August
Code cleanup and correction of possible errors. Changes to the GUI for
ease of reference, if need be. Get ready to merge. The final beta
testing.


I am the best person to work on this project because ... I have a
great interest to do so, as it would be beneficial for me in the first
place. And I really, really want to do it. I want to finish this
project in any way.
I have a good experience with open source - with your friends, I am
writing your own application, which unfortunately is not yet ready. I
am using GIT every day for over two years. I have implemented several
programs that are very popular at my university and GIT helped me a
lot in this. GIT several times saved me from losing important data,
and now I want to help this project. I want to do something useful for
the community and the GIT and to write this application. For me it is
very important part in this project!


About me
I am currently a student of the Kursk State University, Department of
Computer Science (software and management information systems), the
second year of study. Besides the fact that I know C and C + +, I have
extensive experience with the code and reading other people's code. I
won twice as urban programming contests and won prizes in the
All-Russian competitions in programming. Participation in this project
will be a new step in my development and significantly improve my
reputation at the university. For me it is very important to bring
this project to the end and realize this vision. Also, I'm interested
in this project, because I use every day GIT at home and at work, and
I want to do a little better GIT.
