I'm on the fence. It is probably not a big deal, and my biggest issue is
just that I had to walk through the explanation in my previous mail to
convince myself the change was not missing an important case.

But having done so, the main value in re-rolling would be preventing
somebody else from reading the code and having the same question. But
this discussion in the archive is probably sufficient.
