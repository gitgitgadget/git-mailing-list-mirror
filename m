I suspect that many people will see this anyway, but for those who don't 
read lwn there is an article osted today about git (initially pointing at 
the git magic site) that is attracting quite a few comments (18 so far)

Git Magic may not be exactly new, but some of us have stumbled across it 
later than others. It is a highly readable introduction to git with lots 
of examples of how to get things done. "As Arthur C. Clarke observed, any 
sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. This is 
a great way to approach Git: newbies can ignore its inner workings and 
view Git as a gizmo that can amaze friends and infuriate enemies with its 
wondrous abilities. Rather than go into details, we provide rough 
instructions for particular effects. After repeated use, gradually you 
will understand how each trick works, and how to tailor the recipes for 
your needs."
