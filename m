One thing I noticed is that there is no link to the msysgit project for
the windows development under community. The only way you can find it is
under download when you look closely at the text when the download is
starting.

Could we add some information about msysgit for windows development on
the community page?

Maybe the same applies for other OS like the osx installer?

Cheers Heiko
