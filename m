This is somewhat off topic here, so I apologize, but  I  didn't  know
any better place to ask:

Has anybody any information if SourceForge is going to provide git  /
cogito / ... for the projects they host? I asked SF, and they openend
a new Feature Request (item #1252867); the message I received sounded
as if I was the first person on the planet to ask...

Am I really alone with this?

Best regards,

Wolfgang Denk
