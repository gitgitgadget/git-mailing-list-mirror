Hi,

Please do not top-post; it is annoying.  If that is not good enough a 
reason for you to avoid it: it is also against the customs in this list.

Second, it is a pity that you did not work with me to resolve the issue.  
I would have liked to squash this bug very much, but your unwillingness to 
work with me on the bug does not make me enthusiastic about trying to help 
you in the future.  As it is, my time writing the mails to you seems to 
have been wasted.

Ciao,
Dscho
