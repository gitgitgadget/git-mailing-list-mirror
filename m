I don't think this is right.

Debian has debian-user, debian-devel, and a host of other lists.  Some
are mixed (debian-kde), some aren't (debian-devel).  

debian-user is extremely high volume.  In fact, its volume normally
dwarfs that of debian-devel.  As a developer, it would be virtually
impossible to participate in development discussions without having to
spend an inordinate amount of time each day filtering out all the
discussions about KDE icons or whatnot.  

Not that these are *bad* discussions, or that developers never
subscribe to -user, but there are some developers (such as myself)
with limited time to devote to the project, and I feel my time is
better spent on development than on filtering through 1000 messages
each day that I'm not really interested in.

Moreover, as a *user* of some projects, I appreciate the distinction
as well.  I do not want to be a pest to the developers that are
donating their time to improve the project I benefit from when my
question could be perfectly well addressed by other users more
experienced than I.

As an example, I subscribe to the MythTV user list but not the
development list.  There are all sorts of discussions there --
everything from what TVs are best in different situations to
discussions over cable company encryption and setup of the MythTV web
interface.  I don't read most of them, but find some interesting.  At
the same time, I am not really interested in the latest SVN commits
for MythTV.  I upgrade my box maybe once a year and don't really care
about development internals, so as a user, this separation benefits me
too.

I don't see a -user list as a bad thing for a community the size of
Git.

Think about it this way: once the Windows stuff for Git gets mature
(to the TortoiseGit level), there are going to be a lot of people
using Git that really *can't* operate a mail client because the only
"mail client" at their disposal is Outlook.
