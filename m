Yeah, that seems quite sensible to me[1].

If you (or anybody else) are interested in working on this, I suspect
the answer is to just sprinkle some calls to verify_path() in the right
spots. Probably in fast-import.c:file_change_m(), etc.

[1] Stretching to think of a way this might backfire, I guess somebody
    could be using Git as an intermediate format to then convert to
    another system. But that seems terribly obscure, and at most I think
    we should give that case an escape hatch to disable the check; it
    should definitely be on by default.
