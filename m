To be honest I've been playing a bit with some git features that I've
never explored, and was trying to create a fairly simple 'email CLI'
upon git send-email and other git commands (just because git can) just
for the fun.

Just like you said, there's seems not be a 'clear benefit from such
change--it sounds more like a set of
"because we could" not "because we need to" changes'. I was more
curious to understand this git behavior than asking to fix the
bug/implement the feature, so please feel free not to implement this.

Thanks,
Pedro Rijo
