Just to clarify: last year we were co-mentoring with Ram. I ended up
having a lot of time and did most of the work (not blaming Ram, and I
enjoyed the experience). I'm still motivated to co-mentor, but this time
the co-mentoring has to be more balanced (or unballanced to the other
mentor ;-) ).

Yes, as a mentor I did appreciate having Junio as impartial
maintainer/reviewer. And he did for sure contribute even without being a
mentor!

>From your list, it seems we can target 1 or 2 slots. I'd say it's still
worth applying, but if we don't find more mentors then perhaps it would
make sense to say so explicitely in
http://git.github.io/SoC-2015-Ideas.html so that students looking for
organization know that we'll have very few slots.
