I did find that the introduction paragraphs in this and its companion
patch needed a little more background of the uninitiated.

I felt it needed a few words to highlight the innovative, potentially
'breaking', changes that CHERI (&co) provides, such as the hidden bit,
the shift from classic von Neumann architecture, inclusion of typing
forÂ  values, etc. and how that affects the compromises that are within
the C standard (and those that features misreadings and conflicts with it).

Some of the follow up discussions have a great similarity with the
Windows LLP64 (`long long`) issues that also confuse the arithmetic
operation capabilities with the memory pointer capabilities.

The layout needed a bit of SPIN (situation, problem, implication, need
payoff) to see how it hangs together across all the different
implementations. I know, from experience, it's not easy to pick out the
'obvious', but implicit, foundational aspects. While, explaining them
from an implementation perspective is easy for those who know the
implementation, I found it took a few reads to get my head around the
discussion (e.g. I wasn't familiar with `typedef union`s).

Improved memory safety does sound to be worthwhile!
