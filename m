Eh? So it doesn't even run the signal handlers? Or if it is SIG_DFL
(i.e., we have already run all the handlers), then it just calls _exit?

OK. That makes sense; we don't bother checking the return code because
it's mostly just registering a cleanup function. The only sane thing to
do on an error (besides ignore it) is to abort whatever we're doing, and
I'm not sure it's worth it.

I do feel a little like this is a trap waiting to spring for future
coders to break Windows, but I think your change doesn't make anything
_worse_ in that regard.
