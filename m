I certainly assumed it was, because it is in most cases it is. And something
like "HEAD:RelNotes/1.5.1.5.txt" certainly _looks_ like one, and is
generated by the current git. And what is the point of coming up with a
file listing if the names you return do not actually exist?

Yes, though we seem to normalize paths already. So the other entries
from that command are (in git.git):

  HEAD:../.mailmap
  HEAD:RelNotes/1.5.1.5.txt

So we could either:

  1. Prepend the current path before normalizing to yield:

      HEAD:.mailmap
      HEAD:Documentation/RelNotes/1.5.1.5.txt

  2. Teach the get_sha1 path parser about "..", and prepend "./" when we
     are in a prefixed subdir.

      HEAD:./../.mailmap
      HEAD:./RelNotes/1.5.1.5.txt
