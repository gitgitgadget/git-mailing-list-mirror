Last year's GitTorrent implementation never got off the ground.
The student who we accepted was unable to actually participate due
to legal problems, and we did not find out about it until too late
in the program to select a replacement student.

So in short, there's nothing wrong with last year's GitTorrent,
as there was no last year's GitTorrent.  Hence it is on the list
again for this year.  :)
