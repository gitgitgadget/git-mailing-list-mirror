Perhaps this is just a personal style thing, but I prefer the
goto because it makes it clear that we know the answer and are
done searching.  I know it's a small thing and I know we do it
all the time, but setting state here in just the right way as
to defeat the loop would work, but is a little less clear.  But
again, that is a personal style thing I guess.

Yes, it looks like we could decrement "last" here.  And yes, I
suspect it would have minimal impact.  I'll pass on that in this
series to keep it focused on the advertised goal of simply
appending if possible.

I'd like to limit the scope of this patch series to just
the advertised topic and save the arithmetic fixes to
another patch series like 19716b21a4.
