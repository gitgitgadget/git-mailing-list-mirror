Perhaps we should just make the home page a wiki! It would work really
good! If we use a theme like they do at wiki.ubuntu.com or somewhere
else we could make it look really nice for a home page. Then once it's
set up, no one has to manage the page, worry about commits, who's
doing what, etc, and just have the pages edited and worked on by the
community at large who register at the site to edit. (Unlike the wiki
in use now something would have to be done to stop the spam, like
having those boxes at registration where you have pick the letters
out) Once set up it would simplify things. Do I dare say that Hg uses
the wiki idea. Works but their theme really looks horrible. Of course
git would do it better. ;) Ours would be way more pretty! Anyone else
think a wiki would work for home page? If we could get some work done
on the theme on moinmoin and get it upgraded and completely set up we
could do a mockup of what it could look like and if people like it
just get rid of the old and have the wiki page be the start page. It
would also solve the news problem as I'm willing and I'm sure others
would too edit to make sure it's up to date.

Others that make moinmoin look good:

http://live.gnome.org/
