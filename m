Hrm. At first I thought this was redundant with the stdin thing in the
previous one. But that is only checking "did you _try_ to use stdin".
This is checking "did you accidentally use stdin, which was empty".

But I think maybe it's the opposite; the other one is redundant with
this one, since it would be hard to convince grep to read from stdin
anyway with this.

Yeah, I agree this would help most cases, but not hurt in others. I do
think Junio's "see if the final argument is a file" approach seems like
it would cover us pretty accurately, though, without having to get too
intimate with grep options.
