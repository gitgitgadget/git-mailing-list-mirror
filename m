I really _love_ how the default response on this list for any problem is
to treat one as an idiot and openly show one's contempt.  The
information about subscribing to the mailing list can be found at the
Git home page at <URL:http://git.or.cz/#community>.  It does not mention
anything like a mailing list home page.  Only the archives are
mentioned, and those contain no pointer whatsoever.  It does remind me
of the late Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy:

    `...You hadn't exactly gone out of your way to call attention to
    them had you? I mean like actually telling anyone or anything.'
    `But the plans were on display...'
    `On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find
     them.'
    `That's the display department.'
    `With a torch.'
    `Ah, well the lights had probably gone.'
    `So had the stairs.'
    `But look you found the notice didn't you?'
    `Yes,' said Arthur, `yes I did. It was on display in the bottom of a
     locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the
     door saying "Beware of The Leopard".'

Anyway, with your pointer I might be able to work through the stuff and
figure out what makes vger so unique here as a mailing list host.

On the other hand: why bother participating in a community that turns
openly hostile whenever one experiences problems?  Where is the fun in
that?  That one will at one point of time be in the situation to lambast
others for their shortcomings, and feel that one is entirely in-style
doing so here?

Is it really impossible to proffer any information without a denigrating
sneer?
