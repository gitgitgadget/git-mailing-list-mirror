I do not see such call in contrib/example/git-merge.sh; could it be
a recent bug that it calls it?

Have you seen a typical merge commit message?  They certainly look
different to me and different rules would apply.

Hmm, I didn't know Gerrit gave Change-ID to merges.

In any case, I would think this is completely new.  Without this
change, commit-msg was not called for merges, so Gerrit wouldn't
have added Change-ID to merges with that mechanism.

A new merge-msg hook would make more sense, if we were making any
change.  I do not want to get yelled at by those who wrote their
commit-msg hooks long time ago and have happily been using them that
updated Git started calling them for their merges where their
validation logic for their single-parent commit do not apply at all.
