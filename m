I wonder, though, how much this helps or hinders the use-case which
prompted this patch series in the first place; to wit, creating
hundreds or thousands of worktrees. Doing so serially was too slow, so
the many "git worktree add" invocations were instead run in parallel
(which led to "discovery" of race conditions). Using a global worktree
lock would serialize worktree creation, thus slowing it down once
again.
