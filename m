You're the one who started talking about me expecting people to use *my* 
editor. I had never done that. I had talked about the _reverse_: the 
idiocy of emacs users expecting people to use that bloated piece of 
crap-ware.

See? Can you not see that normal users don't want to have some random 
emacs crap? In fact, even GNU emacs users (apart from the ones that have 
used it for more than a decade) don't do it.

So stop this *insane* insistence of emacs. You should learn to just assume 
that people don't even have it installed!

Anything that works with some random emacs mode is a total non-usable 
piece of crap as far as most users are concerned.

Oh, a single large html page is certainly better than emacs and info, 
absolutely. Ask *any* normal person.

The fact that you cannot see that fact is a sign of your personal (and 
rather odd) preferences.
