Hello I am new to the list and if I am not following some kind of list
ettiquite please let me know. 

I read in the archives that there was once talk of porting Git over to C#
and was wondering if anything ever came of this?  I realize there were some
that didn't see the use for this but as Git is becoming more and more
popular a more native implementation of Git for windows users would be a
good endevour IMHO.

At any rate any info would be greatly appreciated.

Regards,

JD Guzman
