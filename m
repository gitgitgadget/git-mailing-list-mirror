Keith is saying that unlike ciecle-c, (c) is meaningless.  While
he is right about that, it does not matter, as long as he is
talking about "legal meaning in the US".  It is my understanding
that spelled out "Copyright" (or its abbreviation, "Copr.")
weighs as much as the circle-c mark.

And it matters even less these days.  US law traditionally
required copyright notice to be protected, but after 1989 US
Copyright Act, made in line with Berne convention, the notice is
not even necessary.  It used to be that you would want circle-c,
Copyright and "All Rights Reserved", if you really wanted to be
anal.  Buenos Aires signatories are all Berne members these
days, it became just obsolete inertia.
