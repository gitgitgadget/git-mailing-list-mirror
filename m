No, I don't think that.

Perhaps you think that, but if that is the case, it is based on your own =
sociocultural background. Hey, and let's not forget that supposedly 8% =
or so of all males are red-green blind... ;-)

No. You (well, everybody) should just take a deep breath, step back, and =
ask yourself "Does this really matter that much to me and the rest of =
the world? Is it worth keeping up another long drawn discussion? Is =
there perhaps a chance for a compromise?"

Of course it is completely up to each individual to decide this! Power =
to you!

In the meantime, I'll watch from the sidelines, eat my popcorn, enjoy =
the show, and keep on not using a git logo for anything, indefinitely =
:-).

Of course! That's why I marked it as only being an example.

Indeed. And many shades of red, blue, etc., and let's not forget about =
stripes, dots, and other patterns. So many possibilities! Oh, and can I =
get mine with ponies? :-)

I disagree. And I think you again confuse your personal sociocultural =
conditioning with an universal truth.=20

In closing, let's not forget that for some things, there just is no =
"correct" solution, and I think the choice of a logo is one of these =
cases.


Cheers,
Max
