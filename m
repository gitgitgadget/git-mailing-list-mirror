It would be nice if this reasoning (behind the change from linked list
to growable array) was mentioned in appropriate commit message, and
perhaps also in the cover letter for the series.  It is IMVHO quite
important information (that you thought obvious).

Actually deletion from and insertion into single linked list are
not that hard, and O(1) after finding place, O(N) with finding
included.  Moving elements in array is O(N),... and arguably a bit
simpler - but at high level, with appropriate primitives, they are
about the same.

Yes, array is easier for permutation and reordering.

I would expect sth_append command to take a list (or other collection),
an element, and return [modified] collection with the new element added.
Such API would require temporary variable in caller and memcopy in the
sth_append() function.

This is not it.  It creates a new element, expanding a list (a collection),
and then expose this element.  Which spares us memcopy... on non-critical
path.

I don't know how to name operation "grow list and return new element".
But "append" it is not.

All right.

I have not checked / not remember what caller of parse_insn_line() used
it's return value for.  I guess that we save it into todo_item, moving
that operation from caller to callee.

All right.  Good explanation.  And the one that is too low-level
detail to put in the commit message, I think.

Put it in TODO list (and perhaps add a TODO comment) ;-).

BTW. open-source produces better software, and development bandwidth
is good, but the latency :-((((

I was talking about "Cannot revert during another revert." and
"Cannot cherry-pick during another cherry-pick." errors, which can
never happen because of the outermost if.

   x == A && y == A && x != Y

can never happen, because equality is transitive^*

   x == A && y == A  =>  x == y

*) except NaN (NaN != NaN), but we don't deal with floating point here.


From those error messages it looks like they were originally intended
to prevent from starting another revert or cherry-pick if sequencer
based operation is already in progress (to not stomp on the latter
internal state).  But for that it would need to examine the
opts->subcommand if it is REPLAY_NONE (or equivalent), check that
sequencer file already exists, and read it to fond which operation
is in progress.

This is about checking that command in todo-list agrees with
the git command used (we probably checked that it is --continue,
or maybe --skip).  But the error message does not spell that;
it is misleading.

[Nb. git-blame shows Vasco Almeida as author of those lines]

But that was / is another reason for removing code: it is slightly

No it was not, see the reasoning above.

It did different check, that we continue with the same command
as we began with.

One argument is that you can add options to --continue, and among
options for cherry-pick, revert and rebase -i, there are options
that apply only to some of them.  So we need at least decide what
to do if we started rebase, and try to continue with cherry-pick:
do we accept rebase-only options?  What we do with cherry-pick-only
options, that rebase does not understand?

It is easier to just check that revert is continued with revert
(by checking command in todo file), cherry-pick with cherry-pick
(same), rebase -i with rebase (by checking another file), and
am with am.

It creates new item in the todo_list at the end, or it grows todo_list,
but the function does not append anything...

So the commit parsing was moved from save_todo(), which contrary to
the name also re-generated todo list, to walk_revs_populate_todo().
I guess it is the same callchain.

Additional question, answer to which should address Junio's complaint
about early/eager commit parsing (if I understand it correctly):
do information from parsing commit is needed for creating a new
commit, i.e. doing a pick or revert?  If not, then perhaps parsing
only those commits that are left, at the time of saving todo file
(with probably less commit that what we have started with), would
be better?

All right.  Though I wonder if it should not be mentioned in
the commit message of said previous patch (though I have missed
that not all sites were "future-proofed" in review; I'm sorry).

All right, I can understand that.  But I think it won't cost
much to do _while at it_ adding of quotes around pathnames in
error messages, where you notice this problem.

All right.  And casting one enum to other, relying on the same
