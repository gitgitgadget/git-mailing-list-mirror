Hi Team,

I am trying to setup a local git repository and manage it from local Je=
nkins set-up. So, both Jenkins and git are on my local desktop.

However, I am trying to give the Repository URL but with no luck.

My repository is in D drive in location D:\Git-Try

I tried to configure this Repository URL as ---=A0file:///d/Git-Try =A0=
also file:///D:\Git-Try , but was not successful.

Can you please let me know what should be the Repository URL.

I have created the db in above location, pushed few files and commited =
them as well.

Thanks and Regards,
V. JayaPrakash
