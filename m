True, but this might be a coin toss.  Maybe we should
see what the generated assembly looks like for each ??

I tried to hit the common cases.  This loop runs a lot
and I didn't want to put an O(n^2) thing in there to
look for any matching peer.  Most of the time we are
in a simple 2 or 3 way effort.  I didn't want to pay
for the looping/branching overhead for the obscure [4..8]
efforts.
