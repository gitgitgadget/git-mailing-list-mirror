Kind of. It was impossible to trigger in the original (and we still
don't actually handle it in the revised version; we just die in
xsnprintf).

But still, I'll go with the simpler thing we've discussed here. The
symmetry with ustar_mtime isn't worth it, and doubly so if we just write
a single pax header.
