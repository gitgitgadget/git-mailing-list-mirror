Not necessarily. I've got a journalist background myself. When I went t=
o=20
school we were taught to say what was true, how we came to know that,=20
what we *think* is true, why we think that and what our opinions are=20
about it, preferrably but not necessarily in that order. Speculations=20
and opinions are what differs a journalist from a reporter.

We were also taught that we, as reporters, should be the ones pushing=20
the boundaries and our editors should be holding us back. I think Mr.=20
Lyons editor is not doing a very good job. Some of the articles I=20
stumbled across were not worth the time it took to let google find them=
=20
for me.

I've never met Mr. Lyons or, until today, read anything he's written.=20
 From what little I've gathered though, he seems to be stubborn,=20
narrowminded and rude, but not eloquent enough to pull it off with styl=
e.

That said, journalists are actually supposed to be biased (how can you=20
have opinions for something you don't think anything about?), but in a=20
stylishly blas=E9 and preferrably entertaining sort of way.
