The latest date I could get is 20 Aug 08.  There has to be a way to get 
just todays.  With the high traffice of this list. I really need to get 
them before to many emails come so I can keep my archive consistent.

I really hate reading email via the web.  I have a hard time following 
everything.

Thanks,
