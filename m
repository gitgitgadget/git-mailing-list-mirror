Fair enough. If it's working, I agree there is risk in changing things.
And if you're willing to deal with the bugs, then I'm happy to stand
back. :)

I have a hunch that any policy you'd have to set for splitting is going
to end up becoming a policy you'll have to use when comparing (or you
risk violating the transitivity of your comparison function).

But that's just a hunch, not a proof. Again, I'm happy to defer to you
if you're the one working on it.
