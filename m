Oops, yes, of course. I'm not sure how I managed to fumble that.

Yes. :)

Without digging into the code, I had just assumed that flipped_block was
used as an array index. But it really is a boolean, so I actually think
"flipped_block = !flipped_block" would probably be the most clear (but
IMHO not really worth the churn).

Hmm, possibly. I guess that might have helped my confusion, and I do
think returning bool for function returns would help make their meaning
more clear (it would help distinguish them from the usual "0 for
success" return values).

I don't even know that we'd need much of a weather-balloon patch. I
think it would be valid to do:

  #ifndef bool
  #define bool int

to handle pre-C99 compilers (if there even are any these days). Of
course we probably need some conditional magic to try to "#include
<stdbool.h>" for the actual C99. I guess we could assume C99 by default
and then add NO_STDBOOL as an escape hatch if anybody complains.
