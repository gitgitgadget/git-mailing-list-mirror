Eh. I assume you mean me here. As I hinted at in another thread, I am
not sure I can commit to leading the project - just scratching an
itch. But I may be able to review pull requests and make some releases
from time to time... I probably won't work on code or features I don't
need unless someone funds my work or something. ;)

We'll see where the community takes us, I guess... Always better to have
more than one maintainer, anyways, just for the bus factor... Worst
case, I'll delegate to a worthy successor. :)
