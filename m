Makes sense. Originally it took "fatal" as a parameter, but it was split
into two functions in 12d6ce1 (write_file(): drop "fatal" parameter,
2015-08-24). The return value on the non-gentle version could have been
dropped at that point.

Arguably we could get rid of the gentle form entirely, as below. The
diffstat is certainly pleasing, but maybe we would eventually want it
for another caller. I dunno. I won't be offended if we drop this as
churn.

Subject: [PATCH] write_file: drop "gently" form

We have two forms of write_file(): one that dies, and one
that returns an error. However, the latter has only a single
caller, which immediately dies anyway (after producing a
message that is not really any more informative than
write_file's generic die(), and arguably worse because it
does not give the actual filename).

Let's convert that site to use the non-gentle form. At that
point the gentle form has no callers, and we can simplify
the implementation of write_file.

As a fun aside, this patch was generated using "--patience",
which gives a much closer to result to what I actually
changed than Myers diff (not meaningful to the patch, but
I'm just always on the lookout for cases where the
algorithms produce meaningfully different results).
