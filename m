GitHub is organizing a Git-related conference to be held April 8-9,
2015, in Paris.  Details here:

  http://git-merge.com/

The exact schedule is still being worked out, but there is going to be
some dedicated time/space for Git (and libgit2 and JGit) developers to
meet and talk to each other.

If you have patches in Git, I'd encourage you to consider attending. If
travel finances are a problem, please talk to me. GitHub may be able to
defray the cost of travel.

I hope to see people there!
