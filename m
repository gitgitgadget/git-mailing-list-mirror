You completely missed the point. You assumed that I said spitting 
everywhere is what Romans do. In fact, I said the opposite.

And you missed the point even more completely: there are societies, where 
spitting is not considered rude. If you are there, and you consider this 
rude, you are in for trouble.

So you missed the point utterly, therefore I repeat it here in more clear 
English: if you want to add a page as you do everywhere else in the 
internet also on the Git Wiki, then look around first, and see if others 
have behaved about the same. If not, don't (unless you are 
super-optimistic that your inflammatory self-promotion will gain you many 
friends). This is basic etiquette, not only in the nets.

As for the accusation that there was no explanation: this is false. I did 
not want to address this accusation because it is so plainly ridiculous, 
but it seems that everybody and her dog thinks "yes, Dscho is such a nasty 
person, he would do that, so let's assume that the other guy did not lie". 
In effect, all who keep this thread alive, reinforcing the accusations, 
getting emotional and stuff, are feeding the troll. And making sure that 
the task of keeping the Git Wiki clean is as undesirable as [censored]. 

So, sure, keep on going with this thread. I'm done.
