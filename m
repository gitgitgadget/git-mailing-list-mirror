I don't think this helps. The chosen-prefix lets you append hash data to
an existing file. Here we just have identical prefixes in the two
colliding halves. In the real-world example, they used a PDF header. But
it could have been a PDF header with "blob 1234" prepended to it (note
also that Git's use of the size doesn't help; the attack files are the
same length).

No, zlib doesn't help. The sha1 is computed on the uncompressed data.
