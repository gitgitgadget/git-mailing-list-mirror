Very unlucky.

I have tried to arrange a more consistent error code from the perl team. There are too many platform mods, and getting this particular change done won't happen - I have already been told something like "Sure, but in an RFE. We'll evaluate it.", which will mean 18 months minimum on x86 if approved (unlikely) and won't happen on the ia64 platform - ever. I think this is ultimately resulting from what is on the stack when the exception is thrown inside perl that is different on the platform. It did change - it was actually 169 two years ago with the same effect. Changing it will mean a custom mod to base perl - not likely going to happen.

What it we left the perl code as is and went with the following, since this seems to happen only above 128:

# Similar to test_must_fail, but just considers pass/fail on completion codes
test_perl_must_die () {
        case "$1" in
        ok=*)
                _test_ok=${1#ok=}
                shift
                ;;
        *)
                _test_ok=
                ;;
        esac
        if ! test_must_fail_acceptable "$@"
        then
                echo >&7 " test_perl_must_die: only 'git' is allowed: $*"
                return 1
        fi
        "$@" 2>&7
        exit_code=$?
        if test $exit_code -eq 0 && ! list_contains "$_test_ok" success
        then
                echo >&4 " test_perl_must_die: command succeeded: $*"
                return 1
        elif test_match_signal 13 $exit_code && list_contains "$_test_ok" sigpipe
        then
                return 0
        elif test $exit_code -eq 127
        then
                echo >&4 " test_perl_must_die: command not found: $*"
                return 1
        elif test $exit_code -eq 126
        then
                echo >&4 " test_perl_must_die: valgrind error: $*"
                return 1
        fi
        return 0
} 7>&2 2>&4

Then change t9001 to refer to this function instead of test_must_fail.
