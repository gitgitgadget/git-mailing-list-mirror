Nice. As a bonus, I noticed that Coverity complains about the use of
rand() as a security red-flag (even though of course we don't care about
its quality here). This should get rid of it by hiding the same thing in
a custom implementation. ;)

We have a similar LCG in t/helper/test-genrandom.c, but I don't think
there's any reason this needs to be factored into a shared one. And in
particular, I'd be loathe to change the genrandom one, as it may create
small bugs in the test suite (cases where we rely on hashes of the data
having particular attributes).
