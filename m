Hi Andrey,

on this mailing list, it is considered impolite to top-post, and it is
also expected to reply-to-all unless there is a very good reason not to.
Currently, you are trying to abuse me as a free help desk, which I do not
appreciate.

This time I am re-Cc:ing the mailing list and reply inline.

Okay, so you were lazy... ;-)

The idea of the "M" in "MCVE" is to make it easier for others to
reproduce. For example, if you test only with PHPStorm and do not bother
to test the plain command-line, then you are expecting others to install
PHPStorm just to help you. You see, some people might take that as a
perfect excuse not to help you at all! Count me in.

And if you reproduce on the bare command-line, you do not even need to
mention PHPStorm to begin with. But you do have to give a step-by-step
list of what you did and what you expected to happen and what happened
instead.

You see, you really *want* to make it easy for others to help you.
Generally a good resource is http://whathaveyoutried.com/ and I tried to
come up with a separate list of good advice at
https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/wiki/Issue-reporting-guidelines

In your particular case, I would also recommend setting the environment
variables GIT_TRACE=1 and GIT_CURL_VERBOSE=1 before re-trying and then
pasting the entire text from the console into a reply (*after* seeing that
nothing obvious sticks out).

Ciao,
Johannes
