 Dear All,
 
Apols for the newbie-ness of this post - I couldn't find a seperate
list/forum for user support.
 
I have no SCM for my projects and its becoming a nightmare. Lots of
folders lying around, with various versions.
Need to manage all this and do the work to catalog and archive the work
done so far and set up a good config mgmt framewrok for future work.
Been searching for an SCM and git seems good.
 
Before I create a repo of live files, I just wanna check:
 
(1a) 
Do I need to install windows git on the same machine I want to store the
files on ?
Or can I install git on my workstation PC and create the repo on the
server ?
 
(1b)
if i create a repo on my office PC, can it easily be moved (including
all history) to another PC (e.g. LAN server) if we decide to implement
git across the team
(If not, or its inconvenient, I need to create the repo on the server)
 
(2)
 if i create a repo on my work PC, can it easily be migrated (including
all history) to a repo on github (etc.) ?
 
(3) 
if I create a repo and commit the first baseline, can I later create an
ancestor commit to that baseline, if I subsequently find an older
version of the project lying around on the file system
(or, same concept i guess, if i find a project version that sits between
say version v1.0 and v1.1 (where v1.0 is the parent tag of v1.1) can i
interleave the project files as say v1.01.
 
I've a feeling the answer's will be YES to 1 & 2 and NO to 3, but the
documentation is too low level for a newb like me.
 
many thanks
