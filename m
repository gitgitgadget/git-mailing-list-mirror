It is the fact that we have ended up describing what needs to be done 
from having had the implementation problem. Thus we (accidentally) lock 
ourselves into a 'difficult to explain' situation.

No. That (as I read it, regarding the need for an initial slash) is the 
lock-in.

We should explain it from the other endÂ  - to anchor the pattern one 
needs a slash either at the beginning or middle.

We do get a reasonable number of queries to the list regarding 
.gitignore patterns which generally indicate that user have been 
confused and failed to understand the overall man page description (both 
leading and training slashes being somehow special but exactly how they 
haven't fully fathomed..) (and plenty on StackOverflow)

I'll ad some more feedback to Adam's side of the thread, and a possible 
alternate suggestion.
