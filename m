OK. That's basically exactly the same mode I work with, (but I prefer
the user to just send me that mbox file as a single attachment rather
than broken out into separate messages). If nothing else, it
eliminates the "select the messages" step.

And, sure I can see that where you need to aggregate dozens (or
hundreds or whatever) of separate patches to apply in one go, it's
really nice that you can do that. Personally, I'm not in that
situation myself. Though if I were, I'd still be happy to have each
patch-set submission be pre-aggregated for me. Maybe you're getting
that already with a single "select thread" operation or whatever.

Anyway, thanks for satisfying some idle curiosity on my part.

-Carl

PS. A separate reason I like attachments is that I like the subject
and message body to be the actual discussion of the patch, (and the
commit message and patch content to come later). I find that, (as
opposed to commentary being inserted between commit message and patch
content), more natural when a discussion on the mailing list turns
into a patch attempt. But I fully recognize this is a cultural
separation between my project and that of the kernel and git
projects---certainly nothing needing any debate.
