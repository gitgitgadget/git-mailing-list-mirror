I should also mention that in my (probably misguided) enthusiasm for
the Cygwin port, i proposed myself as the package maintainer on the
cygwin-app list. If people don't think i'm gittish enough to handle
it, i am more than happy let them take over. Otherwise i will attempt
to go through the procedures needed to get it into the Cygwin distro.

For those interested, a copy of the generated Cygwin packages can be found
at:
http://www.dspsrv.com/~timo/

If there are no objections, i'll send them onto the Cygwin people sometime
tomorrow.

Tim.
