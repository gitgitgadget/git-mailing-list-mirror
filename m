Broken pre-condition.  See the beginning of 2:

    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
    that you also meet all of these conditions:

Gitbox is not *modifying*, or creating a work *based on the Program*.
Separate copyrights.  The rest of your argument thus falls apart.

Bullcrap. See above.  Get your preconditions right, and I'll play along.

Chris> You can't make commercial works based on GPL licensed software.

Sure you can.  RedHat makes money somehow.  Don't play the "we must be
starving artists for the cause of GPL" on me.

Maybe you need better lawyers then.
