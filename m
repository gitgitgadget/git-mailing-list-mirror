I'm really sorry you used my argumentations and trasform them in a
full load of bullshi..t.

If I had only imagined somthing like this I would never posted in first place.

The man you can't even write his name correctly is one of the best
maintainers we can have. And we' ve been very lucky for this.

I can number a lot of reasons for this, but you really don't deserve it.

It's not a problem of how many patches you have posted, IMHO everyone
could express his ideas regardless of the weight of his contribute to
git.

But, also if you had posted thousand patches this don't give you the
right to speak like this.
