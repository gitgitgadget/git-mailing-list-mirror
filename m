Right.

Gcc emits an extra cltq instruction for x86-64 (Convert Long To Quad,
i.e. 32-bit to 64-bit) if we wrap explicitly and still use an int in
sha1_to_hex().  It doesn't if we use an unsigned int or size_t.  It
also doesn't for get_pathname().  I guess updating the index variable
only after use makes the difference there.

But I think we can ignore that; it's just an extra cycle.  I only
even noticed it when verifying that "% 4" is turned into "& 3"..
Clang and icc don't add the cltq, by the way.

So how about this?  It gets rid of magic number 3 and works for array
size that's not a power of two.  And as a nice side effect it can't
trigger a signed overflow anymore.

Just adding "unsigned" looks more attractive to me for some reason.
Perhaps I stared enough at the code to get used to the magic values
there..
