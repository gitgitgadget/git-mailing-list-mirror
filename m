I do not think you can get rid of that split, though. Different people
want different content from a site. Somebody who wants to download and
run git does not care about our Summer of Code ideas page. Somebody who
wants to get a logo does not care about seeing an in-progress logo
contest, or discussion on which logos people are working on.

Historically most of the "dev" information has been on the mailing list.
But sometimes it is more helpful to have a web page showing the "current
state" of some content (e.g., the list of SoC ideas) and just
periodically update it, rather than having each reader assemble the
current state from whatever has been posted to the list.  We have used
the kernel.org wiki for this in the past. What I was suggesting is that
those things could fall under the name "dev.git-scm.com" (which could
even just point to the k.org wiki, or some other wiki, or a site to
which many devs had push access).

The wiki has _also_ been used for user-facing content. E.g., the list of
tools that build on git. That kind of content would make sense to me on
git-scm.com, and perhaps it could be ported there to give it better
exposure.

Do you have a link to the poll or its results? I could not find one in
the list archive. Not that it necessarily matters to the current
discussion, but I was interested for historical curiosity.

I have also seen that logo receive unfavorable reactions from people,
but my recollection is probably biased because I was one of those
people. :)

Thanks, this is what I was trying to say in my earlier message.

I do not know if I count, as I am listed as one of the proposers in your
original message. But yes, I agree with this.
