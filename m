Dear diary, on Thu, May 04, 2006 at 03:01:33AM CEST, I got a letter
where Jakub Narebski <jnareb@gmail.com> said that...

Perhaps few bits but I think they were insignificant or just confusing.
:) (Like Cogito/StGit commands for cloning Git repository).

You could get there clicking on the Git logo, but I agree that this
wasn't very intuitive. I've added a link.

Good idea, added.


By the way, it has been suggested on #git that it might be worth sharing
the same color scheme between gitweb and the homepage. I have tried it
out but the gitweb's color scheme might be a bit too dull for the
homepage, dunno (I might also just already get too used to the bluish
theme).  Opinions welcome. It's the "Gitweb gray" stylesheet (in Firefox,
View -> Page style).

Thanks,

Right now I am having amnesia and deja-vu at the same time.  I think
I have forgotten this before.
