This is, of course, an artifact of Git's history. While Git itself is
reasonably old at this point, linked worktrees are a relatively recent
invention, and there had never been a reason to record the path of the
main worktree anywhere. Also, not recording the path allows the
project directory to be relocated easily if needed.

I don't think it's accurate to say that "you can technically name the
git directory what ever you want". The only _blessed_ name for that
directory is `.git/` if you expect any sort of automatic behavior
regarding repository discovery and determination of the top level of a
worktree.

Certainly, you're free to locate the repository elsewhere -- or name
it something else -- but when you do so, you knowingly give up the
convenience of the automatic behaviors, and instead have to rely upon
--git-dir, GIT_DIR and --worktree, GIT_WORK_TREE, and core.worktree,
which is why those exist.

(Rather than --git-dir, --git-work-tree and cousins, you could also
place a "gitfile" named `.git` in the main worktree referencing the
actual repository path, and by doing so regain all the automatic
behaviors. Alternately, `git init --separate-git-dir` could set this
up for you.)

At any rate, the above comments aside, as mentioned previously, a way
forward might be to teach git-worktree to consult --work-tree,
GIT_WORK_TREE, core.worktree when computing the path of the main
worktree. The fact that it doesn't yet do so is merely an oversight, I
think; one of the several such oversights during initial development,
some of which have already been corrected.

That might indeed be an improvement. Perhaps submit a patch making
this change?
