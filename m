Hi List,

So I was just sent a patch generated with 'git format-patch' that 'git
am' fails to apply correctly. It applies but part of the commit
message is lost.

The problem is that the commit message has lines like

--- Foo happened
    did some things to handle Foo
--- Bar happened
    Still processing update from Foo which led to a crash

git mailinfo seems to discard everything after the first '--- Blah'. I
know ^---$ is special but I thought ^---.+$ would be OK. I know git
mailinfo shouldn't handle garbage input but I guess the problem I have
is that the patch was generated by git format-patch so surely git
mailinfo (and therefore git am) _should_ handle something generated by
generated by git format-patch.

Do people agree with my thinking? I'm not sure if it would be
appropriate for git format-patch to produce a warning or for git
mailinfo to tighten the matching of '---'.

Regards,
Chris
