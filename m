  Hi,

  as a reminder and quick invitation, there will be quite some
Git-related stuff going on at the Ottawa Linux Symposium 2006 between
Jul 19 and Jul 22.  The schedule is available at:

	http://www.linuxsymposium.org/2006/schedule.php

  Of particular interest for the local population should be the Git BOF
session on Wednesday afternoon that Junio and me will hold. If you want
to discuss Git as its users or as its developers, we are looking forward
to meet you.

  Furthermore, on Thursday early afternoon there will be three Git
events in a row! First I will try to gently introduce (Co)git(o)
to the newbie audience, then in another room Junio will give a talk
about how Git feels like and how maintaining Git feels like, and then
the crowd will scurry back to the tutorial room to watch jdl showing
the raw power of lowlevel git unleashed.

  Happy summer,

				Petr "Pasky" Baudis
