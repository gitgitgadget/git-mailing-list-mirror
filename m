Makes sense.

Is it worth having:

  void clear_object_flags_from_type(int type, unsigned flags);

rather than having two near-identical functions? I guess we'd need some
way of saying "all types" to reimplement clear_object_flags() as a
wrapper (OBJ_NONE, I guess?).

The run-time check is maybe a little bit slower in the middle of a tight
loop, but I'm not sure it would matter much (I'd actually be curious if
this approach is faster than the existing traversal code, too).
