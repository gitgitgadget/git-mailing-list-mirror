Right, but next week the links will be different. This time the links
where not really from this week, but they will be on the next
iterations.

Somebody could pick the relevant links and add them in the wiki.

I asked in the mailing list and the only comment I got was: go ahead.
So yeah, that doesn't look like an "official" blessing, but it's not
bad either.

Anyway, my idea is that many gitsters will participate on this blog,
it's not my personal blog, I already have one.

Who wants an account?

It's the week number.

True, "Git weekly links" sounds better?

Exactly, I didn't choose them, that's what people have been tagging as
"git" in delicious.com. I'm subscribed to the RSS feed and saving the
ones that appear a lot.

In fact I don't like some of them, but that's what the "public" finds
interesting.

It's popular, and a lot of people find it interesting. /me shrugs

Right, but it is to many people.

Thanks for the comments, but gathering all these links is already
taking me more time that I wished.

My objective is to do this weekly. Maybe I'll put the links in a git
repo so people can see them before I make the post. Would you find
that useful?

As an example of possible links for next week:
My RubyGems development tools and workflow
http://drnicwilliams.com/2008/12/05/my-rubygems-development-tools-and-workflow/

Pushr, or the application will deploy itself
