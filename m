Interesting...  I found a big improvement with public-inbox
just using bitmaps; but have never tried the hash cache.

Right.  Our documentation seems to indicate JGit just warns (but
doesn't fall over), so maybe that can be considered separately.

I've never used JGit myself; and was satisfied enough with
bitmaps alone that I never tried the hash-cache.

As far as serving clones and fetches, public-inbox-init has
always created bare repos with bitmaps enabled, but without
the hash-cache for compatibility concerns.

That's a lot of fetches and clones over the years.

Thanks for the review!

Subject: [PATCH] repack: enable bitmaps by default on bare repos

A typical use case for bare repos is for serving clones and
fetches to clients.  Enable bitmaps by default on bare repos to
make it easier for admins to host git repos in a performant way.
