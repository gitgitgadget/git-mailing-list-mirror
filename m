This is probably because of SIGCHILD comes before "sleep". I believe this is
unrelated to the hang issue. The hang issue looks like something is wrong with
cleanu_children(), or maybe in the child which it tries to kill and wait, not in
tests.

As for this zombie issue, could be fixed with, for example, more busy wait like
the following. It may with some bigger probability miss SIGCHILD to the first
sleep because there is a bit more to do before it. But the penalty is only 1
second now, and as it still happens rarely there seems to be no visible
degradation.
