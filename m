I wasn't disputing that of course.  However, the same effect can be
achieved in using a single hash with a bigger length, e.g., sha256
or sha512.

I agree.  However, what is the actual cost in practice of detecting
collisions?

I get the feeling that it isn't that bad.  For example, if we did it
at the points where the blobs actually entered the tree, then the cost
is always proportional to the change size (the number of new blobs).

Is this really that bad considering that the average blob isn't very
big?
