Yeah, I agree that is problematic. But I do not think it is a
fast-import bug, but rather bogus output generated by bzr fast-export (I
am not clear from what you wrote above if you are considering it a bug
that fast-import is confused). It seems nonsensical to mention a file
both as a rename source and as deleted in the same revision, and
certainly I would not expect an importer to deduce a link between the
second line and b/b.
