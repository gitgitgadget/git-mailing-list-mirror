Hi There,

Some mishap had happened with my project:
I found a piece of code that is the most recent one that never got commited to
the repository. It is dated December 5th and it definitely is the most recent 
piece of code. 
Now in the mean time I switched computers so I had to reinstall git and get
create new local folders. Now this directory with the most recent code, shows
every file as unversioned which should not be true. 
Only a couple, maybe 3 files had changed with that last change. Now when I commit
this now, is that gonna mess up my old repo or can I safely gio ahead and commit
that most recent code (even tho it might commit the whole folder) - it almost
seems like it forgot which files
were in the repo vs. which files were in my local folder...

Thanks for hints and suggestions how I get myself cleanly out of this mess!
Thanks,
Ron
