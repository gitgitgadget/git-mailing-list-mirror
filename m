Yeah, I always feel funny going in the opposite direction of
libification, as in this case. But having looked at the set of current
and potential-to-convert callers, I couldn't find a single one which
would want the gentle behavior. Any site which doesn't die also wanted
something else more complex (e.g., different open options).

So I think rather than loading down write_file() with options that will
make the simple callers harder to read, we are better off to keep its
implementation simple, and let people call its building blocks easily.

And I think we already have that; in my final version it really is just
xopen/write_in_full/close. So the non-simple sites can still make use of
those components.
