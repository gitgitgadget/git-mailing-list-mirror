I haven't seen anything on list 
(https://public-inbox.org/git/005501d58e14$07504990$15f0dcb0$@gmail.com/) 
and haven;'t looked any further myself.
cc'ing the list.

Have you managed any more investigation?
Or tried upgrading to the latest release v2.24.x (which may provide 
updated error messages)?

Have a careful review of error messages and see if you can correlate at 
least some of them with information you can find in your setup.

e.g. the first part of the error stream is "remote: fatal: not a git 
repository: '.'Â  "
This means the remote system is sending you a message that it is looking 
at '.' and hoping that it is a repository, but it isn't. So why is it 
looking (within the remote) at '.' - is that path something you sent?, 
it is a misconfiguration at the remote?, etc.

This may also be a bad interaction between cygwin and your Git (is it 
Git for Windows, or ..).
