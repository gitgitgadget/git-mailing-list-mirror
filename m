I think it's weired to have an option & config variable for Cc and not To.

Any MUA that does not cooperate with reading the To header is going to
give trouble with any header (e.g. Subject, Date).

Haven't got around to using git-send-email yet!

Mostly having to remember/lookup the email address.
