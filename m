Yeah, that "suffix" argument left me scratching my head at first. :)

Yeah, agreed. Once report_lines() (or whatever we call it) knows what
the prefix is, it is capable of handling indentation on its own either
by repeating the prefix or by computing its visual width and outputting
appropriate spaces (which we can probably never get perfect without
knowing about the terminal, but we could at least make an approximation,
or even use some ANSI magic -- we could even make it run-time
configurable, though I'm not sure anybody would care that much).
