Presumably the goal is to take better advantage of the hierarchical
namespace provided with the path component of the URL before dropping
to the query string.

Personally, I disagree, (at least as far as PATH_INFO---my feelings
aren't as strong for the action parameters).

A current problem I have with git is the difficulty of publishing a
new repository to the world. With our current setup on
freedesktop.org, for example, I have to publish 3 separate URLs
depending on how users might decide to interact with my repository,
(one for gitweb browsing and two separate URLs for doing git
clone/fetch/pull over either git: or http:). Much of that can now be
fixed with configuration changes on our server---but anything git can
do to simplify the amount of configuration is definitely appreciated.

-Carl

PS. A secondary problem is the difficulty of publishing a new
branch. But if I can get the 3 URLs above down to 1, then I could
probably live with the user having to figure out how to combine the
repository URL with the branch name, (in different ways depending on
what the user is doing).
