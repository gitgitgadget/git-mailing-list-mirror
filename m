Hey all,

Sorry about the delay grub decided to be 'helpful' which delayed me a
bit.  Anyway the system is up, it's finishing up grabbing all of the
updates but it should be in a reasonably usable state.  So if you don't
mind getting kicked off for 10 minutes more sometime later this evening,
to reboot into the latest kernel, master is open for business.

Git has already been reported as non-functioning and that is being
looked into.  If you have further problems, report them on the
kernel.org admin IRC channel, or e-mail ftpadmin.
