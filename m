There's a bit of subtlety here which makes the term "invalid" somewhat
vague. The refname "refs/heads/HEAD" is allowed by plumbing, as we try
to maintain backwards compatibility there. So the current prohibition is
just within the porcelain tools: we won't allow "git branch HEAD"
because it's an easy mistake to make, even though you could still create
it with "git update-ref".

And naturally we'd want the same rules for "refs/heads/@". I think it
might be worth adding "...in plumbing" to the end of the subject, and/or
calling out this distinction in the text.

It might also be worth mentioning some of the reasoning about the test
you put in your cover letter, since that content is not otherwise in the
Git history. I'm thinking something as simple as:

  Note that we are reversing the result of the test in t3204. But as the
  comment there notes, it was added only to check that "@" was not
  expanded. Asserting that the branch "@" can be created was only
  testing what happened to occur, and not an endorsement of the
  behavior.

I was a little surprised that the "delete branch named @" test
immediately below did not need similar treatment. But I guess all of the
"check refname" code in git-branch is split between those two cases,
because we want to allow cleanup of broken names created through other
means.

So I think the patch is doing the right thing. But it might be worth
mentioning this distinction in the commit message.
