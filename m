Oh, my hubris! I gave this a shot for some time this morning. This
will definitely take some work to do right. Just changing the callbacks
to return 'int' is a wide-sweeping change, but the place where they are
called already has an 'int' return that means something different.

I'm not saying this is impossible. It just takes more attention and care
than I can currently devote, given my other works in progress right now.

That fix is now available [1].

[1] https://lore.kernel.org/git/d1c4bbcaa9627068d5d9fbd0e4a2e8c8834a4bd3.1596646576.git.me@ttaylorr.com/

Again, the callback approach seems promising. The complexity is
stopping me from trying to apply it on top of the current
implementation, while I should be focusing on other things. I completely
believe that that approach is faster and more memory-efficient. I would
love to test and review a patch that takes that approach here.

Thanks,
