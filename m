More or less. I actually didn't look far enough to see under what
circumstances we might re-parse (or might not have parsed when we add
our extra refspec), but that's definitely the sort of thing I was
worried about.

Yes, I'd argue that the current code is buggy, since:

  x = remote_get("foo");
  y = remote_get("foo");

is a guaranteed leak. It seems like remote_get_1() should protect the
call to parse_fetch_refspec() by checking whether ret->fetch is NULL
(and ditto for ret->push).

Yeah, I think it's not that hard to support. I'd just rather have the
logic inside remote.c, rather than infecting the caller with the
complexity.

Doh, of course. I didn't think of that. That's probably a bad direction,
then, as there's no "just for this process" global config.
