It looks like the whole subdiscussion didn't reach git list. I also
read git through GMane NNTP interface, but it looks as if MARC also
shows only 4 messages in this thread (no subthread starting from
David reply). Junio, Alexandre, are you subscribed to git mailing
list; can you confirm if there is no copy of this (and previous)
messages via git@vger.kernel.org?

Perhaps VGER anti-spam filter went funky again (it happened).=20
postmaster@vger.kernel.org is to be pestered then.
