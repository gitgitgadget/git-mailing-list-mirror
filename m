IMO, the last GitTogethers had the right mixture between talks, breakout
sessions and free space for personal discussions.

The only thing that currently comes to my mind which could improve is
the long physical distance between conference, accommodation and evening
dining location. Shorter distances could probably be achieved more
easily in Berlin.

The most important thing for me were the direct discussions with other
developers.

I like the Berlin idea. I did not plan to attend the GitTogether this
year but if it was in Berlin I would do so. Maybe this is similar for
others that are not able to make the long way to Mountain View.
