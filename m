It emphasized an implementation detail too much for my liking.

And I would rather have some flexibility in the code as to _when_ it fans 
out and when not.

So I can easily imagine a full repository which has only, say, 5 notes.  
Why not have a single tree for all of those?

And I can easily imagine a repository that has a daily note generated by 
an automatic build, and no other notes.  The date-based fan-out just 
wastes our time here, and even hurts performance.

Ciao,
Dscho
