Cogito is more or less depreceted now. You should probably use git
itself.

You cannot "import" them, because they do not contain the necessary
information (commit message and email adress). But you can "apply"
them, and then commit manually. Use git-patch (even just "patch" could
do) to apply the patch, and commit as usual.
