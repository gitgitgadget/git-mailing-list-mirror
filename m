Its not off the table just because of what someone else proposed
as an ideas list for 2009.

A GSoC project is what the student makes of it.  You propose
something that you are interested in working on, that you think
you can complete in the time available within the program calendar,
and that the larger Git community would like to see implemented.

I think your post fell flat a few days ago with no replies because
it just didn't seem to invite any response from people.  Remember,
we're all quite busy with our own projects and lives too, just
like you are, and we do Git hacking/emailing in our spare time.
An email needs to be somewhat compelling and invite a reply in
order to get a reply...
