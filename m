Yes, exactly.

Yes, something like that would be extremely helpful!

In addition, it would be great to have a command that did the same
setup within an existing repository.

And I would be most happy if the two commands for these two use cases
shared as much syntax as possible, so I could publish one string and
users could cut-and-paste it to either command as appropriate.

One string I would have liked would have been "git://... ${branch}",
but existing git-clone and git-fetch command syntax is not too
amenable for that, (git-clone interprets an argument after the URL as
the name of the local directory to create while git-fetch interprets
the argument after the URL as a refspec).
