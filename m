To be honest, I like a lot projects made in C. I have been working with Qt and 
with Gtk and I must say that it is easy for me to understand Gtk that is in C 
than Qt that is in C++. Something I feel like if C++ design do unnecessary 
abstration. The thing is that due to my job, I am more familiar with C++ 
since the project in which I work at my job is a really big monster that 
seems to be easier to manage using an a litter high level language as C++ 
instead C.

I would like to learn more C, but sometime I think I should focus in one 
language and learn as much as possible about it.

Sometime ago I had to decide between C and C++. Looking around my city, it was 
easy to find a good job working for a big mega-application that for a small 
system application. It doesn't mean I like more working in high-level but C++ 
seems to have the best of both worlds. 

I will try to do things in C... 

Btw, more than strings I miss STL containers and algorithmits, but, if I want 
to join to contribute I know I must adapt myself to the rules. So, i will try 
to do thing in C.

Thanks
