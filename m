There are people on this list who know MediaWiki much better than i
do, so you don't need technical support from me, but i'll mention
anyway, that installing a Captcha extension, even a simple one such as
http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:ConfirmEdit , lowers automated
spamming.

And if the suspected spammer is a human and not a robot, talking to
him is better than blocking on sight.

Can anyone please unblock my account Amire80 and IP 132.64.34.38?
There are some contributions i want to make. Thank you.
