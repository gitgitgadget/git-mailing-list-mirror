You should swap this out for $PERL_PATH. You can use write_script() to
help if you're copying the script around anyway. Though it looks like
you just run it from the one function. So maybe just:

diff --git a/t/t5562-http-backend-content-length.sh b/t/t5562-http-backend-content-length.sh
index b24d8b05a4..90d890d02f 100755
--- a/t/t5562-http-backend-content-length.sh
+++ b/t/t5562-http-backend-content-length.sh
@@ -31,6 +31,7 @@ test_http_env() {
 		PATH_TRANSLATED="$PWD/.git/git-$handler_type-pack" \
 		GIT_HTTP_EXPORT_ALL=TRUE \
 		REQUEST_METHOD=POST \
+		"$PERL_PATH" \
 		"$TEST_DIRECTORY"/t5562/invoke-with-content-length.pl \
 		    "$request_body" git http-backend >act.out 2>act.err
 }

(note that it's normally OK to just run "perl", because we use a
shell-function wrapper that respects $PERL_PATH, but here we're actually
passing it to "env").

You could also lose the executable bit on the script at that point. It
doesn't matter much, but it would catch an erroneous call relying on the
shebang line.
