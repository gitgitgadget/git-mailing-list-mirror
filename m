Yeah, this seems impossible. If v5.4.27 is an ancestor of HEAD, then
that rev-list result must be 0 commits. I'd trust merge-base over
rev-list's limiting, as the latter can be confused by clock skew.

And indeed, doing:

  $ git log --graph --format='%h %cd' HEAD

does point to some weirdness:

The commit dates are very out-of-order: we go back to January (and even
to 2015!) for commits that are built on top of ones from last Saturday.
So while looking for a common ancestor with v5.4.27 (which is from only
a few days ago), I think we'd stop walking if we're left only with
UNINTERESTING commits (which these are, being ancestors of HEAD) that
seem to be from long before the last interesting one.

There's a slop-counter which is supposed to skip over up to 5
out-of-order commits, but that's clearly not enough here. Curiously,
bumping it to 100k commits isn't enough for this case! I had to bump it
to a million (effectively disabling the optimization entirely):

diff --git a/revision.c b/revision.c
index 8136929e23..cf585f375e 100644
--- a/revision.c
+++ b/revision.c
@@ -1085,7 +1085,7 @@ static void cherry_pick_list(struct commit_list *list, struct rev_info *revs)
 }
 
 /* How many extra uninteresting commits we want to see.. */
-#define SLOP 5
+#define SLOP 1000000
 
 static int still_interesting(struct commit_list *src, timestamp_t date, int slop,
 			     struct commit **interesting_cache)

I guess this depth might have to do with some weird topology between
linux-stable and linux.git (or maybe just something with your merge, I
didn't look too closely).

But my takeaways are:

One, whatever is generating this history is wrong. Author dates can be
out of order (and it is perfectly reasonable to do so to represent
cherry-picked or rebased commits). But commit dates should generally be
monotonically increasing. If you're applying old patches, etc, you
should be using the old date for the author timestamp, but the current
time for the committer timestamp.

And two, the clock skew issue is known in Git, and is an accepted
tradeoff for performance. E.g., "rev-list --count HEAD..v5.4.27" goes
from 43ms to 7200ms when I bump the SLOP value.

But the good news is that there's work towards correcting this. Instead
of using commit timestamps as a proxy for graph generation numbers, the
new commit-graph feature actually generates real generation numbers. So:

  $ git commit-graph write --reachable
  $ git rev-list --topo-order --count HEAD..v5.4.27
  0

which is the correct answer (and the rev-list runs even faster than the
SLOP version). The slightly bad news is that I needed --topo-order to
get that result. We're not yet using the generation numbers everywhere;
the issue is that they can actually be slower than commit timestamps
(timestamps, when they're accurate, have more resolution than generation
numbers, so they let us order the breadth-first search better). There
are plans to have the graph code use a "combined" number that stores
both a generation (for accuracy) and a timestamp (for resolution).
