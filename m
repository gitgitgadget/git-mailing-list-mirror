At first I thought your script found tests which _should_ have been
marked with a particular prereq but weren't. And I scratched my head
about how you would find that automatically. If we could, that would be
amazing. ;)

But it looks from the output like it just mentions every prereq that
wasn't satisfied. I don't think that's particularly useful to show for
all users, since most of them are platform things that cannot be changed
(and you'd never get the list to zero, since some of them are mutually
exclusive).
