Very true. Thanks for prodding me to this palpable oversight.

My error was to aim for a small improvement. I think the correct
approach is to improve the overall completion of git-checkout. IMHO it
is a completion bug that after giving a ref, completion will still offer
refs, e.g.
$ git checkout HEAD <TAB><TAB> --> list of refs

As far as I can see, giving two refs to checkout is always an error. The
correct behavior in the example above would be to offer paths instead.

I'll follow up with an improved version which considers these cases.
