Is that enough, though? Imagine I have:

  int foo(const char *x)
  {
     char *y = xstfrmt("something/%s", x);
     int fd = open(y, ...);
     free(y);
     return fd;
  }

Then errno is important if some caller of foo() checks errno after foo()
returns an error. And that caller might not even be in the same file.

In other words, it really depends on the contract of foo() with respect
to errno. And I don't think there is a way in C to specify that
contract in away that the compiler can understand.

Yeah, I guess the indirect callers of free() are really the flip-side.
My example was indirect users of errno. ;)

My biggest concern with it is that we'd have to remember to use it, and
there's not good compiler enforcement. But I guess coccinelle can help
us there.

My secondary concern is that it might make people think that xmalloc()
and xfree() are always paired, and thus you can do clever things in one
as long as the other matches it. But we sometimes free memory from
system routines like getline(). Maybe a scary comment would be enough?

These are perhaps worth fixing (though not if we come up with a
universal solution). But I'd be surprised if they are the only ones. By
its nature, this problem only manifests when there are actual errors,
and our test suite is mostly checking happy paths. So I'd assume there
are a ton of "if (ret < 0) { free(foo); return -1; }" spots that are
simply not exercised by the test suite at all.
