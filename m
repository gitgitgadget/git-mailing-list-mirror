I am a little late to this thread, but it really seems to me that the

Is that we are considering it a failure for "pu" to have pending
coccinelle patches. Are there any coccicheck transformations that aren't
just "we prefer to do it like X instead of Y"?

Changes that actually break things should be caught by the compiler
(either by their nature, or because we take care to rename or change
interfaces when making a semantic change to a function).

I think that's getting at what you're saying here:

I am mostly thinking of your first type here. And I think it makes sense
for people to avoid submitting code that does not pass "make coccicheck"
_as it was at the state of their branch_. But for cocci changes that are
in flight at the same time as their branch, I do not see any need to
strictly adhere to them. The code is "undesirable", not "wrong".

For the second type, I agree that we do not necessarily need to carry
them in-tree. Eventually the transformation happens, and nobody would
use the "old" way because it doesn't work anymore. Problem solved.

I do not mind carrying them for a while as a convenience to people who
will need to fix up their topics in flight (or more likely to the
maintainer, who will need to fixup the merge). But we should make sure
not to forget to remove them when their usefulness has passed.

Likewise, we should not forget to occasionally run "make coccicheck" on
master to make sure people have a clean base to build on. If Junio is
able to do that, then great. But other people can also do so and submit
patches (to go on their respective topics, or to be a new mass-cleanup
topic).

I guess there is some lag there if Junio pushes out a master branch that
fails coccicheck, because contributors may build on it before somebody
gets around to fixing it.

I've wondered if we could have a script that pulls a coccinelle snippet
from a commit message and runs it. It may be a hassle to find the right
commit, though (you'd start the procedure from "oops, my compile now
seems broken; what was the change that I need to apply to adapt?").

OK, makes sense.

This part seems tricky, though. There's a race condition between
promoting the patch from pending to not-pending and other topics
branching off. And remember that we do not always see other people's
branches, which they may work on in private for a long time (though I
suppose "when Junio applies it" is one effective cutoff).

I'm not wild about leaving these loose ends that need to be tied up
manually. It adds a lot of friction and effort.
