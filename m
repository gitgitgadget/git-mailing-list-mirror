OK, that makes sense, and this is indeed the way to do template files in
systemd.

The "%i" replacement is done on the contents of the template file
itself. So inside git-maintenance@.service, the ExecStart line specifies
that we should run "git maintenance run --schedule=%i".

This looks like a regression in systemd itself. I was able to bisect and
I left a comment there:

  https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/30172#issuecomment-1844699620

I don't really see a way to work around it within our test suite, short
of just skipping the "systemd-analyze verify" calls entirely. Hopefully
my analysis is right and they will fix it soon, and we can consider it
"not our problem" on this end. :)
