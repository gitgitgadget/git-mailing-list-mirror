Good idea on trying to separate the reflection part of the blog from the
actual final report blog. This way, you didn't have to worry about the
report getting too long due to the reflections ;-)

You could consider linking each of these to the other ones, though. That
would help tie things up.

Some other thoughts:

Dogfooding is one of those thing that's surprisingly effective at all times :-)

BTW, s/my millions/by millions/

Good to know that all are well. I resonate with what Zheing Hu says. Let's
hope we get through COVID-19 smoothly.

Very true. They are always helpful. I believe MyFirstContribution is
a testimony for this. It's glad to know you would like to help
contributors in that way :-)

Thanks and hope you have a good weekend too! Also, thanks for all
your contributions so far! Hoping to see more patches from you on
the list :-)
