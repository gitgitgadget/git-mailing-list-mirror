Hi All:
I am looking into using JGit from Java to get some files from source control
for an application that runs on AWS.
We currently use SVNKit and it seems to work fine. We recently made the
switch to git and I am having a hard time finding a sample that allows one
to 
(a) init or create a ocal repo with my credentials and path to the tree that
I am interested in...
(a) get a bunch of files from my remote repo 
(b) commit any changes back in...


I have searched through this list and have not had any luck.

If there is someone out there that can help me that would be much
appreciated.

thanks!
Sundarbun
