I don't have an opinion either way on what Windows would want, but note
that the function already _does_ convert separators to slashes. With
Johannes's original patch, you'd end up with a mix, like:

  \\server\share/dir1/file

So this conversion is really just retaining the original behavior, and
making it consistent throughout the path.

Which isn't to say that the function as it currently exists isn't a
little bit buggy. :)

One of the points of normalizing, though, is that Git can then do
textual comparisons between the output. So I think there's value in
having a canonical internal representation, even if the OS could handle
more exotic ones.
