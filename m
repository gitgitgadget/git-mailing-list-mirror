So this has been fairly quiet -- is anyone else coming? :-)

You should probably talk to Radisson Blu about their cancellation
conditions, so as to avoid some nasty arguments.  Their "Features" say

  Cancellations free of charge can be made until 4 weeks prior to
  arrival date.

while their "Hotel Policy" says

  Cancellation Policy:
  - Cancel by 6:00 PM hotel time on May 09 2013 = no penalty.

which is clearly contradictory.
