It seems that the week was quieter than usual, perhaps?

Many are rather old news.  People who know git world better, but do not
know how you are generating this list and for what purpose, may interpret
this as "Here are links I recommend you to follow and read this week" and
incorrectly think "why is this bozo listing these ancient news as this
week's?"

I do not think you would want that.  You may want to briefly mention at
the beginning of each issue (say two-line paragraph) how the links listed
here are chosen, primarily to explain that these are not hand-picked by
you, but culled from the public bookmarks, i.e. "what people are reading
this week" or something like that.
