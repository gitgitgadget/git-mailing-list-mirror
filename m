We do look at them in a few cases, like "fast-export", but only if they
are not marked UNINTERESTING. And add_rev_cmdline_list(), the variant
that writes the hex values, only ever gets called with the UNINTERESTING
flag.

So I think you're right that these ones would never be seen. I did
wonder if we'd ever show them with "log --source" or similar, but that
pulls the name from object_array_entry, I think.

This last paragraph is questionable, I think. We feed the argv from
setup_revisions() here, but that is not always coming from the actual
command line. Most cases seem to finish with the traversal before what
they've passed in goes out of scope, but not all. The call in
bisect_rev_setup() intentionally leaks the strvec (even though it
doesn't need to do so with the current code). The one in
cmd__fast_rebase() does clear its strvec after setup_revisions() but
before the actual traversal. I wouldn't be surprised if your patch
triggered memory problems there.

I don't think there's any point in making this static. It's not an
array, but rather a pointer to a string literal. That string literal
will remain valid regardless (the standard does not guarantee we get the
_same_ string literal every time, but that doesn't matter for our
purposes. And in practice it will be the same one).

Ditto here.

And I don't see how this changes anything at all. Our pointers will live
on, but the memory they point to is not affected.
