The whole approach taken by the suffix code (before your patches) leaves
me with the nagging feeling that the comparison is not always going to
be transitive (i.e., that "a < b && b < c" does not always imply "a <
c"), which is going to cause nonsensical sorting results.

And that may be part of the issue your 6/7 fixes.

I spent some time playing with this the other day, though, and couldn't
come up with a specific example that fails the condition above.

It just seems like the whole thing would conceptually easier if we
pre-parsed the versions into a sequence of elements, then the comparison
between any two elements would just walk that sequence. The benefit
there is that you can implement whatever rules you like for the parsing
(like "prefer longer suffixes to shorter"), but you know the comparison
will always be consistent.

It would also be more efficient, I think (it seems like the sort is
O(nr_tags * lg(nr_tags) * nr_suffixes) due to parsing suffixes in the
comparator). Though that probably doesn't matter much in practice.

I dunno. I think maybe your 6/7 has converged on an equivalent behavior.
And I am certainly not volunteering to re-write it, so if what you have
works, I'm not opposed to it.
