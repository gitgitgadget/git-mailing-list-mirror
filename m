This smells like a survey to me.  ;-)

We should put together something really short, and try to get folks
to answer it, not just from our developer list, but maybe also our
user communities.  Maybe something like:

	1: Are you interested in attending a Gittogether:
		[ ] Yes   [ ]  No

		If you answered no, you can give up on the survey now.

	2: Would you travel to Portland, Oregon for the Gittogether:
		[ ] Yes   [ ]  No

	3: What month/year would be best?
		Option list for next 12 months from Oct 08-Oct 09.

	4: What would you hope to see/accomplish while there?
		[ ] Instructor-lead Git training
		[ ] 24 hour hack-a-new-feature contest
		[ ] ... ?
		Enter other ideas: [  <big text box thingy>    ]

	5: Would you volunteer to help organize it?
=09
		Trick question.  Email blah@blah to indicate how you can help.

Enjoy your time away from the keyboard.  I'd be happy to keep a
patch queue for you to pick up from when you get back.

I think it would be after that.  I doubt we could put it together
with <30 days of notice.  Most people who would want to attend need
to book travel arrangements.  While its possible with 30 days notice
you can typically get better rates if you have more lead time.
