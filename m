Thank you, all good points. I will work on the wording
improvements based on your suggestions.

"Consider the following options:" should be on a new line and
get a "hint:" prefix, I will fix that.


As far as the danger to the user, I was talking about the fact that
the user doing "git reset --hard" is going to lose any uncommitted
work as well as any commits currently in the branch.

This makes sens, I did it this way because I wanted to get a remote and
branch name, not just hash id and it was difficult to get this information.
I will try to rework it so that it shares the code with the logic that 
determines
the divergence status.
Any tips on what's the best way to do that would be highly appreciated.
