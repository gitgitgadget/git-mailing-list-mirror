I think that it is better to require frequent interaction on the mailing 
list, or at least on IRC.

Blogging is nice for those who want to follow the progress of a project, 
but do not want to get involved.  In this case, it is even better than 
having the people discuss the issues of the project openly, as reading a 
blog does not require constant monitoring like the list does.

However, blogging costs time.

I think that in the case of Git, those who are interested are those that 
will work on (as opposed to "with") those projects, too.  So I think the 
time is better spent on the mailing list.

Especially given the fact that the interested parties can guide the course 
of the project early, i.e. before a blog entry would be written (just 
think about the Git.pm thing; both Lea's and Joshua's project could have 
benefitted from enhancing the existing Git.pm according to their needs).

My cent,
Dscho
