Precisely. I'd say either remove the (c) or replace it with the correct
symbol. As including the correct symbol requires selecting between an
8859 and 10646 encoding, one shows one's i18n-fu by including the =C2=A9 in
UTF-8.

Once this choice is firmly in place, the opportunties for excessive
character usage really flourish:
