Maybe. Dunno. Even with the suggested function comment, I still find
that the revised code has a higher cognitive load because the reader
has to remember or figure out mentally what `found` contains by the
`return found;` at the end of the function. Compare that with the old
code, in which the reader doesn't have to remember or figure out
anything. The final `return nr_found == 1 ? found : NULL;` condition
spells out everything the reader needs to know -- even if the reader
didn't pay close attention to the meat of the function. So, we each
have a different take on the apparent complexity.

The function is so small that the increased cognitive load (for me) in
the rewrite probably doesn't matter at all, so I don't feel strongly
one way or the other. Keeping the patch (amended with the suggested
comment) or dropping it are both suitable options.
