I don't think this is really that important. It's rare to have more than
a handful of refspecs, and they're short strings.

I think the two-arrays things is more important, because keeping them in
sync is error-prone. On the other hand, if the array are manipulated by
accessors, that keeps the complexity in one spot.

The lazy parsing is an additional headache on top of that, but that's
orthogonal. Without the lazy parsing, then a single add_refspec() would
be simple and keep everything in sync.

That I can sympathize with. ;)

The "turn a parsed refspec struct back into a refspec string" makes me a
little nervous, just because it needs to be the inverse of the parsing
function. So now we have two new things that need to be kept in sync.

If we forget the "storing it twice" argument, would it make sense to
convert the parallel arrays of items into a single array-of-struct?
I.e.:

  struct configured_refspec {
	const char *string;
	struct refspec refspec;
	unsigned parsed:1;
  }

I guess that may run into problems where we really need an
array-of-refspec to pass into sub-functions. So going further, could we
just have "struct refspec" store the text form it was parsed from?
