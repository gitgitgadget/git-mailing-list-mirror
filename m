Not unreasonable to be explicit at the call site.  Will update.

I note that branch.c already relies on this aspect of find_shared_symref().

And, now that Iâ€™m reading branch.c again, I see that it also has a 
worktree-awareness bug in its safety check, deserving of a third patch 
in this series.

$ git init
$ git commit --allow-empty -am foo
$ git worktree add wt
$ git branch -M wt main
   # correctly disallowed
fatal: Cannot force update the current branch.

$ git branch -M wt  # incorrectly allowed
$ git worktree list

/tmp/test     6de7a5d [wt]

/tmp/test/wt  6de7a5d [wt]

Alright.  (Of course, as noted in previous discussion, this error path 
is currently reachable.)

I can split the bare repository part into a separate test_expect_success 
step?  This duplicates some commands but maybe helps readability overall.
