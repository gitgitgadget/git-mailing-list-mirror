I'm glad you guys think so highly of my contributions, but I am
only a small cog in the big machine known as "git".  I just happen
to like very-fine grained commits for any changes, which skews my
commit count upwards a bit.  There are _many_ contributors in that
"Primary Authors" list on git-scm.com who deserve attention too.  :)

Well, here you could have spoken for me I think.  I do git because
I find it fun, rewarding, and challenging.  Though these days it
has been a little bit more work and a little bit less fun-challenge
as I am plowing through code for egit, but its a labor of love.

My contributions to Git are also about giving back, in return for
the benefit I have gained over the years from using Linux, and the
thousands of other open source packages that make it all work.
I'm not big on kernel hacking (though I did try it for about 6
months) so this is one way I can put a few pennys back in the open
source take-a-penny/leave-a-penny penny jar.

More recently I may be in a position where my new employer might
be able to make some contribution to the community through part of
my time.  I shall see if it winds up detracting from the fun aspect
of it for me.  Personally I tend to get so focused on something that
I have a very hard time moving away from it, and just want to focus
on that one thing and do it well.  Doing it at day-job may make
that easier, and reduce stress on me, in turn making it more fun.

I don't know how much kernel.org needs support, but we rely heavily
on kernel.org for our main distribution site of git.  Its a drop
in the bucket compared to the Linux kernel activity itself, but I
imagine that the right sort of Linux-friendly (and Git-friendly)
corporate sponsor could really help kernel.org out.  Of course only
so much help is really useful, and I have no idea what kernel.org's
financial (and staff time) situtation is like, so I'll shut up now.

Pasky's repo.or.cz is another huge area that the community relies
upon.  Fortunately Pasky has been able to offer its services freely,
but in the future it may reach a point where corporate support
for adminstration assitance, duct-tape development, bandwidth or
hardware, may be extremely beneficial.
