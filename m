I think this case was just never anticipated, and it's a bug. The
original patch-selection code was written for "add -p", and the
fundamental unit it works on is a hunk. We hacked around that to handle
deletions back in 24ab81ae4d (add-interactive: handle deletion of empty
files, 2009-10-27). But "add -p" would never see a new file, since we
only consider the set of tracked files in the index.

However, when it was extended for "checkout -p", etc, we could see new
files. I guess the right fix is something along these lines, extending
the deletion concept to new files:

diff --git a/git-add--interactive.perl b/git-add--interactive.perl
index c4b75bcb7f..9c8844434e 100755
--- a/git-add--interactive.perl
+++ b/git-add--interactive.perl
@@ -768,7 +768,7 @@ sub parse_diff_header {
 	for (my $i = 0; $i < @{$src->{TEXT}}; $i++) {
 		my $dest =
 		   $src->{TEXT}->[$i] =~ /^(old|new) mode (\d+)$/ ? $mode :
-		   $src->{TEXT}->[$i] =~ /^deleted file/ ? $deletion :
+		   $src->{TEXT}->[$i] =~ /^(deleted|new) file/ ? $deletion :
 		   $head;
 		push @{$dest->{TEXT}}, $src->{TEXT}->[$i];
 		push @{$dest->{DISPLAY}}, $src->{DISPLAY}->[$i];

which does do the right thing. But:

  - all of this is in the process of being rewritten in C, so it should
    probably go into add-interactive.c (it's not yet the default to use
    the C version, but it probably will be soon).

  - that still says "Apply deletion..." in the UI. We'd need to update
    the messages to differentiate the two cases.
