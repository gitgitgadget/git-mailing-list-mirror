Good catch, thanks.

Looks like Han-Wen is taking care of this (thanks!).

I'm happy to do one final update the doc in JGit to match what we end
up with and then replace it with a pointer to Git's copy once that
lands.

Yes, this was another major part of the motivation (avoiding the
complication of the "atomic" multi-ref updates to packed-refs that Git
and JGit had to learn).

For a single tag ref, peeling to a commit is not very expensive.  But
for batch lookups e.g. when serving a response to an ls-remote
request, it adds up, and having the peeled results recorded helps.

Yes, I think it would be better to explicitly say that Git will continue
to reject D/F conflicts for refs (*not* reflogs) even though the format
can support them in principle.

If we choose to permit them some day in the future, I believe that would
be a separate repository format extension and protocol capability to
avoid confusing old versions of Git.

The sentence about "no compression" covers the lack of prefix encoding,
so I suppose I agree.

Might make sense to say "full name" to convey that we're talking about
rev-parse --symbolic-full-name, not a relative path like symlinks
support.

I don't have a strong opinion.  It sounds like Han-Wen sees something to
explain there, so I suppose it would be nice to spell out.

(My take: reflog lookups are not on the critical path for most
operations; especially, random accesses do not need to be fast.  From a
performance perspective, the best we can do is to compress them well to
decrease I/O cost, hence there's not much value to alignment.)

The latter, "server operator" (GIT_COMMITTER_IDENT at the server).

Committer in commit objects is forgeable, hence wouldn't be very
useful here.

That's true, and a good idea for the next rev of the format.

Oh!  I'll take a closer look and then follow up.

Thanks for looking it over,
