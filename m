I think both students did a great job this year. I was especially
pleased to see the degree to which the students were present on the
list, posting patches early, getting review, and engaging in discussion.
That is how non-GSoC contributors work, and I hope it is how all GSoCs
will go in the future.

I also want to also say a special thank you to Matthieu. After agreeing
to sign up as the backup administrator, he basically did all of the
administrative work this year. Also how I hope GSoCs will go in the
future. ;)
