OK. I do not care all that much between BUG() and not-BUG here, since we
are unlikely to have a test where test_must_fail returning 0 yields
success. I guess the most interesting outcome is that we would notice a
bug in a test_expect_failure block.

This is a bit intimate with the magic 7 descriptor. I think it would be
cleaner to trigger the bug in a sub-test. We do have helpers for that,
like:

diff --git a/t/t0000-basic.sh b/t/t0000-basic.sh

 test_done

This is modeled after other similar tests. I find the use of
check_sub_test_lib_test_err here a bit verbose, but I think we could
also easily do:

  grep "bug in the test.*only .git. is allowed" bug-fail-nongit/err

Note that there are some other cases which could likewise be converted
(the one for test_bool_env, which I noticed when grepping for "7>" when
investigating the first patch).

Holy double-quoting batman! I do think using $SQ or just "." (if using
grep) to match single-quotes makes things more readable. Obviously not
something you're introducing, but perhaps worth addressing as we touch
this test.
