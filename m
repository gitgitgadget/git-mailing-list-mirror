Instead of using stash as part of your normal process, consider using topic branches instead. Before working, switch to a new topic branch. If you forget, stash, switch, apply, then go forth. While on the topic branch, you can use add and commit on a hunk or file basis to satisfy what appears to be the requirement here. You can then merge the desired commits from your topic branch into wherever you want to merge them either preserving the commit or by squashing commits together.

In my shop, stash is only used for the "I forgot to switch to a topic branch, oops" process. I try to encourage people not to use it. I also discourage squashed commits, but that's because I like knowing what's in my sausages ðŸ˜Š

Cheers,
Randall
