Because efficient removal of elements is easier to implement with
chaining, according to 6a364ced49 (add a hashtable implementation that
supports O(1) removal).  khash.h deletes using its flags bitmap.  We
didn't compare their performance when entries are removed so far.

Admittedly I wouldn't touch hashmap.c, as I find its interface too
complex to wrap my head around.  But perhaps I just didn't try hard
enough, yet.

You can't use KHASH_DECLARE and KHASH_INIT together, as both declare
the same structs.  So I guess the idea is to have a header file with
KHASH_DECLARE and a .c file with KHASH_INIT, the latter *not* including
the former, but both including khash.h.  I didn't actually try that,
though.

Perhaps we can fix that with little effort (see below).

Fair enough.  How about this on top?  (The khash.h part would go in
first in a separate patch in a proper series.)

NB: I stuck to the 4-spaces-tabs formatting in khash.h here.
