But it's not an "intro", it's a user manual. That means it's supposed =20
to be a comprehensive, in-depth treatment of just about everything. =20
The technical content is a good thing; it's supposed to be the =20
document you turn to when you want to move beyond superficial use to =20
genuine, in-depth understanding.

There are other documents with the goal of "introducing git to the =20
new user", grouped together here:

<http://git.or.cz/course/index.html>

And also under the "Documentation" heading on the Git home page:

<http://git.or.cz/>

Those are probably the articles that should be worked on and =20
augmented if you care about introducing things to a newbie.

Cheers,
Wincent
