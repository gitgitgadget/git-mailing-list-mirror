hmm... I'm not an rss guy.  so not sure for anything.

at least, the link you gave me points to the rss 2.0 spec site I put
in the log as "RSS v2.0".  that can be seen as "more trust'able"

also, in the rss 2.0 spec site, you can find 2.0 sample under "Sapmple
files", which contain _escaped tag_ in <description>.

that's all I can say :<  can any one help?
