Makes sense. I think that, for now, I'll keep some sort of status quo
and "copy" (as opposed to "move") development over to GitHub. We can
then make dumps when new releases are done over there. If that proves
impractical because of changes in the build system or some other reason,
I'll send patches to clear the code from core and replace it with the
suggested .txt file.

Thanks!
