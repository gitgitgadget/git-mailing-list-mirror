Interesting, thank you for the announcement; it would be good to note
that it's not open-source.

I think a lot of people wonder now, how does this compare to existing
solutions; from your announcement I thought it's something like
Gitosis/Gitolite, but in fact it seems more similar to Gitorious or
GitHub (if it was publicly available, of course); perhaps it would be
good idea to present comparison to these on the project homepage.
