One result of this approach is that developers of different trees
don't necessarily have common revision IDs to compare. Imagine a
question like:

	When you ran that test did you have the same code I've got?

In git, the answer would be determined by comparing revision IDs.

In bzr, the only answer I'm hearing is attempting a merge to see if it
introduces any changes. (I'm deliberately avoiding "pull" since we're
talking about distributed cases here).

And to comment on something mentioned earlier in the thread, there's
no need for "wildly complex" distributed scenarios. All of these
issues are present with developers working together as peers, (and
each considering their own repository as canonical).

A harder question (for bzr) is:

	Do you have all of the history I've got?

(The problem being that when one developer is missing some history and
merges it in, she necessarily creates new history, so there's never a
stable point for both sides to agree on.)
