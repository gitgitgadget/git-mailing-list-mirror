Thank you for this thoughtful and personal response. I appreciate you
sharing your perspective, and I think that it is helpful, patient, and
powerful.

I want to echo this as much as I possibly can. Language has meaning.
Sometimes intentional, sometimes unintentional; but words matter, and
words can hurt. Changing the name of the default branch away from
'master' is not intended to solve all of the world's problems, nor will
it. But, it's a small thing that we *can* do to make a difference in
*this* project.

If we take the argument that our efforts here are being wasted because
of other uses of 'master' in the English language, then nothing will
ever get done since everybody will always be waiting on everybody else.

Doing this is the right thing to do. It is *easy* for us to do, given
our extreme privilege, and it should be done.

Thank you for highlighting the many ways that language and our choice of
words matters and affects people. I understand that this is a deeply
personal experience that you are sharing on the public mailing list, and
so I thank you for your courage in using your voice to do so.

I think that I am on a slightly different topic by now, but please note
that this change does not *break* anything. It doesn't force people to
change the names of their branches. Any user of Git is welcome to name
their branches however they like, so long as they accept the
consequences of doing so.

Thank you. It is for exactly these situations that the CoC is useful.
Nobody--certainly not you--is trying to force any ideology on anybody.

The CoC should serve as a reminder to us all that there are people on
the other side of our emails, and that we should treat those people with
respect, and as we would ourselves wish to be treated.
