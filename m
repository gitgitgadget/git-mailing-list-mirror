Yeah, that seems reasonable.

TBH, if making things in the middle step work turns out to be too hard,
I'm not entirely opposed to a hard switch.

The "does not work with 2.0" thing has to be a temporary step, though, I
think, since using the older versions will get harder and harder as time
goes on. I think it's OK to take such a temporary step as long as we
understand where it leads (and presumably its to directly generating the
roff with asciidoctor). The middle step of having asciidoctor+xmlto
helps us understand and isolate which changes are responsible for which
parts of the output.
