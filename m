There is always http://gitrss.q42.co.uk/announce.rss which extracts
"[ANNOUNCE]" emails from git mailing list into an RSS feed, for those
who prefer this way of watching for git news.

It's just that somehow for "Git Development Community" a mailing list
is enough.  We don't have official git blog, we don't have bugtracker
(issue tracker).  At the beginning git didn't even had _homepage_.


A propos blogs: Elijah Newren writes from time to time about git
on http://blogs.gnome.org/newren/ ; I think this blog is in a few
GNOME planets, so if he were so kind as put announcement there
when the time comes...  It would be good to have such announcement
on some blog which is in Perl blog planet (Perlsphere and/or Planet
Perl Iron Man), and similarly for other communities which rely on
blogs (KDE, Ruby: anyone?).

There is also http://www.versioncontrolblog.com (which is currently
off-line, so I can't check who to contact).
