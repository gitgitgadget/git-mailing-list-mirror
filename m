You can read an article. And you can publish the contents in your own 
words (you do not violate copyright by that). That is a fact.

And I do not buy into your "(and of the GPL)" thing. Either I get the 
copyright, which the GPL is based on, or I don't get the copyright (but 
still get that the GPL is based on it).

Ciao,
