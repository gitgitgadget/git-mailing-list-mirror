Hello, I am somewhat new to git and I was asking a lot of questions in
#git without properly checking the manuals or knowing enough about
linux. I want to apologize for my behavior and explain that I will do
everything on my part to help answer the question on my own and read
the documentation.

I really do need help with git and #git seems the only place I can turn.

Would it be possible to have the ban removed?
I've spoken to charon already and have taken his recommendations.
Thanks
Jim
