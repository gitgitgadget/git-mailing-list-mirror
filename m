Generally Shawn has coordinated it through Google right around the
GSoC stuff.  Junio works there now too, so I assume one of them would
want to but if they're swamped or something, I would be happy to set
it up at a nearby place.  The mentor summit is 22 & 23 October, so
right after is the time we would normally do it (24/25).
