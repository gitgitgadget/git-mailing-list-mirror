Nicely explained. I didn't re-verify your inspection of
apply_all_patches(), but I think it would be fine regardless. We don't
init_apply_state() again, so both before and after your patch we are
always looking at the "same" lock struct (and so if somebody forgot to
unlock, in either case we'd hit the "this tempfile is already active"
assertion).
