Hmm.  I had to read this several times to understand it.  Maybe something 
like this instead?

\--first-parent::
	When you want to preserve merges, this option allows you to rebase 
	only the commits which were not merged in, i.e. which are in the
	first parent ancestry of the current HEAD.
+
This option only makes sense together with --preserve-merges.

Also, could you please add a test case to make sure that your patch works 
as advertised (and that this functionality will not be broken in future 
commits)?

Thanks,
Dscho
