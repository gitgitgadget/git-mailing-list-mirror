The workspace on my server is currently "checked out" so I get the big
warning message every time I push to there.  What is the best way to
cleanup that working area so I can push to it without the large
warning every time I commit.  I know I can set a config variable to
squelch the message but that isn't what I want to do.  I want to make
the workspace on the server _not_ be checked out.

Thanks for the help.
