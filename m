Would the same have happened if someone like Randy Dunlap or Linus
himself had created an account, added a link to their blog or whatever
to their user page *before* making contributions? I'm guessing not.

This is quite common practice on the 'net. I personally think that,
before one goes and advertises one's site on some else's (and let's
face it, with zero contributions in your history, that's what it is -
advertising), that you should contribute something of more value
first, but that's just my personal opinion. However since this is
clearly disliked on the Git wiki, user pages should either be disabled
(which is quite easy to do) or there should be a *disclaimer*
somewhere that this sort of behaviour will not be tolerated. Somewhere
like, oh I don't know,
<https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Git_SCM_Wiki:General_disclaimer>
(which is, quite helpfully, blank).

Banning users without letting on what the rules are isn't very polite,
or productive for that matter. Unless the goal is to drive folks away
and stop them contributing... which is what wikis are there for
(outside contributions), right?
