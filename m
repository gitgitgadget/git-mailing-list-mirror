It's about providing a set of sane defaults for less(1), which other 
utilities also do, including dmesg, for example.  Of course, everyone 
can set $PAGER or $GIT_PAGER to fit their own prereferences.

I'm not sure what do you mean by the non-cleared remains being chopped 
off...  Could you clarify that a bit, please?

As I already mentioned above, everyone is free to configure the pager 
behavior in any way they like.

I'm afraid that I don't understand very well are you complaining about 
the presence of "-F" or not?

AFAIK, there should be no motivation other than not clearing the screen. 
  Other utilities that invoke the pager internally configure the default 
pager options in a very similar way.

Quite frankly, I can't stand scrolling in less(1) using the mouse wheel, 
but I do understand why some people like it.
