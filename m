This is actually slightly less tedious than I had imagined it to be, but
still pretty bad. I dunno. If somebody wants to tackle it, I do think it
would make the world a better place. But I'm not sure if it is worth the
effort involved.

These kinds of int/size_t conversions are the ones I think are the most
valuable (because the size_t's are often used to allocate or access
arrays, and truncated or negative values there can cause other security
problems). _Most_ of them are harmless, of course, but it's hard to
separate the important ones from the mundane.

It's nice that the cast here shuts up the compiler, and I agree it is
not likely to be a problem in this instance. But we'd probably want some
kind of "safe cast" helper. To some degree, if you put 2^64-1 in your
"umask" value you get what you deserve, but it would be nice if we could
detect such nonsense (less for this case, but more for others where we
do cast).

I think a helper could make things less awful here, too. Our xsize_t()
is sort of like this, but of course it dies. But I think it would be
possible to write a macro to let you do:

  if (ASSIGN_CAST(pmatch[0].rm_eo, size))
	warning(...);

This is definitely a rabbit-hole that I've been afraid to go down. :)
