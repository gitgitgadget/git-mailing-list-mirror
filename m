       Free Food!  Free Movies!  Free Software!

Come watch the newly released PeepCode screencast on Git,
Linus Torvalds' distributed source-code management system.

The plan is to munch on pizza, then watch a PeepCode video,
with occasional pauses for questions, etc.  Reactrix uses
Git extensively, so we can answer _some_ questions.  We're
also hoping that some helpful wizards may show up...

This inaugural PeepCode & Pizza gathering is made possible
by the generosity of PeepCode and Reactrix Systems.  The
meeting will be held at the Reactrix offices in Redwood City
from 6-9 pm on Tuesday, December 4.


About Git

Git is a distributed source-code management system, written
by Linus Torvalds and used since 2005 on the Linux kernel.
In his fun, opinionated Tech Talk, Linus explains why fast,
reliable, and (most of all) distributed SCM systems rock:
