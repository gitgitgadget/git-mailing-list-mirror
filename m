Thanks, noted. Will update it.

We could also use a flag file. Here's how it works:

If the file `.git/info/generation-number-v2` exists, use gen2.
Otherwise use gen1.

We can, of course generalize this to `<dir>/info/generation-number-v2`
if needed.

1. It is independent of commit-graph format. 

2. Switching between versions requires creating/deleting a file, which
is simpler than reading commit-graph file and modifying (or removing) a
metadata chunk.

Johannes used a similar flag file during the conversion of difftool [1].
