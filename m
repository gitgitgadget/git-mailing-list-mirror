The problem with this question is that it is free-form question (and
not single or multiple choice one). With more than 3000 responses to
last year survey free-form questions are not summarized till now. 
I'd rather limit number of free-form questions to absolute minimum.

Hmmm... I wonder if the trend would continue, and we would get around
15,000 responses to this year survey (if there would be one)...
