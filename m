Erm, sorry.

[svn-remote "svn"]
        url = svn://svn.<name>.com
        fetch = trunk:refs/remotes/trunk
        branches = branches/*:refs/remotes/*
        tags = tags/*:refs/remotes/tags/*

(URL changed in case it annoys my employers)

I didn't write this by hand: it was generated by git-svn init.

That's why I suggested that a method involving detecting branches based
on whether the directory is a copy of trunk or another branch might
'magically' work in all scenarios. I've used a similar branch 'scanning'
technique before for a different reason. But I realise there may be
technical reasons as to why that might not be possible.
