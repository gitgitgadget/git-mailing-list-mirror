In general, I like it. The git-branch documentation already talks
about "remote-tracking branches" so I've rewritten a couple of
sentence below to use that same terminology. Also there are a couple
of grammar errors related to pluralization, (likely the fault of
English being quite a bit less consistent than other languages with
subject/verb number agreement, etc.).

      renaming remote 'master' to local 'origin'), the new approach
      puts upstream branches into local "remote-tracking branches"
      with their own namespace. These can be referenced with names
      such as "origin/$upstream_branch_name" and are stored in
      .git/refs/remotes rather than .git/refs/heads where normal
      branches are stored.

Should be "more than one remote repository.". Also I'd add, ", (see
the new 'git remote' command)" before the end of that sentence.

Again to use the same terminology, "does not show the remote-tracking
branches.".

The 's' on "continues" is incorrect. Perhaps:

	continue to work (and will work in the future as well).

or just drop the parenthetical phrase.
