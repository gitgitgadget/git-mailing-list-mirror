We're going to use "handle_using_name_hash_icase()" to lookup both
qualified (with trailing slash provided by the daemon) paths and
unqualified paths (either a file or a directory on a platform that
can't tell), so there are 3 cases to worry about.

If we fail to find a cache-entry in the name-hash, we know nothing
about the path and we still have the three cases to worry about and
we let the caller deal with that.

If we DO find a matching cache-entry, then it is either a tracked
file or one of the new sparse-directories cache-entries.  We now know
the correct case-spelling.  I don't think it is possible for the UC
to have an entry for this spelling, so you're right, we may not need
to explicitly invalidate the UC here.  I'll add a comment to the code
about this.

name-hash.[ch] has 2 distinct hash-maps inside it. The "name-hash"
that we typically think about. And a well-hidden "dir-name-hash"
in the same source file.

The "name-hash" maps each cache-entry's pathname to its ce* in
the cache-entry[] (case-insensitively).

The "dir-name-hash" maps each unique directory prefix over all
of the cache-entries to the case-correct prefix.  That is, if the
index contains "dir1/Dir2/DIR3/file1" and "dir1/dir4/file2", the
dir hash will have 4 entries
     { "dir1", "dir1/Dir2", "dir1/Dir2/DIR3", "dir1/dir4" }.
This lets us do lookups without having to do a linear search on
the entire cache-entry[] every time.

These 2 hashes are demand-loaded only when needed (and usually only
when ignore_case is set IIRC).

When "handle_using_dir_name_hash_icase()" is called we still don't
know if the pathname is actually a file or directory, all we know
is that we did not find a case-sensitive exact match nor a
case-insensitive match against the cache-entry[] using the name-hash.
The pathname could be a (unqualified) directory or just a plain
untracked file.  So here, if we find it in the dir-name-hash, we now
know that it is a directory and that there was a case-error and we now
know the directory's correct case-spelling.

So we use that discovered case-correct spelling to invalidate the
untracked-cache.

I'll make it a BUG().

In an earlier commit, I moved the call to invalidate the untracked-cache
into the two handle_path_with[out]_trailing_slash() functions so that
we wouldn't have to worry about it here.

I'm afraid it will be very noisy. On Windows and Mac we'll probably end
up falling back for anything that is untracked, unfortunately.  That is,
if there is no cache-entry for "foo.obj", then we'll look for a
case-error (maybe there is a tracked "FOO.OBJ" file in the index or a
"Foo.Obj" directory), before we can say it is untracked.

I'm not happy about this (and no, I haven't had time to measure the
perf hit we'll take), but right now I'm just worried about the
correctness -- I've had several reports of stale/incomplete status
when IDE tools change file/directory case in unexpected ways....

Thanks
Jeff
