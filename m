I mostly meant that as a "I don't have the time to work on a large  
project like that because I have to do other things for work".  And I  
actually have non-computer related things to do when I'm not  
working.  Shock and horror.  ;-)

I hack on Git because I use it for work (yay being a contractor and  
getting to pick my own tools!) and periodically need to fix a problem  
here and there.  If I had more time, I'd probably do more.  But as is  
small things I submit patches, large things I go "Please fix this".  :-)
