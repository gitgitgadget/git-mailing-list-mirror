Actually, can you expand on that?  I don't see the escape hatch you
speak of.

`git hash-object` doesn't want to even create such an object ("fatal:
corrupt tag"), and I had to pass `--literally` to even create the
object.

`git update-ref` doesn't want to even acknowledge the object to create
the ref pointing to it ("fatal: cannot update ref 'refs/tags/badtag':
trying to write ref 'refs/tags/badtag' with nonexistent object HASH"),
and I had to `echo HASH > .git/refs/tags/badtag` to create the ref.

And then `git fsck` (even with `--no-tags`) complains about the object
("error: HASH: object could not be parsed: .git/objects/HA/SH").

It is my reading of the code that `parse_tag_buffer` will always fail
to parse such an object, and so `fsck_walk_tag` and `fsck_walk` will
always bubble up an error.
