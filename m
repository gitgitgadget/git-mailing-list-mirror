IMHO the result is easier to follow. Except for one case:

where I think the logic just ends up repeating itself. I guess you were
anxious to try to get rid of active_cached_changed, but I don't think
keeping it around is really that big a deal (and certainly another trick
is to just say "the_index.cache_changed").
