Because the sequencer can fast-forwarded to second from first it does 
that and then run 'commit --amend' to do the reword.

As second has been updated the sequencer cannot fast-forward to third so 
it cherry-picks third and then passes --edit when it runs 'git commit' 
to commit the cherry-pick. HEAD is updated once the reworded commit has 
been created.

I think the scripted rebase always ran cherry-pick and then ran 'commit 
--amend' afterwards if the commit was being reworded. The C 
implementation is more efficient as it avoids creating an redundant 
commit but has the side effect that HEAD is not updated before the 
reword which was surprising here.

I don't think I've ever looked at HEAD while rewording, my shell prompt 
gets the current pick from .git/rebase-merge/done so does not look at 
HEAD. While it might seem odd if the user looks at HEAD it's quite nice 
not to create a new commit only to amend it straight away when it's 
reworded. We have REBASE_HEAD which always points to the current pick - 
HEAD is also an unreliable indicator of the current pick if there are 
conflicts.
