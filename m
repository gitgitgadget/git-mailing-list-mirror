We do redefine ntohl(), etc in compat/bswap.h. Looking at them, I'd
think the result would end up as a bswap instruction, though. And
indeed, trying to feed that to godbolt results in the same output you
got.

It does sound like older compilers were benefiting from the unaligned
versions. Building with gcc-4.8 (from debian jessie in a docker
container on the same machine), I get ~6.25s with the unaligned load
versus ~6.6s with the bit-shifting code. So that's the opposite of how
the newer compiler behaves.

Benchmarking clang-8 (which your results showed doesn't handle the
shifting version well). It likewise is just _slightly_ slower after my
patch (11.47s versus 11.57s).

Given that newer compilers behave the opposite way, and the overall
small magnitude of the impact, I'm still comfortable with the change.
It's nice to have a better understanding of how the compiler is
impacting it (even if I am still confused how anything at all changes on
the newer compilers). Thanks for digging.
