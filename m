Hi,

I unfortunately have to work with several cvs-repositories and was
wondering if there was a way to have the files processed on import:
- strip trailing whitespace
- convert to newline-only line endings

Knowing git there probably is already a way to do that - I'd appreciate
any rtfm-pointers ...

Many thanks in advance

best regards
