OK, then here's the whole thing. I ended up with a few more cleanups,
too. This is all on top of GÃ¡bor's patches. It's conceptually
independent, but the textual wrangling was annoying enough it didn't
make any sense to require you to do it again during merging. ;) Plus I
do not think either topic is high-risk nor urgent enough to worry too
much about one blocking the other.

The diffstat is scary, but it's mostly the final patch, which is pretty
mechanical.

  [1/4]: t0000: keep clean-up tests together
  [2/4]: t0000: run prereq tests inside sub-test
  [3/4]: t0000: run cleaning test inside sub-test
  [4/4]: t0000: consistently use single quotes for outer tests
