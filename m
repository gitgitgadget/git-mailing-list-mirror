bit contains various pieces and snippets from Linus' and your scripts and 
thus automatically falls under GPL. Maybe I should have stated that 
somewhere explicitly, but its a 800 lines bash script for crying out loud. 
The "GNU" part was actually more like a joke. If you feel offended by it, 
I am happy to remove it. Are there any trademark issues involved in using 
"GNU"?

Andreas

PS: Unrelated note. There is a GNU GIT project (some graphical file 
manager thing or so).
