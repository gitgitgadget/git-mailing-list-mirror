Specially with gmane and their ilk, which provide forum-like views,
including ads ;-)

One thing we have had discussions about in the past is that we don't
want to split users from developers. Developers are here, so let's
make sure users are guided here too. The approach of not splitting
user/dev lists is a very good one - even if controversial at times.

Make sure you read up on earlier discussions on a "git-users" list -
most of the considerations that apply against it also apply against a
forum.

cheers,
