Thanks for working on this (and cleaning up several messes that I left).

I've read through each and with the exception of patches 10 and 11, they
all look good to me.

For 10 and 11, I think you've convinced me that the current behavior is
buggy. I do wonder if the subtleties might be easier to understand as a
single patch, but I'm OK either way.
