I'd suggest that "| <program>" is made to work as "--color=auto" in
the current series, i.e. with the coloring escape sequences stripped,
which is the safe approach because we don't know is "<program>" capable
of handling those escape sequences, while implementing support for
"--color=always" would be left for a follow-up series.  Using ">" for
that future command makes sense to me, because it suggests an output
redirection in raw form.

Of course, the plain "|" should still leave the coloring escape 
sequences
intact, because the configured pager (or the default pager, configured
by Git internally) is expected to handle them properly.

I'm glad that you like it. :)

Ah, I see.  It looked a bit strange. :)
