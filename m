My preference would be the latter, which I vaguely indicated in my last
email to Martin. Like I said, I think that the number of hypothetical
cases that we're breaking is pretty small, if not zero, and so I don't
feel too worried about changing the behavior like this.

If others feel strongly that keeping '--no-split' functional in the
classical sense is worthwhile, then I'm certainly happy to introduce
'--split-strategy' as another option, but I think that we agree that the
simplicity is worth the tradeoff here.
