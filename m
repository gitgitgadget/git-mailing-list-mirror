Yes I agree the change is worthwhile but I think it would benefit from 
an updated commit message.

Alphabetical sounds reasonable, we could sort on the non deprecated 
names with stop and ask grouped together

drop;;
     ...
keep;;
     ...
stop;;
ask;;
     ...
     `ask` is a deprecated synonym of `stop`

Thanks, I'd missed that those were context lines in the diff.
