So I don't see the value of such a list. You can go to delicious and
get it. Another thing that could be great is filtering this list to
those that pass a certain criteria (mainly quality, up to date, ...)
and present it in an attractive way, with summaries, categorized by
type (trick, tutorial, comparison,...), ...

Just my 2cents
