Don't think that.  Some people used to CVS still say "it does the job,
and I know the tool", and look suspciously on those youngsters trying
push anything they did not even heard of (I'd push for git today, but
18 months ago all I had to push for was svn).  And only after months
of "here svn/git would have done better", and regularly showing off
gitk (git-cvsimport is not a panacea, but it helps), can they be ready
to hear.

But by then more people have been made to meet CVS because of a new
project using it, and it will take more time that we would like to see
it retire from the scene...
