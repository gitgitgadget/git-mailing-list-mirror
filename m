Good point. I don't know how dangerous those are in the real-world
(i.e., is POSIX leaving an out for some implementations, or are they
really unsafe on common platforms like Linux).

Yes, but I didn't want to touch each code site that creates a file,
which is a lot more invasive. I expect expanding to 4096 (or PATH_MAX)
would be sufficient in practice.

I'd also note that the current code isn't _remotely_ async safe and
nobody's complained. So I'm perfectly happy doing nothing, too. I care
a bit more about the tempfile.c interface because it's invoked a lot
more frequently.

No, I think that's how you'd have to do it. The implementation isn't all
that bad, but hitting every file-creation would be invasive. I'd
almost rather bail to exec-ing "rm -rf $dir", but we probably can't do
_that_ in a signal-handler either. :)
