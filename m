Thanks for the update. Looks good.

Minor niggle: On the download page, in the Binaries table, Cygwin is listed 
before msysGit. I'm under the impression that msysGit is what we really 
want to be pushing on Windows (it's faster, smaller, and less strange to 
Windows-people (i.e. less Unix-y)), so you might want to switch the order 
around.


Have fun!
