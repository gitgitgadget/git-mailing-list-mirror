So far the massive (annoying) Git breakage happened second time to me (*).
I would agree with you if it's rare to happen, to me it's like once per
~2 years. So, can you define what the tolerable period of time is when
I have to expect a Git breakage next time?

(*) First time it was a few years ago when out of a sudden Git started to pull
gigabytes of repositories without any need. It was annoying, but tolerable to
some extent. Current situation is not better form my user perspective.

So far don't you need to support current use cases?
