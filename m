Hi,

There is definitely no consensus.

Personally, I started to capitalize it as a reaction to business types 
(apparently you have to turn in your sense of humor when you get an MBA), 
who were not happy with the abbreviation "global information tracker" 
(which would merit an all-capitalization a la CVS) [*1*], let alone with 
the connotation as a British slang word.

Yes, in Open Source, we are used to crude, geeky humor, some of us even 
accept blunt mails, but we are embedded in a world that is called 
"reality".

In my experience, in this world it is much easier to tell people that your 
program is called "Git" ("could have been John, either") and be done with 
the questions.

Ciao,
Dscho

Footnote *1*: I tried once to reinterpret GIT as meaning "Git Is 
Terrific", but that did not fly too well. :-)
