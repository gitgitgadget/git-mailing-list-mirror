It's definitely helpful to have someone who is learning how things
works to point out deficiencies and (ideally) suggest improvements to
the documentation.  Most of us here either were around at the
beginning, or (like myself) have used git long enough that we *know*
how things works, and reading the manual with the eyes of a novice is
a skill that few experts have.  It's why tech writers are (well, should
be) paid the big bucks.  :-)
