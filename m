I don't think the usefulness of a language should be judged by hits on a
web site.

Personally I would like the Git client to be packaged with as few
dependencies as possible.  Right now that seems to require Shell, Sed,
Awk and Perl.  The documentation has other requirements, but a prebuild
tar file is available.

I would have the rest of the distribution be bundled as something
like "git-utils" which could have a subdirectory for each support
language.  Then one could even make available alternative
implementations of higher level utilities and people could decide if
support of a specific language was useful to them.

Most such extension code is simple, although more complex than suitable
for just Shell/Sed/Awk.  People in each language community could provide
code which meets the needs of their community, and the Git project
itself would not need to make (Solomon like) decisions about what
extension languages to support.
