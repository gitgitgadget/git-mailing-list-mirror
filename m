A prototype would require just a few lines of shell script, I guess..

A downside that was only stated implicitly: This method needs temporary
disk space for the clone, while the existing archive modes only ever
write out the resulting file.  I guess the required space is in the same
order as the compressed archive.  This shouldn't be a problem if we
assume the user would eventually want to extract its contents, right?

Archive-via-clone would also work with full clones (if shallow ones are
not available), but that would be wasteful and a bit cruel, of course.

Anyway, I think we should find a better (shorter) name for that option;
that could turn out to be the hardest part. :)

It could benefit from GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES, but I guess
typical users of git archive --remote won't have any good ones lying
around.
