Yes, I gathered from those posts that work was being done. But I don't see this
feature in the latest stable release (1.6.1.3), so I was wondering whether it
has been abandoned or whether I should be more patient. This feature would be
useful to us, so I just wanted to make sure it hasn't fallen through the
cracks...
