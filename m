Actually no: The changes were on a different local "remote" branch; otherwise
I wouldn't need the merge, I guess

Note: If you see the number of upvotes to the answer there, it seems I'm not
the only one who got confused. ;-)

Is moving commits from one branch to to another done without any new commit?
Just updating the refs, or what? I didn't know that.

So it seems a commit is something other than I'd expected: To me anything that
changes what "git log" outputs is a commit ;-) Or anything that chenges the
reflog...

No, it seems I didn't realize that a fast-forward actually is without a
commit.

Maybe (I'm unsure where the concepts are described best to check the current
version(s)) try to explain the concepts of "commit" and "fast forward" in some
greater detail. Maybe I was just expecting the wrong things to happen behind
the scenes. Maybe add a statement like "fast-forwards never create a new
commit, so --no-commit doesn't make sense when fast-forwarding."

Thanks for the explanations.

Ulrich
