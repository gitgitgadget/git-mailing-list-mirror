Elijah, thanks for your patience with this. I appreciate the time and
energy you put into understanding what I want to achieve. The questions
you are asking help me understand my proposal better myself.

It seems that I didn't do a very good job at getting my point across so
far, so I'll try again in a more structured way.

Let's begin by describing two very different user scenarios:

1) Stacked branches. Git supports these reasonably well for simple cases
through the "rebase --update-refs" command (and the "rebase.updateRefs"
config), but since they are not a first-class concept, git needs to rely
on heuristics to determine which branches are part of a stack. For
simple cases this works very well, but more esoteric cases can have
problems (e.g. a non-linear topology of multiple stacks that may share
common base branches and then diverge, in which case rebasing one of
them destroys the others; or degenerate stacks involving "empty"
branches either in the middle or at the top, in which case there's no
way to tell what the order of the branches is supposed to be).

2) Copying a branch, and rebasing it away from the original one (for
non-stacked branches, see below). The use case is that you have a branch
called topic-1 (branched off main), which is pushed and in review
already, with CI running on it, and you want to test whether it works on
devel, so you make a new branch called topic-1-on-devel off of topic-1,
and rebase it onto devel. You want to make a draft PR of that new branch
to have CI run on it, too, and of course you want to keep the original
branch untouched. For me and most of my co-worker that I have observed
in pairing sessions, the natural way to achieve this is as described
above: checkout a new branch, and rebase it where you want it to go.

Next I'll describe my goals, and my non-goals. I know I can easily
achieve 2) by simply not using --update-refs, but I like to have
"rebase.updateRefs" set to true by default because it is so useful, and
having to remember to use --no-update-refs whenever I do 2) is annoying.

So my goal is to make 2) work well (in the simple, non-stacked case)
even when "rebase.updateRefs" is true, while not making 1) work any
worse in the "normal", non-degenerate case.

I'm _not_ trying to fix the problems that --update-refs has today (I
briefly mentioned some of them above, but there are more), and I'm not
trying to make 2) work well with stacked branches. It would certainly be
nice if that would work too, but I don't think it can without
introducing branch stacks as a first-class feature in git, so I'll have
to live with not supporting that case well. It would still be a big
improvement for me without that.

I'll now go on to respond to some of your questions inline below, but
I'll skip some of them in order to not make this too long. Do let me
know if there are still open questions that I didn't address.

Only briefly, not permanently. I only described this to illustrate why
it never happens to encounter branch copies in the middle of a stack.

That would be the wrong way round. I want to leave the original branch
untouched, make a new branch and rebase that away from the original.

Wait, now you are really turning things around. You make it sound like
my proposal is responsible for what you call a "bug" here. It's not, git
already behaves like this (and you may or may not consider that a
problem), and my proposal doesn't change anything about it. It doesn't
"fix" it, that's right (and this is what I referred to when I said "I'm
fine with it"), but it doesn't make it any worse either.

If I understand you right (and if I understand the user interface of
git-replay right), then what I mean is the combination of all single
commits that are mentioned on the command line, plus the right side of
all A..B ranges that are mentioned on the command line. In my mental
model those are "the things that are being rebased" (please let me know
if that mental model is wrong), and I am proposing to exclude all
branches from updating that point to any of those and are not mentioned
on the command line, because they can be considered copies.

D, E, F, and I are updated, G and H are not; this seems very obvious to
me. D, E, and F because they are all mentioned explicitly; G and H are
not updated because they point to one of the "things-to-be-rebased", so
they are copies; I is updated because it is contained in E but does not
point at one of the "things-to-be-rebased", so it's part of a "stack"
(or whatever you want to call this topology).

It's a heuristic; we need a way to distinguish things that are part of a
stack from things that are copies. My heuristic for this relies on the
assumption that the stack is not degenerate in the sense that it doesn't
contain any "empty" branches in the middle or at the top of the stack,
otherwise it wouldn't be possible to distinguish the two.

All the refs that are mentioned on the command line, either as a single
commit or as the second half of an A..B expression. It may well be that
I have some misconception of how exactly git replay works, this sounds
like the most likely explanation for why we don't understand each other.

Yes, I can do that, and no, I'm not concerned about performance. We
already have all that data cached in memory anyway, so that's not a
problem. But this would only work for git replay, there's no way to do
the same thing for --update-ref. My goal is to offer the same features
both for the checked out branch (using rebase) and other branches (using
replay), and have them behave the same.

So my proposal is more about changing --update-ref, since I can solve it
manually for replay, as you described. However, _if_ we decide to change
"rebase --update-ref", then I think it would make sense to change
"replay --contains" in the same way, so that they behave more consistently.

It sounds like you value the property of being easy to describe higher
than doing the expected thing in as many cases as possible.
