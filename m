Yes, replace refs don't invalidate the concept of a cache. It just
means that you invalidate the invariants of the cache for a specific
view, so you need a cache which matches that view.

It has been several years, but I remember at one point having patches
that summarized the graft/replace state as a single hash, and only used
the cache if it matched that state. So you could actually keep a cache
for some set of replace-refs that you have, as well as a cache for the
case that you've turned them off, etc.

I don't think that level of complexity is really worth it, though.

There were a few iterations of the concept over the years, but the
pack-time one uses a separate file with the same name prefix as a pack
(similar to the way bitmaps are stored). The big advantage there is that
we can piggy-back on the pack .idx to avoid having to write each sha1
again (20 bytes per commit, whereas the actual data we're caching is
only 4 bytes).

We have a custom command, "git ahead-behind", where you can specify
arbitrary pairs of commits on stdin. But it's all backed by a function
which, yes, could be plugged into "branch -v -v". It caches any bitmaps
it needs, so if you are doing 100 ahead/behind comparisons against
"master", for example, it only has to find the bitmap for "master" once
(remember that we sometimes have to traverse to complete a bitmap when
a branch has been updated since the last repack).
