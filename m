I'd make the same argument against t0011. :)

I think there it at least made a little more sense because we truly are
hashing ourselves, rather than just copying out some sha1 bytes. But I
think I'd still argue that if I updated strhash() to use a different
hash, I should not have to be updating t0011 to change out the hashes.
