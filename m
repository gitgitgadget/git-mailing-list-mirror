That worked.  Thanks.


> No idea.  But why not use a real mail user agent?

Because I'm using git for work, on work time, so I'm using the work computer.  It uses "exchange" instead of a real mail server.  Perhaps there are better mailers that work with Exchange, but it might not do everything the "groupware" stuff does, and that would affect the team interaction.  Also, there is a matter of "group policy" which means I'm not in full control of my own machine.

The web is barely usable from here, too.  The censor is set up, I guess, to stop ordinary desktop users like secretaries and accountants from doing anything to their machine, so the very things I'm interested in -- Windows tools, development topics, anything under ftp: -- is blocked !
