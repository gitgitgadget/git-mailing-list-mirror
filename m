I am going to miss seeing patches and review from you tremendously.

As prolific as Peff has been on the mailing list for the past 15 years,
he has also spent a lot of effort behind the scenes at GitHub as my
manager. He has provided me invaluable guidance and mentorship over the
years, and given me the freedom to pick and choose interesting projects
to work on.

We were recently talking off-list about the projects that he and I have
worked on together, and I remarked that none of it really felt like
"work". I think it takes a special skill to create that environment for
people, and Peff certainly has that skill.

I am a better programmer and Git contributor directly because of Peff's
efforts. I am sure that anybody who has been fortunate enough to get
review or advice from Peff feels the same as I do.

I would be honored to serve on the PLC if that is something others would
be in favor of, too. I can talk a little bit about my background and
thoughts here in a separate thread from this one.

Yes, I have credentials to our Heroku and Cloudfare accounts, and (I
believe) write access to the git-scm.com repository on GitHub. So I can
help do some light triage there, and at least prevent the site from
bit-rotting.

I've been doing the post-release manual update and cache purging as part
of my usual release routine for the past several releases, so I don't
mind continuing to do that, either.

Please do ;). Enjoy your well deserved time off, and thank you.
