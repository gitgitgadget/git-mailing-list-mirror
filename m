That very much depends on which students. Some of our students are
already experienced programmers when the enter the school. If I manage
to attract such students, a group of 4 can do a bit more than
"extremely simple".

Depending "exiting for who" ... my first contributions to free
software were very trivial code, and I found it very exciting the day
I got 20 trivial lines of code of mine into GNU Emacs ;-).

So, the feature may not be exciting, but I think the experience for
students could be.
