If by "Just Published" you mean over six months ago, maybe.
Basically, the troll is Daniel Lyons, a Forbes writer who at every
opportunity tries to trash Linux.  Just ignore him; or better yet,
cancel your Forbes subscription, and a send a note to the Forbes
publishers saying why.  I've completely lost any respect I've had for
the Forbes magazine, partially as a result of the multiple dreck
masquerading as articles published by Dan Lyons.  Speaking personally,
I believe there are much better places for me to get my business news,
including Business Week and the Economist.
