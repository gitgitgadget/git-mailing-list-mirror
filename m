It's short enough to keep it in the glossary _and_ fix the old 
documentation.

Okay, okay. I stand corrected.

How about this:

working tree::
        The set of files and directories currently being worked on,
        i.e. you can work in your working tree without using git at all.

Sorry, I attributed these "moving suggestions" to the large and angry SCM, 
while those were your comments. Since Junio decided to keep the "topic 
ordered" form in his repository, I moved them around according to your

How many users are there? Probably many call git-pull-script anyway, 
right?
