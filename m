OK. I agree it raises the bar a little bit. Whether that matters or not
depends on your threat model (e.g., casual spammers versus dedicated
information seekers). I don't have a particularly strong opinion on
what's realistic, but I don't mind erring on the side of caution here.

It might be worth making a short argument along those lines in the
commit message.

As far as caching goes, my main concern is mostly that people who are
not using the feature do not pay a performance penalty. So:

  - if the feature is not used in the repository's mailmap, it should
    have zero cost (i.e., we do not bother hashing lookup entries if
    there are no hashed entries in the map)

  - as soon as there is one hashed entry, we need to hash the key for
    every lookup in the map. I'm not sure what the overhead is like. It
    might be negligible. But I think we should confirm that before
    proceeding.

They just need the objects that have ident lines in them, so:

  $ time git clone --bare --filter=tree:0 https://github.com/chromium/chromium

gets you there much quicker. I don't think that negates your point about
raising the bar, but my guess is that the threat model of "casual
spammer" would probably be deterred, but "troll who wants to annoy
specific person" would probably not be.
