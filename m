Hi,

We are small IT company from Ukraine.
We are developing our site at the moment and we'd like to use your logo 
in the list of tools we are using.
You could take a look at our markup: 
http://etoso.biz/technologies.html#

Could you please clarify if we are allowed to use your logo in that 
way.
Certainly, the image has a link to your web-site.

Please inform us if we broke some your terms and we'll remove it for 
sure.

Thank you for understanding.

Sincerely,
Oleksa
