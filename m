Hi, due to a hardware or firmware issue, my machine is currently crashing
rather a lot. If that happens around the time I'm performing any git
activity, it seems quite likely to cause substantial corruption of the
git state.

I've responded both by running sync(1) every 60 seconds and by pushing
work to github more frequently, but the latter isn't appropriate for
everything; twice recently I've lost a fair bit of work as a result.

Q: Is there a mode in which I can run git that would make it a bit more
robust against crashes, at the cost of being a bit slower?


The primary symptom is that files modified shortly before a crash show
up existing but zero-length after the crash. For source files I mostly
know what to do in that situation, but `git fsck` shows a lot of files
under '.git/objects' that are empty, which seems to make things hard
to recover:

% git fsck

Last time I checked out the previous state from github in a new
directory and was able to find and copy over most of my work before
continuing. On this occasion I did a `git stash save` shortly before
the crash, and I'm not sure how to get that back. I see Ren√© Scharfe's
suggestion of:
  git fsck --unreachable |
  grep commit | cut -d\  -f3 |
  xargs git log --merges --no-walk --grep=WIP
from a recent message, but that is only showing me an older stash item.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions,

Hugo van der Sanden
