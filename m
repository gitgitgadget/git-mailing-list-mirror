I think it makes sense to generalize this and split it up into two
features.

It's a frequent annoyance of mine in the test suite that I'm
e.g. running t*.sh with some parallel "prove" in one screen, and then I
run tABCD*.sh manually, and get unlucky because they use the same trash
dir, and both tests go boom.

You can fix that with --root, which is much of what this patch does. My
one-liner for doing --stress has been something like:

    perl -E 'say ++$_ while 1' | parallel --jobs=100% --halt-on-error soon,fail=1 './t0000-basic.sh --root=trash-{} -v'

But it would be great if I didn't have to worry about that and could
just run two concurrent:

    ./t0000-basic.sh

So I think we could just set some env variable where instead of having
the predictable trash directory we have a $TRASHDIR.$N as this patch
does, except we pick $N by locking some test-runs/tABCD.Nth file with
flock() during the run.

Then a stress mode like this would just be:

    GIT_TEST_FLOCKED_TRASH_DIRS=1 perl -E 'say ++$_ while 1' | parallel --jobs=100% --halt-on-error soon,fail=1 './t0000-basic.sh'

And sure, we could ship a --stress option too, but it wouldn't be
magical in any way, just another "spawn N in a loop" implementation, but
you could also e.g. use GNU parallel to drive it, and without needing to
decide to stress test in advance, since we'd either flock() the trash
dir, or just mktemp(1)-it.
