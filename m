Hi Junio

This patch for the documentation doesn't seem to be in rc2 of 1.8.1...

tonight I was explaining this feature to a small group of people and I
pulled the git tree to get the latest code.

The current tagged 1.8.1-rc2 doesn't yet have your improvement and after
trying to explain it, I think it should be improved even more ;-)

I'm sorry to say I don't have the time right now to make a proper patch,
but I'll try to expand below...

The gist should be that:
__git_ps1 can function in two modes; The "traditional" way with command
substitution. This mode is activated when the function is provided 0 or
1 arguments. The new way, activated by providing exactly 2 arguments to
__git_ps1 is intended for use in the PROMPT_COMMAND way of bash to call
a function before writing the prompt. This command can then be (and is
in fact) used to set/overwrite the PS1 variable.

Only in the PROMPT_COMMAND mode can you get a prompt with colors for the
various states of the git tree showing in the prompt.

An example for inclusion in the ~/.bashrc file is:
-----snip-----
PROMPT_COMMAND='__git_ps1 "\u@\h:\w" "\\\$ "'
GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE=true
GIT_PS1_SHOWCOLORHINTS=true
--------------

It turns out that it can be quite confusing to get your head around this
split personality of __git_ps1...

I hope you can somehow get this into the next release with some
improvement to the docs!

Cheers

Simon
