Hmmm... I haven't thought about this issue.  I certainly don't plan
for Git User's Survey 2010 to last longer than 2 months.  We can
always send / post reminders that the survey is coming to be closed.

The problem with duration of last year survey was that some announcemen=
ts
got delayed because of holidays.

I think that 15 August to 15 September, or to 15 October would be
good time (this is currently preliminary only).

O.K., you convinced me: I'll leave age, but not add gender.

The problem is with not going overboard with number of possible answers=
,
but we can always take results of previous survey as hint (though=20
I don't remember if free-form questions are analyzed yet)/
