Hi,

So far so good. In fact it the change to 'distributed' that has ruined 
Eric's Acton stamps that assume that the 'time' came from a single 
central server.

This bit will confuse. It is only the new commits in the different 
repositories that are 'unrelated'. Their common history commits are 
identical sha1 values, and the DAG links back to their common root commit(s)

If the sender tweaks their timestamps at commit time, then no one 
'knows'. It's just a minor bit of clock drift/slop. But once they have a 
cascaded history which has been published (and used) you are locked into 
that.


As noted previously. The significant change is the loss of the central 
server and the referential nature of it's clock time stamp.


If the action stamp is just a useful temporary intermediary in a 
transfer then cheats are possible (e.g. some randomising hash of a 
definative partr of the commit).


But if the action stamps are meant to be permanent and re-generatable 
for a round trip between a central server change set based server to 
Git, and then back again, repeatably, without divergence, loss, or 
change, then it is not going to happen reliably. To do so requires the 
creation of fixed total order (by design - single clock) from commits 
that are only partially ordered (by design! - DAG rather than multiple 
unsynchronized user clocks).


For backward compatibility Git only has (and only needs 1 second 
resolution).


The multi-decade/century VCS idea of a master artifact and then near 
copies (since koalin and linen drawings, blue prints, ..) with central 
_control_ is being replaced by zero cost perfect replication, 
authentication by hash, with its distribution of control (of artifact 
entry into the VCS) to _users_, from managers. Managers simply select 
and decide on the artifact quality and authorize the use of a hash.


Most folks haven't really looked below the surface of what it is that 
makes GIT and DVCS so successful, and it's not just the Linus effect. 
The previous certainties (e.g. the idea of a total order to allow 
logging by change-set) have gone.
