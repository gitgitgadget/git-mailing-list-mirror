I don't think we do. Going back to the original discussion:

  http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/136141/focus=136774

it was mostly just "hey, this would fail really confusingly if we ever
did, so let's make it safe".

The second strbuf_grow() is by definition a noop (which is why 81d2cae
works at all), but we do pay the size-computation cost.

Seems reasonable.  IMHO the main advantage is that one does not have to
reason about the double strbuf_grow() (i.e., that the strbuf_add() is
safe because we know its grow is a noop).
