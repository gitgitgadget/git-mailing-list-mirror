Yeah, this reproduces easily. The problem is that fread_buffer()
modifies "size" (if there are not enough bytes in the buffer to read),
so we cannot just assume it is "eltsize * nmemb" anymore.

I.e., we need to squash in:

diff --git a/http.c b/http.c
index 8dbc91f607..27aa0a3192 100644
--- a/http.c
+++ b/http.c
@@ -176,7 +176,7 @@ size_t fread_buffer(char *ptr, size_t eltsize, size_t nmemb, void *buffer_)
 	memcpy(ptr, buffer->buf.buf + buffer->posn, size);
 	buffer->posn += size;
 
-	return nmemb;
+	return size / eltsize;
 }
 
 #ifndef NO_CURL_IOCTL

The other conversions all look correct (there's a similar case in
fwrite_sha1_file, but it already does the division correctly).
