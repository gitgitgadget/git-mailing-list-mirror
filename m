As a contributer with a single commit I was happy to see myself appear=20
shortly on the list (yeah!). Ok, so I realize it is vanity and a little=
=20
silly... :-)

To me it makes sense to sort the entire list according to commits. Its=20
still easy to find anybody with search, and I find it appropriate that =
I=20
be towards the end. The commit sorting encourages me to move up the=20
list! :-D

And why truncate the list? I'd personally like to be back on the list=20
(vanity! - but true), bandwidth is relatively cheap, and there is=20
nothing below the list. I also think it makes the community look healty=
=20
and encourages contribution to see how many others contribute.
