I just posted a patch series[1] which enhances "git worktree prune" to
detect and deal with multiple worktree entries referencing the same
path.

Hmm, the message it printed complaining that you tried removing the
main worktree seems pretty accurate since that extra worktree entry
was indeed pointing at the main worktree. I suppose it would be
possible to have "git worktree remove" also perform "corruption
detection" so as to present additional information which might clarify
the complaint. Of course, if that is done, then it would make sense to
make all "git worktree" commands likewise report corruption. However,
I haven't convinced myself that we need to go that far. Anyhow, the
posted patch series[1] addresses the immediate problem.
