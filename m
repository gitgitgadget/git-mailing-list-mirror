Yeah, I could go either way on that, I think. I was thinking it might be
fixing other callsites, but it seems that nobody else bothers to check
for NULL anyway. But being in its own commit, we could explain that.

Yeah, I agree that would prevent segfaults (and is similar to what RenÃ©
proposed for tags with a similar situation). It does feel like a step
backwards in terms of lib-ification. But maybe it's a
belt-and-suspenders on top of trying to catch this case at the parsing
stage, too.

I'd agree with that, and I think it's sensible to take your patches with
the extra tree check. We can rip it out later if it becomes redundant.
