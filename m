Dear Professor

You can upload now your invited paper for our conference in Malta, August 17-19: www. wseas. org until July 27, 2015
OR
for our conference in Seoul, South Korea, September 5-7, 2015
until August 20, 2015. URL  www. wseas. org

Invited Speakers will have also publication in one of our 44 ISI/SCOPUS Journals, double time of presentation
and they will receive also Certificate from our Secretariat with their name as Invited Speaker.

Proceedings are published in Books and CD-ROM and will be indexed in all major indexes (SCOPUS, ISI, EBSCO, British Library, Zentrablatt, ACM, AMS, Scholargoogle, IEE(IET), etc...)

See interviews (Video) of our recent invited speakers in the third column of our web site (under: Bulletin Board)
As you remember we had invited you as Invited Speaker in these conferences with publication of 
the extended version of your paper in our ISI/SCI Journals (with Impact Factor from Thomson Reuters).

The Papers of our Guest Speakers will be published in our Books, Proceedings and E-Library as well as their extended version in one of our 44 collaborating ISI Journals. The last one is an important feature of our conferences and for this reason our conferences are more and more popular (see photos in our web site).

All the papers from our previous conferences (since March 2014) have been indexed in ISI (Thomson Reuters) and SCOPUS (through the conference proceedings
and/or the Journals that publish the extended versions after the conferences)
as well as in many other major indexes via conference proceedings and/or our 44 ISI (Thomson Reuters) journals and more than 20 SCOPUS indexed journals

Do not send your invited papers by email. Just upload them via www. wseas. org selecting the most appropriate conference
with the indication (in the Field "notes") INVITED-by-OLGA-NIKOLOVA
The invited papers are a small percent and are noted in the conference program as Invited papers with 30 minutes' presentation instead of 20 minutes' presentation of the regular papers.
You could also organize a special session with a minimum of 6 papers.
Special Session organizers participate free in the conference provided that their session will have at least 5 fully registered papers. In this case, they are also honored as Editors in the Books and Proceedings and as Plenary Speakers.

Contact me for more details: publications@wseas.org 

Many Thanks,

Olga Nikolova
