Hello list,

I'm trying to figure out how I can check which branches are used in a 
git push action while using the pre-push hook. In the man page the 
following is mentioned:

----<

Information about what is to be pushed is provided on the hookâ€™s 
standard input with lines of the form:

<local ref> SP <local object name> SP <remote ref> SP <remote object 
name> LF

For instance, if the command `git push origin master:foreign` were run 
the hook would receive a line like the following:

   refs/heads/master 67890 refs/heads/foreign 12345

----<

I cannot seem to reproduce this behavior with the push action. Only when 
pushing to delete a remote branch or pushing to a new branch gets 
created yields any success. I went as far back as git 2.9.0 (I can't 
build older versions of git), to no avail. The line in the man page 
seems to indicate git v1.8.2-rc0 was the first tag to have it (ec55559f).

Could someone verify that what I am seeing is correct behavior or that 
this is incorrect?

As stated, I experience issues on git v2.9.0, 2.40.1 (Debian) and also 
directly from source 2.42.0.rc0.26.g6ac35453d6.

Thanks,
Wesley

Why not both?
