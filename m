Right.

I'm not sure either. I had assumed this came from a --prefix argument to
git-apply, but it looks like it only ever comes from setup.c's prefix.
We seem to avoid empty prefixes there, but there are a lot of different
code paths and I didn't check them all.

Yeah. All of this is mostly me thinking out loud about whether we can
improve the existing code further. Don't feel like you need to spend
time on it.

I don't know that it's been spelled out. But if you do this:

diff --git a/setup.c b/setup.c
index 860507e1fd..48af25cac1 100644
--- a/setup.c
+++ b/setup.c
@@ -765,7 +765,6 @@ static const char *setup_discovered_git_dir(const char *gitdir,
 	if (offset != offset_1st_component(cwd->buf))
 		offset++;
 	/* Add a '/' at the end */
-	strbuf_addch(cwd, '/');
 	return cwd->buf + offset;
 }
 

lots of tests break horribly. So I'm content that we'd probably catch a
regression there, even if it's not spelled out explicitly.
