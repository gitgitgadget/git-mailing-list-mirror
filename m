Dear diary, on Sun, Dec 04, 2005 at 03:05:01AM CET, I got a letter
where Ben Clifford <benc@hawaga.org.uk> said that...

Thanks a lot. I've added the Cogito-related stuff to its contrib/
directory (just with a bit saner filenames). I will try to update them
as new changes appear in, but I would be grateful if you could please
notify me when you think I really should. ;-)

Thanks again,
