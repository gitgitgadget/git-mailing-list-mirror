The plan is to use it for git propaganda in some form or another. :-)

If the list decides that it could be a better official name or simply an
alias (currently the case if I configured it correctly) to git.or.cz (or
whatever the list comes up with) I will gladly act as a domain sponsor.

Also, as time permits, I would like to get more involved in creating a
great online resource for git users and what better way to do that than
"homesteading the websphere".
