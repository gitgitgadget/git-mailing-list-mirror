Yes, I did write those once upon a time. ;-)

It's the manual stash/unstash that I don't want though. I want to be
able to make this happen automatically when switching branches.

Yes, I do stuff like that as well. And often "reset HEAD~" instead of
amend, (always with a moment's pause as reset justly deserves).

Right, so that's just more evidence that this approach is a little
awkward.

Anyway, the stashing thing I want is a minor thing that should be easy
to fix in git, (as is everything we're talking about here I think).
