Thank you for resolving my confusion.

It's a hard problem! There are no _sure_ answers here, and what works in
some cases will probably not work in other cases.

In my opinion, walking commits is easy (easier with the commit-graph)
and walking trees is hard. We probably _should_ do more commit walking if
it helps avoid walking some trees.

With a new perspective on the problem, I think perhaps trying to solve this
problem with bitmaps is incorrect. If you want to use bitmaps for C..D and
you don't have any bitmaps in the range D..C, then maybe we should just use
the old-fashioned method of walking trees? In your examples above, the
new method would walk trees for the commits in {B, C_i, D_j} while the
bitmap method would walk trees for the commits in {B, C_i, A_k}. I would
expect the list of {A_k} commits to be the largest in most cases.

The approach here would be to do the commit frontier walk, and check for
commits with bitmaps along the way. If we don't find an UNINTERESTING
bitmap, then use the non-bitmap way instead. Perhaps worth a shot.

I'll bring up this code snippet again:

        /*
         * if we have a HAVES list, but none of those haves is contained
         * in the packfile that has a bitmap, we don't have anything to
         * optimize here
         */
        if (haves && !in_bitmapped_pack(bitmap_git, haves))
                goto cleanup;

In addition to this, we can fill the "haves" set with the commits
in D..C (with boundary) and then check if any of those commits have a
precomputed bitmap. If not, goto cleanup.

Thanks,
-Stolee
