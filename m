Not all utilities are available and not all utilities have all capabilities. lv is not available for the platform. less considers the data binary and displays what usually is displayed when you try to use it for binary multibyte. You get @^@- and such. It does not present the data in the correct character set for the user.

I am searching elsewhere for support on pagers, because this really is not an appropriate discussion for the git group to focus on, do let's drop this, please, as not worth continuing. My original request was more about how to set up the file attributes, difference engine, and the rest of the git infrastructure. The partner I am working with is doing this with git hooks, which I am not really happy about. Let's prune this discussion as not worthy.

Yes, this is totally unclear. Setting git hooks is possible but setting
LESSCHARDEF is not?

Is patching git acceptable or is that out of question too?

What are your requirements, exactly?

If your data is in fact UTF-16 how is SJIS involved?
