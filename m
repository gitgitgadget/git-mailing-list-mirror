  Personally, I think conflacting git and git svn like now fogs things
up a bit and may be confusing; I think it would be clearer to describe
the git svn usage separately, or at a separate section at the end. Do
not take me overly seriously, though.


  Anyway, I just added a pointer to the wiki page at the top of my
instance, where plenty of stuff still links. I think at points it's
easier to read and should not be *grossly* outdated at any point yet,
so I added a link to it to the wiki page too.
