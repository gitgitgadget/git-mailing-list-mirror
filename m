Yeah, good point.

Yeah, that might be less sneaky than this wrapper business. Or we could
just do a few basic wrappers. The non-portable bit in my wrapper
suggestion was the renaming of the old function. But if we accept just:

  real_foo() {
	... do stuff with multiple returns ...
  }
  disable_function_tracing real_foo foo

then that is pretty trivial to do with an eval. It does disallow your
"wrap all functions at once", but I think that is OK. We might want to
only do a subset anyway.

Yeah, it would probably make sense in the "push" half to check that we
are actually tracing at that moment.

I'd say probably wrong, though it likely doesn't matter that much in
practice.
