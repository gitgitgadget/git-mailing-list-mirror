Where is the evidence that you warned the user _before_ banning him?

The policy in wikipedia is to notify through the user talk page:

I'm not assuming anything, I'm just looking at the evidence, and the
evidence shows you blocked not only Amir, but a bunch of other people,
and any attempted discussion through the user talk pages has been
deleted by you.

So the evidence has been suppressed.

I find this behavior unacceptable in an admin.

I'd like to propose myself as sysop in order to make the wiki more
hospitable. I've done stuff in wikipedia, and have been involved in
some conflict resolutions. Some of the things I would like to do is:

 1) Encourage the use of user talk pages (not to be confused with user
pages) in order to foster communication within the wiki to have more
civilized and transparent conflict resolution
 2) Allow users to search deleted pages (if possible)
 3) Revisit old deleted pages, unblock accounts if appropriate, and apologize
 4) Add a patrol group[1], and encourage users to join it in order to
get rid of spam in a collaborative manner
