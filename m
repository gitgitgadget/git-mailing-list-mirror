Oops - used tag in a generic sense when discussing git -- not helpful.
Really - would put the hash of the development commit into the log message for
  the stable commit.

Ok. There are 2 things at play.... The repository contains code for an embedded
system with several subsystems (separate executables on separate processors). We
will be trying to keep testing schemes up to date with respect to the progress
on the code -- but (beyond unit/module tests), the scene will change over time;
and, users may not be able to run much form their local copies. Second, only 2
of us have used git before (and, while trying to get up to speed - I am a ways
from git guru-dom yet), while everyone else has been using visual sourcesafe for
many years.

I want others to merge their work into development sooner rather than later to
minimize their and my problem of untangling conflicts (or - you rebased while
you were sharing work with Jill and...). And, testing on their work may be limited
before they push to our main repository and some integration can be done.

I really want to create a linked list of the development branch commits that are
of interest (their working sets - not the commit objects themselves), and using the
commit object's pointer to its predecessor seems like it could just do the job.
(it wouldn't be the place to go to for history / useful log entries)

Thanks for that. I will.

Maybe I've misunderstood cherry-picking, but I've thought it different from the
list view that I've been thinking could help us (with merges and multiple
commits).

Hmmm - I'm imagining a rather sparse stable, with perhaps time-consuming
integration testing.
