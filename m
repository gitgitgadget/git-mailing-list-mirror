AFAICT this was done with "git blame", so it might be "derived" by a 
particularly SCO-esque interpretation of the word, but it is really the 
work of those people Shawn mentioned.

Besides, I do not think that there were any other authors anyway.

In any case, this discussion is already boring me mightily, so I will tune 
out,
