  to be honest, I'm kinda sceptical. It's not really clear at all to me
what added value would drupal bring, and there're plenty of downsides
(mainly around various additional maintenance costs) to balance out.

  I probably wouldn't be able to tend for a drupal installation
personally, since I barely get time to maintain even the current
simplistic web page.

  (But it isn't required that *I* run the homepage.  :-) And I certainly
wouldn't want to stifle "innovation".)
