I note that you use the word "sources" here, in the subject line as
well (as '--input=<source>'), and in the code as well (e.g.  the in
the error message "unrecognized --input source, %s").  I like this
word, I think the words "input" and "source" go really well together.

It's interesting to see that you stopped listing and went for "and so
on" right when it got interesting/controversial with '--append'... :)

It also supports the very inefficient scanning through all objects in
all pack files to find commit objects, which, sadly, ended up being
the default, and thus doesn't have its own --option.  Should there be
a corresponding '--input=<source>' as well?  (Note that I don't mean
this as a suggestion to add one; on the contrary, the less exposure it
gets the better.)

But here you suddenly start using the word "mode" both in
'--input=<mode>' and in '--<mode>'.

On one hand, I don't think that the word "mode" goes as well with
"input" as "source" does.

On the other, is '--append' really a source/mode, like '--reachable'
and '--stdin-commits' are?  Source, no: from wordsmithing perspective
it doesn't fit with "source", and being orthogonal to the "real"
source options while they are mutually exclusive seems to be a clear
indication that it isn't.  Mode, yes: it's a mode of operation where
no longer reachable/present commits are not discarded from the
commit-graph.

So I don't think that adding '--input=append' is a good idea, even if
we were call it differently, e.g. '--input=existing' as suggested
above.

However, I do think that '--input=existing' would better express what
'--input=none' in the next patch wants to achieve.
