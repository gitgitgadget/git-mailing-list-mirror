Hi all,

The large website has a developers-only version of the site published on a server, which is tracked by git.

I
only have to work on 1 file.  I'd like to work on it, test changes on
the dev site, work on it some more, then commit when ready.

Do I have to download the entire rep onto my laptop in order to do this?  I have read and read, but I am quite confused :)

Thanks for your help!
