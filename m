I noticed the following blurb in the Debian SoC announcement

>  Cameron Dale will expand a BitTorrent application to work
>  effectively with large, constantly updating collections of files
>  such as the Debian archive, and create a backend or proxy to the
>  Debian package distribution tool APT to access it.

this sounds like there could be a significant amount of overlap with the 
GitTorrent project (potentially to the point where GitTorrent could do the job 
that Debian is looking for)

if so you may want to talk with them and share notes if nothing else.
