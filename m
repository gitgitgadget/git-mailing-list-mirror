I'm absolutely certain I'm not the first person to have raised this
issue, so feel free to point me at the threads where I can get the
rationale... but: to me it looks like git's choice of terminology hurts
its adoption and learnability.  

For example, why couldn't the "index" be called the "stage" instead?
That, along with knowing that "git add" was a synonym for "git stage"
would have flattened the learning curve considerably for me.

Thanks,
