Based on my notes from the last time I needed to feed a bunch of
non-mbox, non-git-produced patches into git-am, the hard part was
figuring out how it split a file into separate messages; my notes say:

	"Finds lines begining with "From " and ending with "hh:mm:ss
	yyyy".  See builtin-mailsplit code for more details."

Other than that, I think it just needs and From: and Subject: lines to
get author and first-line of the commit.  the git-am man page has some
documentation of this.  It could probably use more.
