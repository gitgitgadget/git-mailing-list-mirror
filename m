I think it needs to be at least 2 days long for people coming from Euro=
pe or=20
farther, otherwise it might not be worth it for them to come. Or it nee=
ds=20
to happen during, after or before another interesting conference.

The Google Mentor Summit is in Mountain View:

- October 25(Sat)-26(Sun)
(http://code.google.com/opensource/gsoc/2008/faqs.html#0.1_timeline)

Maybe we can have the GitTogether also in Montain View just after that:=
=20

- October 27(Mon)-28(Tue)

so that the 3 mentors that come to the mentor summit just have to stay =
to 2=20
more days there.

Or maybe we can just plan something for next year.

Thanks,
Christian.
