  i've had to explain the logic behind this to people who really have
a tough time understanding this, and it's a concept that applies in a
lot of places (surprisingly).

  what trips people up is thinking they need to calculate the
probability that two or more people have the same birthday.

  no.

  what you want to do is calculate the ongoing probability that each
person's birthday is *different* from all the earlier ones. as in:

  * prob that 2nd person has a different bday is 364/365
  * prob that 3rd person has a different bday is 363/365
  * prob that 4th person has a different bday is 362/365

and so on, and as you multiply those together, it's right at 23 people
that the chance that that person has a different bday from all earlier
ones drops below 50%.

  what's neat is that this way of looking at things applies in a lot
of places.
