Yeah, I considered that (because I had seen Elijah do it; I didn't think
of it myself). I don't love it, if only because now the extra
MAYBE_UNUSED is a head-scratcher for somebody reading the patch. I think
it makes sense if the code will exist in that maybe-unused state for a
while, but here it's just going away immediately anyway. I dunno.

Otherwise segfault if the client just says "session-id". :)

To be clear, the old code behaved the same way. It's just that
has_capability() returned the empty string for this case instead of
NULL. I changed get_capability() to distinguish the two so that the
later fixes for "command=ls-refs=whatever" could treat them differently.

I didn't add tests for this case (nor for "object-format" without a
value), but we could do that if anybody cares.
