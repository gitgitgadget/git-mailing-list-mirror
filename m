That's fair.  So, here goes.  I don't particularly condone nor condemn
any of these.

- Just yesterday, I was starting a project at work.  I wanted to add a
  doc directory as a reminder to add documentation very soon.  I could
  not do this.

- I've worked with projects that use an obj, .obj, .obj-platform or
  something resembling this and have checked in this directory to make
  sure it exists for all.  Of course, a build system could be made to
  generate this directory when needed avoiding the need to check it in.

- A common practice I've seen with autotools is to use a config
  subdirectory for many of the autogenerated scripts.  If I'm not
  mistaken older versions would not create this directory if it did not
  already exist.  Checking it in was a convenience.

The bottom line is that I don't really see many situations where it is
absolutely necessary but it is a convenience.  Not supporting it may
seem like an artificial limit that really didn't need to be there.

I'll read up on the index file when I get the chance.

Cheers,
Carl
