Thanks for digging up the history here. Reviewing those it seems clear
that doing a full object_array_clear() is the right thing.

This all looks good to me. Since the main use of "leak_pending" seems to
be to clear commit marks, I have a feeling that a better API would have
been something like:

  /* normal setup and use */
  init_revisions(&rev);
  setup_revisions(&rev, ...);
  prepare_revision_walk(&rev);
  while (get_revision(&rev))
	...;

  /* optional, but sensible if there may be other callers */
  clear_commit_marks(&rev);

  /* actually free any held memory */
  clear_revisions(&rev);

which would imply rev_info holding onto the "old" pending list
automatically until we decommission the rev_info in the final step.

But that's obviously a much bigger change. What you have here looks like
a nice clean fix to the leak problems.
