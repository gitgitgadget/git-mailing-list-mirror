I looked these over, both source and rendered output (both with asciidoc
and with asciidoctor 2.0.10), and they all look good to me.

I think the delimited literal blocks are _slightly_ less pretty than the
indented ones, but this is the solution we've been using for cross-tool
compatibility (and I think it's intentional in asciidoctor to deprecate
the indented blocks, because there are just too many corner cases). The
delimited ones are also easier to write correctly.

Yeah, I agree that the change in 6/7 is an improvement (and 1/7 is an
obvious bugfix looking at the doc-diff using just asciidoc).

I can confirm that asciidoctor 2.0.10 has the same bogus output there
before your patches, and that 7/7 fixes it.
