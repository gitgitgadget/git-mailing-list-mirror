Version 0.2 of the code formerly known as parsecvs has just shipped as
cvs-fast-export.  Project page, with links to documentation and the
public repository, is at <http://www.catb.org/esr/cvs-fast-export/>.

I have some cvsps and reposurgeon patches to merge before I can get
back to the script wrapper.

The most foolish mistake we could possibly make would be to permit 
the conquered Eastern peoples to have arms.  History teaches that all 
conquerors who have allowed their subject races to carry arms have 
prepared their own downfall by doing so.
        -- Adolph Hitler, April 11 1942.
