The patch based workflow support is geared towards helping the
recipient of the patches a lot more than the contributors, and to
prevent mistakes while applying the patches, "am" would stop when it
sees such an empty e-mail as you saw (in the later part of message I
am not quoting).  After all, a "format-patch" output that does not
have any patch would be indistinguishable from discussion e-mail
messages and the recipient would not want to end up with no-op
commits that record such messages.

So I think skipping no-op commit from the output was done pretty
much deliberately and it is definitely not a bug.  I however do not
think it is incorrect to say that it is a lack of feature that
nobody so far found necessary or beneficial.

I would not refuse to consider adding a new option to "format-patch"
to emit such a no-op message, and add a "having no patch is OK, just
record a no-op commit" option to "am", though.  But I do not see a
clear benefit from such change--it sounds more like a set of
"because we could" not "because we need to" changes to me.

Thanks.
