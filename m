Junio, I assume you saw Scott James Remnant blog posts, "Git Sucks"?

       http://www.netsplit.com/2009/02/17/git-sucks/
       http://www.netsplit.com/2009/02/17/git-sucks-2/
       http://www.netsplit.com/2009/02/17/git-sucks-3/

My commentary on his complaint is found here:

Some (but not all) of the comments on my blog are also worth reading.
