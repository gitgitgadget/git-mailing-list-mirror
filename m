Thanks for bringing this up I agree it can be very helpful to look at 
the original commit when resolving cherry-pick and revert conflicts. I'm 
in two minds about this change though - I wonder if it'd be better to 
improve the documentation for CHERRY_PICK_HEAD and REVERT_HEAD and tell 
users to run "git show CHERRY_PICK_HEAD" instead. I think the main 
reason we have a "--show-current-patch" option for "rebase" is that 
there are two different implementations of that command and the 
patched-based one of them does not support REBASE_HEAD. That reasoning 
does not apply to "cherry-pick" and "revert" and "--show-current-patch" 
suggests a patch-based implementation which is also not the case for 
these commands.

Best Wishes

Phillip
