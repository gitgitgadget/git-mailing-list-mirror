All correct. There is no --relative-local because "--relative" is a
historical artifact. We could support --foo for every --date=foo, but I
don't think there is a reason to do so (and reasons not to, like
avoiding cluttering the option space).

This was discussed in the earlier review. It's basically only useful if
you are feeding the output to another script which will format the date
and want to change what that script shows.

Yes, this was discussed on the list not too long ago. I think it would
be useful, but is obviously orthogonal to this series.
