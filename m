The suggestion is the otherway around. I would argue (as a viewpoint) that 
what we advertise are object IDs and their associated refs, sorted by ref 
name. (I'm thinking of the git/Documentation/technical/pack-protocol.txt 
here). My suggestion was that when we get to the sorted ref that HEAD points 
to (including the unborn oid) that we annotate that ref.

I didn't quite follow Peff's suggestion as to where the list change went and 
if that was a protocol change.

There are two current fault scenarios.
a. The currently reported case where HEAD has an unborn symref
b. The multiple ref HEAD case, where the HEAD oid matches multiple 
advertised refs, and the correct symref is not the first listed (which is 
the case I had looked at a few years ago, a prompted me to respond).


With the above discussions, we would have both a NULL oid for the unborn 
(sym)ref sent (if needed), and the (sym)ref for HEAD would have the extra 
annotation. That would at least not break the protocol rule that "If HEAD is 
not a valid ref, HEAD MUST NOT appear in the advertisement list at all" (it 
is now an annotation to another valid ref [or the unborn symref]).

My main step was that for case b, so that we don't need to 
guess_remote_head(). The annotation would have already told us.

My understanding was that the Bundle was a tiny wrapper and that it has that 
same protocol header, which was then decoded using the same code. Hence the 
hope that it could fix both the bundle and remote clone problems. I'd just 
avoided stepping into remote clone arena because of other implementations.

I hope I haven't confused the different parts of the negotiation and 
transfer, which can be confusing.
