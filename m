By the way, I did check to see whether this might help the situation
where running under "prove" we see only "Dubious..." and not the actual
error() message produced by the test script. But no, it eats both stdout
and stderr. You can sneak a line through by prepending it with "#", but
only if "prove -o" is used (and even then, it's hard to associate it
with a particular test when you're running many in parallel).

So I guess the status quo is not too bad: prove says "dubious", and then
you re-run the test with "./t1234-foo.sh -v -i" and you get to see the
error.
