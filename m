I don't think there is any commitment to mentor, or for us to even do a
project that is on the list. The intent of the idea list is to get
students thinking about their proposals, and hopefully discussing and
exploring the ideas with us on the list. It is only when it comes time
to read and rank student proposals that we make a commitment to an idea.

I actually think it may be a little bit too small for a whole summer
project. But I pushed it to the wiki for the reasons above; this is just
an ideas page, not a solid list of proposals.
