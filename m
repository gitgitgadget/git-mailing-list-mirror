Side note: Use the project title in the e-mail subject. This would help
mentors to understand what the project is about at a first glance.

"I am applying" instead of "I apply".

"on-line" project is an unusual word choice, although I understand your
sentiment. Collaborative might work better.

Nice! I use Arch too.

I have reviewed the pull request. Code changes seem look good to me but
you need to write a better commit message (as harry-hov noted). Send out
a second version as soon as you are done.

The title and a one-line description of the microproject in the proposal
would be useful.

Removing old, short placeholders like `%an` could break existing scripts
and user flow.

Having both short and descriptive placeholders would be better.

Could you elaborate on what format-scripting means? Do you mean use of
`--format` option to configure the output format?

While the two goals you have are appreciable, the broader aim of this
project is to remove *duplicate* implementation of format command
output.

You can also read up on other proposals and previous work done on this
project idea.

I have fixed some of grammatical errors but your English is
understandable.

I personally use Grammarly to fix my errors. It's not foolproof but
pretty close.

Yeah, I know the feeling. Git is one of the better communities to work

Thanks for the proposal!

I hope you have submitted the PDF draft already. Today is the deadline
and you can always re-upload later.
