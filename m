Good point. We can't really consider clone to be a blind "init + config
+ fetch + checkout" because those middle two steps sometimes overlap
each other.  It really does need to be its own beast.

Yeah, and I think that insteadOf is working as intended there (clone
sets it early enough that all of the rest of the code sees it). And the
bug is just that there's special handling in builtin/fetch.c that clone
needs to replicate.

The right solution there is probably pushing that logic down into the
transport layer. Or at the very least abstracting it into a function so
that both clone and fetch can call it without replicating the logic.

I think your patch is a strict improvement and we don't need to hold up
waiting for a perfect fix (and because of the --single-branch thing you
mentioned, this may be the best we can do anyway).

I don't think we ever want to request two ref advertisements; they're
too expensive. If clone needs to do work between the advertisement and
the actual fetch (and it sounds like it does), then it should be using
the transport layer directly. Which is what it's already doing.
