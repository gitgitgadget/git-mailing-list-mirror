Thank you for your replies.

I don't have much experience with .gitattributes, so I am not sure if I 
did everything correctly.

What I had in mind was the following:
I have files in my SVN repository which are CRLF, and some files are LF.
I wanted to tell GIT which line ending the files should have
so that they will have the exact same line endings after the repo is 
checked out. I think text=auto will also do this, maybe I should try 
that.

The "AFS" files are very special, though. Due to compatibility reasons, 
they must be in the ancient Macintosh format (CR) otherwise the program 
won't work. Do I need to state "eol=cr" then? Or will GIT automatically 
use the same line endings as in the files which I have added to SVN?

Thank you for your help!
