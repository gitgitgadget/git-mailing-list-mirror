Hello everyone,

 We are a team of 4 students from Ensimag (french computer science engi=
neering school) tutored by Matthieu Moy, doing a full-time Git project,=
 planning to work on few features during the next month.

We would like to start with microproject first,  "Add more builtin patt=
erns for userdiff" and "Make upload-pack and receive-pack use the parse=
-options api" as a warm up. Then, we would like to work on features fro=
m the SmallProjectsIdeas Page on the wiki. We don't know yet what we ca=
n implement though, we will choose after contributing on our first proj=
ect, to have a better understanding on the project as a whole.

If you have any suggestion for us, please feel free to warn us.

Best regards,

Beutin Fran=C3=A7ois, Duclot William
Queru Antoine, Rabourg simon
