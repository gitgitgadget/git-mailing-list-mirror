Yeah, that was what I was thinking. On the other hand, I'd actually find
that a little bit annoying for the non-stress case. I commonly do
"./t1234-foo.sh" in order to dig into a specific breakage, and having
the failing trash directory right there is convenient (and I don't care
as much about speed, since I'm just running it once).

I may just gut my "stress" script and make it a wrapper for calling
the script with "--stress --root=...". :)
