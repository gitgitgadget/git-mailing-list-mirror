It's not "late", it's "never". Bash 4 switched to GPLv3.

Yes, "-x" works everywhere. The problem is scripts which capture the
stderr of subshells or functions, which then get polluted by "-x"
output. You can fix that in two ways:

  1. Use bash 4.1+, which works around that with BASH_XTRACEFD.

  2. Don't do that. GÃ¡bor fixed most such instances already, except the
     ones in t1510. That one automatically disables "-x" tracing.

So I don't know what you tried exactly, but you should be able to
successfully run with "-x" on any script. Including t1510, but you
just won't get tracing output then.

I do think it basically works everywhere these days.
