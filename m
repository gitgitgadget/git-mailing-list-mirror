My original textconv caching implementation used commitless notes. The
new version uses commits, but keeps the history truncated. As far as I
know, you can manipulate the latter with git-notes, but I haven't tried
much (adding a new note should make a history graph with length 2, whic=
h
will then get re-truncated the next time we add something to the cache
automatically). But certainly "list", "show", and "prune" should work,
which are the ones I would expect to be useful for such a cache.

You would also use this to see the history of cache notes. They have
commits, but the only ancestry is in the reflog. So perhaps:

  Some notes refs may be "history-less", either because they point
  directly to a tree instead of a commit, or because their commits are
  truncated (the notes generated by textconv caching are an example of
  the latter). To see the local history of these refs, view the reflog
  with `git log -g <refname>`.
