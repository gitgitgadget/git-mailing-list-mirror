I am on two variants (x86 and ia64) of HPE NonStop with current operating systems - and I do the build/test for git and OpenSSL. getpass() an alias to getpass2() but the other procs are not present. If this is going into git, I would suggest putting something into compat.c to abstract out the call. If it's there, we can handle it on a platform-by-platform basis.
