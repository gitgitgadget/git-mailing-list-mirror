Most other documentation will frequently be read from an installation
of git so will naturally be associated with the installed version.
But these two documents in particular are often read from web pages
while users are still exploring git. It's important to mention
version 1.5.1 since these documents provide example commands that
won't work with previous versions of git.

---

This really tripped up a recent friend who tried to go through the
tutorial on the web page while following along with a 1.4 version of
git, and got very confused.

There's definitely a bunch more that could be done here, (include a
paragraph explaining which version of git is necessary, mention where
to go to upgrade git, call out particular commands that require
specific versions of git, dynamically generate the version that gets
stuck into the documentation, etc.). But I just went with the most
minimal think I could think of to solve the problem
