Well, skipping it while applying the rest is bad form anyway, isn't
it? I think "bounce the whole series on any problem" reduces load on
the maintainer and helps the submitter learn by fixing up the patch
series personally rather than trusting the maintainer to do it.

As soon as there's anything broken in the series, the patch boundaries
aren't that interesting to me anymore. At that point, I just reply to
the whole thing and strip the reply down to the stuff worth commenting
on.

So, my style is accept or bounce, and during the bounce, I'll just
review the whole thing while quoted in my reply buffer.

That seems to work for me anyway, without a one-patch-per email
approach, (in fact, one-patch-per-email would be a lot more awkward
for replying to the whole series and quoting similar or related issues
as I like to do).
