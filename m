There was hardly a mess to clean-up, and clearly this pattern is new to
me, too :).

I'm planning on resubmitting my tb/reverse-midx series as soon as it
gets another set of reviewer eyes with these four or five patches as new
at the beginning.

I do wonder about the merge conflicts caused between this and your
chunk-format API series. I'd rather not create such conflicts for Junio,
and last I recall there were still some outstanding comments on that
series. So long as you don't think that you resolving those comments
would cause new conflicts, I would assume that Junio's rerere cache
would make applying both easy enough.

If you do think it would cause new conflicts, it may make sense for you
to rebase your branch on mine, but I'm not sure if that's something
you'd want to do or not.
