Hello,

I was looking for a french speaking place to discuss about Git, Hg, SVN 
and all other SCM in use and did not find.

This is then an attempt to create one.
I created a Google group:
https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/sgcs-fr

I invite french sepaking people to join.

The group wouldn't be limited to one SCM but is global.
The topic is the usage of all of them.

Thank you.
