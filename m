You hit the nail on the head.  I get tired of doing exactly that.  Just 
south of me 20-40 miles is the location of SCO Lindon, Utah.  I have to 
make it really clear in most things I do that I understand and totally 
support the GPL.  I have done work for said group and always add in my 
contracts that what is being done has to support the GPL and strict 
compliance is necessary.  All changes will be sent upstream for inclusion 
at the project head.  Whether they are added or not is really not the 
issue.  I want any and all changes to follow what ever licence they are 
under and everything has to be in compliance with the licences.

Thanks,
