If you're interested in cross-platformness, you might want to be
aware that there is already at least another 'yap' in Windows:
MikTeX's DVI viewer (Yet Another Previewer). Just FYI.

This is an extremely interesting idea. I've always wondered myself
if it were possible to make git-svn operation more transparent,
although it has always been my understanding that the interface
difference might be substantially driven by robustness, especially
for 'roundtrip' operation, and by the fact that svn would not
really be suited for some of the operations that are common in git
workflow. It'll be interesting to see the level of transparency
that can be achieved without bringing down the svn server ;)

I think that the most complex situations arise from cloning svn
repositories that undergo heavy structure changes in their
history, moving from a structure where there was no
trunk/branches/tags because the project was just kept in the svn
root, to thetraditional trunk/branches/tags structure (I've come
across at least two svn repositories like this in the past, and
git-svn used to have quite some problems in importing them
directely, although I haven't tried it recently).
