This patch caught my attention, and I think I understand some of the issues
at hand. I'm not well-versed specifically in Git's bitmap implementation.
The fundamental ideas are there, but my perspective is biased by my own
independent bitmap implementation for Azure Repos. What worked there may not
work at all here.

This is the "commit frontier" which I bring up again below.

(As I read your discussion below, I'm confused. For "C..D", C is a have
and D is a want. We should explore all the haves _first_, then walk the
wants, right?)

I may be misreading something, but we would construct _a_ bitmap for C
by walking its reachable objects until hitting a bitmap we know about.
Perhaps A or B have a bitmap to start the construction. If we never
construct a bitmap for C, then we don't know what to remove from the "D"
bitmap to show the difference.

If "C" is not even in the bitmap pack, then we don't use bitmaps for
this calculation because of this condition:

        /*
         * if we have a HAVES list, but none of those haves is contained
         * in the packfile that has a bitmap, we don't have anything to
         * optimize here
         */
        if (haves && !in_bitmapped_pack(bitmap_git, haves))
                goto cleanup;

I'm of the opinion that the old method was better. It followed a very clear
three-step process:

 1. Compute the "haves" bitmap.

 2. Compute the "wants" bitmap, but don't explore into the "haves" bitmap.

 3. Subtract the "haves" bitmap from the "wants" (in case we added bits to
    the wants before they were in the haves).

But there is hope in your idea to improve some cases. As noted, we give up
if all of the haves are not in the bitmapped pack. By starting with a
commit walk, we can find the "commit frontier," which is the set of commits
that are explored by paint_down_to_common(). In this case, the set {B, C, D}.

After walking commits and finding a set of UNINTERESTING commits, we could
look for any UNINTERESTING commits that have bitmaps (or simply are in the
bitmapped pack) and use those to see our "haves" bitmap. So, if B has a
bitmap, but C is too new for the bitmap, then we can still create the haves
based on B and then take a bitmap diff "D minus B".

In fact, using the "merge base set" for the diff reflects what the non-bitmap
algorithm does in this case. It ignores C and only explores B.

I learned a lot looking at both versions of this method side-by-side. Thanks!
