In an extremely roundabout way, yes. That -40643156 time zone really is
"minus 46 years", but it was generated by _different_ code trying to
compute the author timezone on the fly and using a stray "-1". So I
suspect that no matter what time you ask for in the year 2152 (or
later), the same process would end up with the 2106 time, as the
timezone is custom-computed to end up back at the same error point.
