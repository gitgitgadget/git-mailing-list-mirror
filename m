Thank you for your response and the technical explanation.

I second this. For me, the commit diff should include the "real"/full
commit diff. Even if the user didn't actually make some changes, the
commit they're about to make will include them, so it's completely
relevant to show these changes.
That's the behaviour I was expecting, and I was confused that Git
didn't behave that way.
To me, Git shouldn't really care where changes come from; they are
part of the commit so must logically be shown in the commit diff while
committing.

Thank you,
