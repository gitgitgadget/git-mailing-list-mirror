This is bad, since it forces users to do one thing first and then do 
what they're used to. Better to have the script add

-include config.mak.autogen

LAST in config.mak, unless it's already in the file and generate 
config.mak.autogen with configure.

Since Make does things bottoms-up (much like swedish students and 
midsummer celebrators), the previous hand-edited defaults in config.mak 
will beat the ones in config.mak.autogen (a good thing).

I wouldn't want my long-standing, functioning config.mak overwritten, 
but I *might* be interested in trying some of the options provided by 
./configure.
