Yeah, trapping on more signals seems reasonable (or just propagating INT
instead of TERM). I'm more worried about this one:

Hmm, yeah. The patch I sent earlier already propagates through the
subshell, so this is really just another layer there. I.e., would it be
reasonable when we are using --verbose-log (or --tee) for the parent
process to propagate signals down to child it spawned?

That would fix this case, and it would make things more predictable in
general (e.g., a user who manually runs kill).

It does feel like a lot of boilerplate to be propagating these signals
manually. I think the "right" Unix-y solution here is process groups:
each sub-job should get its own group, and then the top-level runner
script can kill the whole group. We may run into portability issues,
though (setsid is in util-linux, but I don't know if there's an
equivalent elsewhere; a small perl or C helper could do it, but I have
no idea what that would mean on Windows).

I think you get ABORTED because we are just watching for the
parent-process to exit (and reporting its status). The fact that that
the subshell (and the tee) are still running is not important. That all
makes sense to me.

Yeah, I don't understand the SIGINT behavior you're seeing with bash. I
can't replicate it with bash 4.4.23 (from Debian unstable).
