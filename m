I see. That's strange, I've been using "apt-get upgrade xxx" for at least a
couple years, I can't believe I never knew that! Thanks for the detailed
info, everyone (and for the patience!)

In answer to someone's question, yea, it's Ubuntu (Kubuntu 10.04, and yea, I
know that's old, but it's not my primary system and I haven't had a chance
yet to upgrade it and get everything set back up again). I also tried it on
a Debian 6 Live/Persistent system and got the same results...apparently for
the same reason.

I did manage to get 1.7.8 installed (on both systems) by downloading and
installing the source (it was kind of a pain figuring out the names of some
of the dependent packages, but I managed to get it.)

So hopefully this should all work now...
