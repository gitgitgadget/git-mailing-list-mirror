List-ID: <git.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: git@vger.kernel.org

Some asciidoc formatting errors and some minor formatting inconsistencies in
hash-function-transition.txt were fixed.

Content-wise the rationale for choosing SHA-256 was shortened a little bit
and moved to the beginning of the document. Also an incomplete sentence was
corrected.

Changes since v2:

 * Move a stray change from 1/6 back to 2/6; fix an incomplete conversion in
   2/6.
 * Rework rationale based on the comments from Junio and Brian.
 * Rebased on current master.

Changes since v1:

 * Better commit messages.

 * Details on SHA-1 weaknesses were removed from the rationale.

 * All http links to lore.kernel.org in the tree were changed to https
   links.
   
   Thanks to Ã†var, Junio and Brian for their suggestions and help.
