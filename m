Even if I were in a better mood, the whole thread has a back story on an 
msysGit issue, and this led me to try to stop what I feared would become a 
rather long mail thread without much of an outcome, such as that infamous 
thread about MacOSX UTF-8 filename handling.

Alas, it seems that Robin is willing to work on the issues, so my fears 
have been totally and completely unfounded.

Ciao,
Dscho
