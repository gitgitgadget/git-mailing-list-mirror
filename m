As far as I count as "people", I'd say you are plain nuts.  And it is
not like I remember any useful contribution of yours, anyhow.

In my opinion, JH is doing a splendid job.  You don't seem to have
watched it too closely, though.  You are not even able to spell his
name, and you obviously have no clue about the state of affairs anyway.
If you think you can do a better job, feel free to do so: since git is
developed using distributed version control, everybody can make his own
forks and still continue sharing code and patches.  We have this
situation with the Linux kernel (where we have Linus kernels, Morton
kernels, Molnar kernels and so on), all quite amicably.

A similar branching out is not really visible for git itself (apart from
the msys-git branch which is slated for eventual reintegration), and
that's exactly because Junio's work leaves so very little to be desired.
