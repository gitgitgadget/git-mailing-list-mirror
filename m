I'm not sure. I think the topic would have graduated if either you had
just applied the squash and merged it down, or if the original author
had checked back in over the intervening year to say "hey, what happened
to my patch" (either by reading "what's cooking" or manually).

I suspect drive-by contributors might not realize they need to do the
latter in some cases, but I wouldn't have counted 2014-era Ã†var in that
boat. So I dunno.
