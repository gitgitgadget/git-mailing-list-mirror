As Dscho wrote, I should think not, but having a company basing its business
around an opensource product usually means a lot of company-like features
get implemented, such as various forms of reporting, documentation, integration
with bugtrackers and trouble-ticket systems, etc, etc...

It is the way of companies to throw money rather than competence at temporary
problems, while more altruistic organizations such as opensource projects do
the exact opposite.

I for one would love if some support company could give git courses in sweden,
since that'd mean I wouldn't have to. ;-)
