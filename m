Those cases are actually much older than that. I just didn't bother to
clean them up until recently. So my rate is even lower :)

Yeah, unless somebody is complaining, I don't know that it's worth
worrying about too much. The test suite is certainly useful without
being able to use "-x" on every single test run (you can still run it
without "-x" obviously, or selectively use "-x" to debug a single test
or script). So if it is only unreliable on a few tests on a few obscure
shells, we can probably live with it until somebody demonstrates a
real-world problem (e.g., that they're running automated CI on an
obscure platform that is stuck with an old shell, and really want "-x
--verbose-log" to get more verbose failures).

Yeah, I think this is probably an issue even with bash.

I think it's just that checking the environment variable is non-trivial:
we invoke env--helper to handle bool interpretation. So we'd prefer to
cache the result (and not to run it at all if a test script doesn't use
i18ngrep, though it's perhaps ubiquitous enough that we should just run
it up front for every script).

That might be worth doing, though IIRC it got kind of hairy. :)
