Thanks, I'll make a note. I split it into:

  [Existing affiliations...]
  Part of Junio Hamano's time on git is funded by his employer.

  [Past Affiliations...]
  Part of Junio Hamano's time on git used to be funded by NEC, but that
  is no longer the case.

Do you want to mention your employer by name?
