Yeah, I could take it or leave it if we follow that other route.

Yes, I agree it's not likely to help anybody. I did it mostly for
consistency. I.e., to say "and we are meaning to send this directly to
the user". It actually might make sense to wrap that concept in a helper
function. Arguably "say" should do this redirection automatically (we do
redirect it elsewhere, but mostly to try to accomplish the same thing).

Yeah, I just missed those. I agree they should redirect to fd 4, too.

I'm trying to clear my inbox before traveling, so I probably won't dig
into this further for a while. If you think this is the right direction,
do you want to add more ">&4" redirects to helpers as part of your
series?
