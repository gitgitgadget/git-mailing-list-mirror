Hey guys,

I was just wondering what is happening with git notes stuff? I really
like the idea of being able to annotate commits with various
information.

After the gittogether it sounded like we had a solid proposal and
possible implementation, has anything happened since then? I had a quick
look over the archives but didn't seem much mention of them in the last
couple of weeks.

Thanks for your help.

PS I'm going to try harder to find the time to continue to work on the
git-media cloning stuff, been a bit snowed under at work.
