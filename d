Dear git@vger.kernel.org ,

I am sorry for invading your privacy because we do not know each 
other
but I am contacting you because of my late client who died 
without a
will.
This is to notify you that your are the beneficiary to the 
bequest of
the sum of  £10,500,000.00 GBP in the intent of my deceased 
client.
If you accept please forward your full names, current address and 
your
direct cell for the court documentations and so that we can 
obtain the
probate division of court papers required for you to claim the 
funds
from the holding bank.


Thanks,
Steven Walter
