Hello there, I sent you an email a few days with a proposal that I think you will be interested in because it is of mutual benefit. Did you receive the email? I am not if you got it because I did not receive a reply from you and my mailbox has been acting up lately. Could you please reply me directly on my private mailbox: peterddeng2000@secsuremailer.com and let me know if you got the proposal and if you are interested in working with me to accomplish the proposed project.

I await your response on my private mailbox above.

Regards,

Peter.
