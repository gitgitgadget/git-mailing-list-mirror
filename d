=46rom: Antonio Costa

Important: if you have interest in this proposition, and would like to
communicate with us, you may only send your emails to
antoniocost1@aol.co.uk as emails sent anywhere else may not be seen.

I am sending this email on behalf of my employer who wants to work
with you. We have found your contact information on the Internet
business directory of your country.

My employer is the Director of Finance House, UK. We are based in
Scotland and provide consultation to clients wishing to invest in the
UK. For clients investing elsewhere, we work with
associates/consultants, and we have a client that has chosen your
country as a good destination to use her assets as investments but we
presently do not have any associates in your country.

We have therefore decided to get other professionals, like you, based
in your country to collaborate with us in investing and managing our
client=E2=80=99s assets. Her priority will be Property Development and
Tourism, whereas we would also consider partnering with companies in
other sectors such as Healthcare, Agriculture/Agribusiness and
Renewable Energy. It is important to note that the amount to be
invested is USD 60, 000, 000 (Sixty Million US Dollars).

I have sent you this missive as a proposition. If you are interested,
and have projects that need funding, we can finance them. As I advised
above, our client has chosen your country after closely studying the
economic forecasts.

At this moment, I am not sure you will have any interest in this
process so I will give just the basic details. If you would like to
work with us, do respond to the email addresses already given above,
otherwise, I apologize for any inconvenience caused.

Yours Sincerely.

Antonio Costa
