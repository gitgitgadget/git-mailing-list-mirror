Barton Burrell

So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent. The e-mail of the species is more deadly than the mail. When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for there are seven abominations in his heart.

A rolling stone gathers no moss. A stitch in time saves nine. Cultivate money and you grow rich, Cultivate mind and you raise culture When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you. The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence

Never play leapfrog with a unicorn
