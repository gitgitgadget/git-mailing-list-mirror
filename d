Hello Dear,
My name is, Miss Adab Elisa Essame,
I'm contacting because I want to be your friend and confide in you because I have in my possession now 178.73 Kilograms of Gold Bars, Quality: 22carat, that I inherited from my late mother which I want to ship to your country and sell for investment in your country because I want to leave Cote d'Ivoire and relocate to your country to continue my education in your country. I want you to stand by me as my tutor and ship this Gold Bars to your country and sell for investment in your country. Note that I am writing you this email purely on the ground of trust because I don't know you and we have not met before. I found you here and my mind convinced me that I can trust you.
Waiting to hear from you.
Miss Adab Elisa Essame.
