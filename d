Good day,

I believe that you will be anxious to know the kind of business proposition that I have for you. Well, I am soliciting your assistance to be able to transfer a huge amount of money $20,500,000.00 from my bank that is lying idle with no one ever coming to lay claim to it. Let me know if you are interested.

Regards,
Sarah Bojing
