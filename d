Dear International Sales & Marketing Director,
Zhejiang Wuchuan Industrial Co., Ltd

Hello, this is Eiichi Hasegawa from LIFESTYLE EXPO TOKYO Show Management.
Are you considering expanding your business to Japan, Asia-Pacific?

If yes, this is your chance to exhibit at LIFESTYLE EXPO TOKYO 2019 [January]!
>> https://www.lifestyle-expo-spring.jp/en/

----- 3 Key Reasons Why You Should Exhibit at LIFESTYLE EXPO TOKYO -----

1. January is the best time to approach Japanese buyers.
    Japan's fiscal year starts in April, so January is your chance to have your products selected in the buyers' budget for 2019.

2. You can approach the buyers before anyone else does.
    This will be the year's first trade show for the buyers.
    They will be more motivated to purchase and conduct business for the coming year and their new budget (fiscal 2019 starts from April).
      
3. Meet and approach buyers from other industries to further expand your business.
    Exhibitors can meet a huge variety of visitors from different industries because LIFESTYLE EXPO TOKYO consists of 6 specialised shows.
    You can take advantage of the synergy effects by meeting many key buyers/distributors who are visiting the other shows.
