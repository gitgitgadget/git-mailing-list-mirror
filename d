Hello

In my search for a business partner i got your contact in google 
search. My client is willing to invest $10 Million to $500 
million but my client said he need a trusted partner who he can 
have a meeting at the point of releasing his funds. 

I told my client that you have a good profile with your company 
which i got details about you on my search on google lookup. Can 
we trust you. 

Can we make a plan for a long term business relationship.

Please reply.
