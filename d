   I guess there isnt good news

   I setup an very small malware in a porn website (adult videowebsite) and  
you viewed the videos (you know what im talking,).

   While you were watching the videos my malvware started to work as a RDP  
(remote desktop view) with a keylogger and i had access to your device  
screen and camera.

   My malvware also collected your contacts (from email, social network,  
etc...)

   After this i started to record your screen and your camera at the same  
time. So i created an double-screen video (half side your camera watching  
porn and half side your screen).

   As you might be thinking i had a lot of trouble doing all this.

   You might be worried at this point but dont be, its simple to fix all  
this mess, all you have to do is pay me U$350, this value is enough to keep  
our little secret safe.

   You will make my payment through Bitcoin (if you dont know how to buy  
Bitcoin search on google, its fast and easy, i recommend localbitcoins).

   The Bitcoin address you have to send the money is:  
1EQ1SWvxFHfCq3ENjrCUN1KKwdK8XnrgkR

   You only have 24 hours to send my money after reading this e-mail (i  
setup an special tracking pixel in this message and i will know when you  
read it).

   If i do not receive my Bitcoins i will send your double-screen video to  
all contacts that i collected from you (including friends, co-workers,  
family).

   If you are wise enough and send my money all the material will be deleted  
and you will not hear from me again.
