Attn; Sir

I hope that my proposal will not affect your believes or religion; I
have contacted you because you share the same last name with my client
Engr. Staphane  who I represent.

I represented a client who passed on due a heart-related condition and
I believe with your assistance and for the reason that you share the
same last name with my client, we can receive the investments/deposits
of my deceased client ($15,500,000.00 USD) which he left in the Bank
of East Asia New York before his death.

All I need from you is honesty from your side and to keep all
transaction secret until we achieve this aim which will definitely
change our lives for good. If you agree to work with me, I have all
the proves and documents that I will present to the bank to enable
them transfer the money into your account with out any problem or
risk.

I will offer you 40% of the total money and we will set 5% for the
expenses incurred in the course of this transaction while 55% will be
for me.

If you agree for my proposition, you can write me a reply mail and
indicate your interest then I will give you further guideline on how
we will go about this transaction which will not take more than 14
working days to get the money transferred into your account from the
Bank of East Asia New York. Send me the following information so that
we can proceed.

Your Full Name
Full address
Age
Occupation
Mobile Number

I await your urgent response and corporation.

Thanks
Barrister Richard Thomas
