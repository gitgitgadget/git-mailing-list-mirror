Luther Bynum




Never say die No great genius has ever existed without some touch of madness He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.

  Two's company, three's.. the musketeers.Any fool can criticise, condemn and complain and most fools do

 as dry as chapped lips
